1. The flutist lives in the second house. So, we know:
   - House 2: Flutist

2. The person with the tulips lives right next to the guitarist. Since the flutist is in House 2, the only way this can work is if:

"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has apples.

2. **The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has high heels.

3. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means if the truck driver is in House 1, the SUV owner is in House 2. If the truck driver is in House 2, the SUV owner is in House 3. If the truck driver is in House 3, the SUV owner is in House 4.

4. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - This means if the person wearing loafers is in House 1, the person driving a convertible is in House 2. If the person wearing loafers is in House 2, the person driving a convertible is in House 3. If the person wearing loafers is in House 3, the person driving a convertible is in House 4.

5. **The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.**
   - So, the truck driver can't be in House 4.

6. **The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - So, the tea drinker can't be in House 4.

7. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - So, the coffee drinker can't be in House 1.

8. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.**
   - So, the pizza eater can't be in House 4.

9. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - So, the root beer lover can't be in House 4.

10. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.**
    - So, if the pizza eater is in House 2, the mango eater is in House 1 or 3. If the pizza eater is in House 3, the mango eater is in House 2 or 4.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1 has apples.
- House 3 has high heels.
- The truck driver can't be in House 4, so they must be in House 1 or 2.
- The SUV owner must be in House 2 or 3.
- The person wearing loafers can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or 2.
- The person driving a convertible must be in House 2 or 3.
- The tea drinker can't be in House 4, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The pizza eater can't be in House 4, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The root beer lover can't be in House 4, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The pizza eater and the mango eater must be next to each other.

If the pizza eater is in House 3, the mango eater must be in House 2. But House 2 can't have both the mango eater and the person wearing loafers. So, the pizza eater must be in House 2, and the mango eater must be in House 1.

Since House 1 has apples, the mango eater can't be in House 1. So, the pizza eater must be in House 3, and the mango eater must be in House 2.

Since the pizza eater is in House 3, the person in House 3 is wearing high heels. So, the person in House 2 is the mango eater.

Since the person in House 2 is the mango eater, the person in House 1 must be the apple eater.

The tea drinker can't be in House 4, and they can't be in House 3 (pizza eater) or House 2 (mango eater). So, the tea drinker must be in House 1.

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - So, we know right away that the person in House 5 ate grilled cheese.

2. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza could be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not House 1.

3. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are next to each other, with the root beer lover on the left.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.**
   - So, the person in House 5 drinks water and ate grilled cheese.

5. **The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, with the coffee drinker on the left.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.**
   - So, the person in House 3 ate spaghetti.

7. **The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are next to each other.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 5:** We know this person drinks water and ate grilled cheese.
- **House 3:** We know this person ate spaghetti.
- **House 2:** Since the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, the coffee drinker must be in House 2.
- **House 1:** The root beer lover must be in House 1 because they live directly left of the person who had stew, and House 2 is already taken by the coffee drinker.
- **House 4:** The person who had stew must be in House 4 because they live next to the person who likes milk, and House 3 is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 5.

The answer is: (A) 5"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.**
   - This means the soccer player can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person eating oranges can't be in the first house (House 1).

2. **The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

   - This means the person eating mangos can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person with tulips can't be in the first house (House 1).

4. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.**
   - This means the person eating oranges can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person with daffodils can't be in the first house (House 1).

Now, let's put this all together:

- The person eating oranges can only be in House 1 or House 2.
- The person with daffodils can only be in House 2 or House 3.
- The swimmer and the person with daffodils must be next to each other, so if the person with daffodils is in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 1 or House 3. But the person eating oranges can't be in House 3, so the person with daffodils must be in House 3, and the swimmer must be in House 2.

So, the person with daffodils must be in House 3.

The answer is: **(C) 3**."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The violinist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the violinist.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
   - This means the person with daffodils can't be in the third house, and the percussionist can't be in the first house. So, the person with daffodils must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second or third house.

3. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. If the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house, but that doesn't work because the percussionist can't be in the third house if the person with daffodils is in the first house. So, the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.

4. **The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.**
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

5. **The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - The mystery book reader can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first or second house. The science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

6. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.**
   - If the history book buff is in the third house, the person with the radio must be in the first house. If the history book buff is in the first house, the person with the radio must be in the third house, but that doesn't work because the history book buff can't be in the first house. So, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the person with the radio must be in the first house.

7. **The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.**
   - The person with the phone must be in the third house because the history book buff is there. So, the person with the tulips must be in the second house.

8. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This confirms that the person with the tulips is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in **House 2**.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The bird keeper doesn't live in the first house.** So, the bird keeper must be in either the second or third house.
2. **The mystery book reader lives in the second house.** So, the second house has the mystery book reader.
3. **The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house.** Since the bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, they must be in the second house. So, the second house has the bird keeper and the mystery book reader.
4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has lilies.** This means the history book buff is in the first house, and the person with lilies is in the second house.
5. **The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.** This means the percussionist is in the first house, and the person with the computer is in the second house.
6. **The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the first house.** So, the fish enthusiast must be in either the second or third house. But since the second house already has the bird keeper and the mystery book reader, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.
7. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.** This means the person with the gameboy is in the first house, and the person with the rose bouquet is in the second house.
8. **The cellist doesn't live in the third house.** So, the cellist must be in either the first or second house. But the second house is already full, so the cellist must be in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **First House:**
  - History book buff
  - Percussionist

  - Fish enthusiast (but we know the fish enthusiast is in the third house, so this must be a different person)
- **Second House:**

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

We have two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2). Each house has a person with different stuff:

1. Different shoes: one wears sandals, one wears boots.
2. Different books: one likes mystery books, one likes history books.
3. Different cars: one drives a convertible, one drives a truck.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives next to the history book buff. This means the person with the convertible is in House 1, and the history book buff is in House 2.
2. The person who wears boots doesn't live in House 1. So, the person in House 2 must be wearing boots.

If the person in House 2 is wearing boots, then the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house is the golfer's house.

2. **The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
   - This means the swimmer and the romance book lover are next to each other, with the swimmer on the left. They can't be in the first house because that's the golfer's house. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **The swimmer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the swimmer must be in house 2, and the romance book lover must be in house 3.

4. **The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.**
   - So, the basketball player can only be in houses 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is the golfer's house, and house 2 is the swimmer's house. That leaves house 3 for the basketball player.

5. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - They must be next to each other, with the mystery book reader on the left. The only houses left are 3 and 4. Since the basketball player is in house 3, the mystery book reader must be in house 3, and the history book buff must be in house 4.

So, the basketball player lives in house 3.

The answer is **(A) 3**."
"Well, let's see. We got a bunch of clues here, and we need to figure out where the mystery book reader lives. 

- Clue 3 tells us right away that the mystery book reader is in the third house. That's pretty straightforward, ain't it?

So, the answer is (B) 3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different device and a different favorite color. We need to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start with the devices:
- The person with the gameboy is directly left of the person with the computer. So, the gameboy must be in House 1, and the computer must be in House 2.
- That means the phone must be in House 3.

Now, let's look at the colors:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the gameboy is in House 1, the person who likes green must be in House 1.
- The person who likes yellow cannot be in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.
- That leaves the person in House 2 to like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green, Gameboy
- House 2: Blue, Computer
- House 3: Yellow, Phone

The person with the computer lives in House 2.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Root Beer Lover in House 3**: We know the root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Person Who Likes Red in House 3**: The person who likes red also lives in the third house. So, House 3 is the root beer lover who likes red.

3. **Romance Book Lover Not in House 1**: The romance book lover can't be in the first house. So, they must be in House 2, 3, or 4.
4. **History Book Buff Not in House 4**: The history book buff can't be in the fourth house. So, they must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
5. **Romance Book Lover Directly Left of History Book Buff**: The romance book lover must be directly to the left of the history book buff. Since the romance book lover can't be in House 1, the only possible pair is House 1: Romance and House 2: History.

6. **Mystery Book Reader Not in House 4**: The mystery book reader can't be in the fourth house. So, they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 is the romance book lover and House 2 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in House 2.

7. **Tea Drinker Not in House 2**: The tea drinker can't be in the second house. So, they must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since House 1 is the romance book lover and House 3 is the root beer lover, the tea drinker must be in House 4.

8. **Two Houses Between White and Coffee**: There are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. The only possible positions are:
   - House 1: White, House 4: Coffee
   - House 4: White, House 1: Coffee

   Since House 1 is the romance book lover, the only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Romance, Water (since the root beer and coffee are already assigned)
   - House 2: History, Mystery, Green (since the person who likes green must be to the left of the coffee drinker)
   - House 3: Red, Root Beer
   - House 4: White, Coffee, Tea

9. **Coffee Drinker to the Right of Green**: The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green, which is consistent with our current arrangement.

So, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(B) 4**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green, and the person in house 2 has a radio.

2. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 1 reads fantasy books.

3. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast.

4. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza for lunch.

Now, let's put it all together:
- In house 1, we have someone who likes green, reads fantasy books, and must have had spaghetti for lunch (since the person in house 2 had pizza).
- In house 2, we have someone who has a radio, is a fish enthusiast, and had pizza for lunch.

2. **The flutist lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has kiwis and a flutist.

3. **The cat lover lives in the first house.**
   - So, House 1 has kiwis, a flutist, and a cat.

4. **The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.**
   - Since the person eating kiwis is in House 1, the person who drinks water must be in House 2, 3, or 4. The person who likes milk can't be in House 1 (already has a cat) or House 3 (clue 7), so they must be in House 2 or 4. If the person who likes milk is in House 2, the person who drinks water must be in House 3.

8. **There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.**
   - The possible pairs are (House 1: Apples, House 3: Oranges) or (House 2: Apples, House 4: Oranges). Since House 1 is already occupied by the person eating kiwis, the only valid pair is (House 2: Apples, House 4: Oranges).

9. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This is consistent with our previous deduction that the person eating oranges is in House 4.

10. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.**
    - The bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 is already occupied by the cat, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 3. The tea drinker must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the person who drinks water, the bird keeper must be in House 2, and the tea drinker must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- **House 1: Kiwis, Flutist, Cat, Root Beer**
- **House 2: Apples, Guitarist, Horses, Milk**

    - This means if the person eating apples is in house 2, the person eating mangos is in house 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- From Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, if the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the person with the rose bouquet is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, if the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. So, if the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who had stew is in house 3.
- From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person with tulips live next to each other. So, if the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with tulips is in house 1 or 3. But since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis. If the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person eating kiwis is in house 4. But the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, so the person eating oranges must be in house 2, and the person eating kiwis must be in house 5.
- From Clue 10, the person eating oranges is to the right of the person with carnations. So, the person with carnations must be in house 1.
- From Clue 11, the person eating apples is directly left of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating apples must be in house 4, and the person eating mangos must be in house 5.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 3.

3. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the daffodils person can only be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house has a cat lover, and the third house has a dog owner, so the daffodils person must be in the fourth house.

4. **There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.**
   - This means the houses with horses and carnations are separated by one house. The only way this can work is if the horses are in the first house and the carnations are in the third house, or the horses are in the third house and the carnations are in the first house. But the first house has a cat lover, and the third house has a dog owner, so the horses must be in the fourth house, and the carnations must be in the second house.

5. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - Since the horses are in the fourth house, the lilies person must be in the fourth house as well.

   - Since they live next to each other, one must be in House 1 and the other in House 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Phone, Boots
- House 2: Not Boots

Since the person in House 1 has boots, the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

Next, we need to figure out the pets and devices:
- The person in House 1 has a phone, so they can't have a radio. That means the person in House 2 has a radio.
- Since the person in House 1 has a phone and boots, and the person with the radio lives next to the person with horses, the person in House 1 must have horses.
- The only pet left is the dog, so the person in House 2 must have the dog.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

### Clue 5: The root beer lover lives right next to the person with the SUV.
- The root beer lover can't be in House 4 because there's no house to the right. So, the root beer lover must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the root beer lover is in House 1, the SUV must be in House 2.
- If the root beer lover is in House 2, the SUV must be in House 3.
- If the root beer lover is in House 3, the SUV must be in House 4.

- If the root beer lover is in House 1, the SUV must be in House 2, and the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2. This is a contradiction.
- If the root beer lover is in House 2, the SUV must be in House 3, and the person who ate fried rice must be in House 1 or 3. This is a contradiction.

From Clue 1:
- The person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

From Clue 2:
- The person with loafers must be in House 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2.

From Clue 6:
- The person with the sedan and the person who drinks water must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 2 and House 4. Since House 2 is already occupied by the person who ate fried rice, the person with the sedan must be in House 1, and the person who drinks water must be in House 4.

From Clue 8:
- The person with the convertible must be in House 3, and the person who drinks water must be in House 4.

Let's start filling in the houses:

- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver

Since the swimmer does not live in the first house and must be directly left of the sedan owner, the only possible pair is (2, 3).

- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Sedan owner (Root beer lover)

The basketball player and the truck driver must be next to each other, with the basketball player on the left. The only possible pair left is (1, 2).

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Truck driver

The truck driver lives directly left of the person with carnations, so the person with carnations must be in House 3.

- House 3: Carnations (Sedan owner, Root beer lover)

The person with lilies must be to the right of the basketball player, so the lilies must be in House 4.

- House 4: Lilies (Minivan driver)

The daffodils must be next to the lilies, so the daffodils must be in House 3.

- House 3: Daffodils (Sedan owner, Root beer lover)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- House 1: Basketball player, SUV (since the truck is in House 2 and the minivan is in House 4)
- House 2: Truck driver, Carnations
- House 3: Sedan owner, Daffodils, Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver, Lilies

The tennis player must be to the left of the tea drinker, and there is one house between the coffee drinker and the tennis player. The only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, SUV, Water (since the root beer is in House 3 and the tea and coffee are not yet placed)
- House 2: Truck driver, Carnations, Coffee
- House 3: Sedan owner, Daffodils, Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver, Lilies, Tea

  - So, the first house has the tea drinker and the person eating apples.

- **Second House:**
  - The person driving the minivan must be here because the person eating apples is in the first house.
  - The person eating oranges can't be here, so they must be in the third house.

- **Third House:**
  - The person eating oranges is here.
  - The person driving the convertible is here.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- **House 3**: Yellow
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese
- **House 4**: Blue
- **House 2**: High Heels

From Clue 11, the cat lover and dog owner must be in consecutive houses. Since House 3 is yellow, the cat lover and dog owner cannot be in House 3. Also, the cat lover cannot be in House 5 (Grilled Cheese). So, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the dog owner in House 2.

- **House 1**: Cat Lover
- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels

From Clue 16, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in House 4, the person who has a gameboy must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese, Gameboy

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. So, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

- **House 1**: Cat Lover, Sandals
- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels, Horses
- **House 3**: Yellow, Television
- **House 4**: Blue, Fried Rice
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese, Gameboy

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in House 5 (Grilled Cheese) or House 4 (Fried Rice), the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1, 2, or 3. The person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in House 5 (Gameboy) or House 4 (Fried Rice), the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels, Horses

- **House 2:**
  - Golfer (from Clue 1)
  - Guitarist (from Clue 3)
  - History book buff (from Clue 2)

2. The baseball player lives in the second house. So, the person in the second house is the baseball player.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the person in the second house drives a convertible.

Now, we know the second house has:
- Someone eating grapes
- A baseball player
- Someone who drives a convertible

That means the first house must have:
- Someone eating mangos (since the other person is eating grapes)
- A cricketer (since the other person is a baseball player)

   - The root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since there are only two houses, the person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 2 because there's no house to the right of it. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

2. **Soccer Player and Mystery Book Reader:**
   - The soccer player lives directly to the left of the mystery book reader. Since there are only two houses, the soccer player must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

- From clue 1, the person who drives a minivan must live to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the minivan driver must be in house 4. But house 4 is already occupied by the dog owner, so the minivan driver must be in house 2.

- From clue 3, the truck driver (house 1) is directly left of the sedan owner. Since the minivan driver is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 3.

- The only house left is house 2, which must be the horse owner. The only car left is the SUV, so the horse owner must drive an SUV.

- The cat lover cannot live in house 2 (clue 5), so the cat lover must live in house 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:** Tea drinker
- **House 2:** Pizza eater (since the tea drinker is in House 1)
- **House 3 and House 4:** The white liker and the water drinker are neighbors, and the spaghetti eater is to the left of the water drinker. So, the spaghetti eater must be in House 3, and the water drinker must be in House 4.

So far, we have:
- **House 1:** Tea drinker
- **House 2:** Pizza eater
- **House 3:** Spaghetti eater
- **House 4:** Water drinker

Now, let's figure out the rest:
- The milk drinker must be in House 1 (since the spaghetti eater is in House 3).
- The coffee drinker must be in House 1 (since the yellow liker is in House 2).
- The yellow liker is in House 2 (since the coffee drinker is in House 1).
- The white liker is in House 3 (since the water drinker is in House 4).
- The green liker is in House 4 (since the green liker is not in House 1).

So, the person who likes green lives in House 4.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer can't be in the last house (House 3), and the basketball player can't be in the first house (House 1). So, the golfer must be in House 1 or House 2, and the basketball player must be in House 2 or House 3.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person with lilies can't be in the last house (House 3), and the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in the first house (House 1). So, the person with lilies must be in House 1 or House 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2 or House 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in House 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3 (since the soccer player is in House 3 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 2).

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4 has spaghetti.

2. The pianist lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has a pianist.

3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has a pianist and fried rice.

4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has a pianist, fried rice, and red.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if someone likes yellow in House 2, the person with stew is in House 1. If someone likes yellow in House 3, the person with stew is in House 2. If someone likes yellow in House 4, the person with stew is in House 3. If someone likes yellow in House 5, the person with stew is in House 4.

6. The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4 can't have green.

7. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - Since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist must be in House 1 or 2.

8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
   - If someone likes yellow in House 1, the person who likes white is in House 4. If someone likes yellow in House 2, the person who likes white is in House 5. If someone likes yellow in House 3, the person who likes white is in House 5. If someone likes yellow in House 4, the person who likes white is in House 1. If someone likes yellow in House 5, the person who likes white is in House 2.

9. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - We already know this, so House 3 has a pianist, fried rice, and red.

10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

12. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 3: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red
- House 4: Spaghetti, Not Green

Since the person who likes yellow can't be in House 5, and there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white, the only possible pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 5).

- If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 4.
- If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes white must be in House 5.

Since House 4 already has Spaghetti and can't be Green, the person who likes yellow can't be in House 1.

So, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 5.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 5: White

The person who had stew must be in House 1 (since they live directly left of the person who likes yellow in House 2).

- House 1: Stew, Yellow

The percussionist and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 2, but since the person in House 2 likes yellow, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the cellist in House 2.

- House 1: Stew, Yellow, Percussionist
- House 2: Yellow, Cellist

The person who had pizza must be in House 5 (since they live to the right of the person who likes yellow in House 2).

- House 5: White, Pizza

- House 4: Spaghetti, Green

The only person left is the saxophonist, who must be in House 5.

- House 5: White, Pizza, Saxophonist

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- House 3 has the tea drinker.

Now, let's place the other things step by step:

1. **House 3: Tea drinker**
   - This means the tea drinker is in House 3.

2. **Stew < Spaghetti**
   - Stew can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - If Stew is in House 3, Spaghetti must be in House 4.
   - If Stew is in House 2, Spaghetti can be in House 3 or 4.
   - If Stew is in House 1, Spaghetti can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

7. **Grilled cheese ≠ House 1**
   - Grilled cheese is not in House 1.

Let's test the possible positions for Stew and Spaghetti:
- If Stew is in House 2, then Spaghetti must be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Stew is in House 2, then Spaghetti must be in House 4 (since House 3 is the tea drinker).
  - This means Running shoes must be in House 1 (since Running shoes < Stew).

Now, let's check the other clues:
- **Sandals < Root beer**
  - Sandals can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Sandals is in House 1, then Root beer can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 2, then Root beer can be in House 3 or 4.

  - If Grilled cheese is in House 3, then Water must be in House 4.

- **High heels and Water are adjacent**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Grilled cheese ≠ House 1**

Let's test the possible positions for Grilled cheese and Water:
- If Grilled cheese is in House 2, then Water must be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Water is in House 3, then High heels must be in House 2 (but Grilled cheese is already in House 2, so this is not possible).
  - If Water is in House 4, then High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

- If Grilled cheese is in House 3, then Water must be in House 4.
  - This means High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
- **House 1: Running shoes, Sandals, Grilled cheese**
- **House 2: Stew, High heels**
- **House 3: Tea drinker, Water**
- **House 4: Spaghetti, Root beer**

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in **House 1**.

1. One person ate pizza, and the other ate fried rice.
2. One person loves science fiction books, and the other loves history books.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who loves science fiction books.

Now, let's figure out where the science fiction book lover lives.

- If the science fiction book lover lived in House 2 (the right house), then the person who ate fried rice would have to live in a house even further to the right, but there are no more houses to the right. That doesn't work.
- So, the science fiction book lover must live in House 1 (the left house). This way, the person who ate fried rice can live in House 2, which is to the right of House 1.

3. The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Pianist, owns horses, likes white.
- House 2: Root beer lover.

Since the person in House 1 owns horses, the person in House 2 must own the dog. The person in House 1 likes white, so the person in House 2 must like blue.

   - So, the percussionist must be in House 2 or 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Fried Rice, Guitarist (since the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist and the only left option is House 1)

1. **The person with the phone is in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has the phone.

2. **The person with running shoes is in the third house.**
   - So, House 3 has running shoes too.

3. **The person eating oranges is to the right of the person wearing boots.**
   - This means the person with boots can't be in House 4, and the person eating oranges can't be in House 1.

4. **The science fiction book fanatic and the person with running shoes are next to each other.**
   - Since the person with running shoes is in House 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 2 or House 4.

5. **The romance book lover is directly to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - If the science fiction book fanatic is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.
   - If the science fiction book fanatic is in House 4, the romance book lover must be in House 3, but House 3 already has the phone and running shoes, so that's not possible.
   - So, the science fiction book fanatic is in House 2, and the romance book lover is in House 1.

6. **The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges are next to each other.**
   - The person eating oranges can't be in House 1 (romance book lover) or House 3 (phone and running shoes), so they must be in House 2 or House 4.
   - If the person eating oranges is in House 2, the person eating grapes must be in House 1, but House 1 is the romance book lover, so that's not possible.
   - So, the person eating oranges is in House 4, and the person eating grapes is in House 3.

7. **The percussionist is in the fourth house.**
   - So, House 4 has the percussionist and the person eating oranges.

8. **The person eating kiwis is not in the first house.**
   - The person eating kiwis must be in House 2 or House 3.
   - House 3 already has grapes, so the person eating kiwis must be in House 2.

9. **The person with the radio is not in the second house.**
   - The person with the radio must be in House 1 or House 4.
   - House 4 already has the percussionist and the person eating oranges, so the person with the radio must be in House 1.

10. **The flutist is in the third house.**
    - So, House 3 has the phone, running shoes, grapes, and the flutist.

11. **The person with the gameboy is to the right of the flutist.**
    - The flutist is in House 3, so the person with the gameboy must be in House 4.

12. **The person with loafers is not in the first house.**
    - The person with loafers must be in House 2 or House 4.
    - House 4 already has the percussionist and the gameboy, so the person with loafers must be in House 2.

13. **There are two houses between the person with high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast.**
    - The only possible positions are House 1 and House 4.
    - Since House 4 already has the percussionist, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 4.

14. **The saxophonist is to the left of the person with boots.**
    - The person with boots must be in House 2 or House 3.
    - House 3 already has the flutist, so the person with boots must be in House 2.
    - The saxophonist must be in House 1.

So, the person eating oranges is in **House 4**.

The answer is:
(B) 4"
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Root Beer and Milk**: The root beer lover and the milk drinker live next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

2. **Pizza and Tea**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

3. **Root Beer and Grilled Cheese**: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. So, they could be in houses 1 and 4, or 4 and 1.

4. **Red and Yellow**: There is one house between the person who likes red and the person who likes yellow. So, they could be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4.

5. **Mango and Oranges**: There is one house between the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges. So, they could be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4.

6. **Pizza and Yellow**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

7. **Oranges and Apples**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

8. **Stew Not in 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the third house.

9. **Stew and Water**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

10. **White and Stew**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. So, if the stew eater is in house 1, the white lover could be in houses 2, 3, or 4; if the stew eater is in house 2, the white lover could be in houses 3 or 4; if the stew eater is in house 3, the white lover could be in house 4.

11. **Apples and Pizza**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. So, if the pizza eater is in house 1, the apple eater could be in houses 2, 3, or 4; if the pizza eater is in house 2, the apple eater could be in houses 3 or 4; if the pizza eater is in house 3, the apple eater could be in house 4.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The root beer lover and the milk drinker must be in houses 3 and 4 (because if they were in houses 1 and 2, it would conflict with the pizza and tea drinkers being in houses 2 and 3).
- The pizza eater and the tea drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The grilled cheese eater must be in house 1 (because the root beer lover is in house 3).
- The red and yellow lovers must be in houses 1 and 3 (because the yellow lover is in house 2).
- The mango and orange eaters must be in houses 1 and 3 (because the orange eater is in house 2).
- The orange eater is in house 2, and the apple eater is in house 3.
- The stew eater must be in house 1 (because the water drinker is in house 2).
- The white lover must be in house 4 (because the stew eater is in house 1).
- The apple eater must be in house 4 (because the pizza eater is in house 1).

So, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

The answer is: **(C) 4**."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **House 1 (Convertible)**:
   - The person in House 1 drives a convertible. (Clue 7)

2. **House 2 (SUV and History)**:
   - The person in House 2 owns an SUV and is a history book buff. (Clue 6)

6. **Sandals and Boots**:
   - The person in House 1 (convertible) must be wearing boots, and the person in House 2 (SUV and history) must be wearing sandals. (Clue 4 and Clue 9)

7. **Stew and Science Fiction**:
   - The person in House 3 (truck and running shoes) must have stew, and the person in House 4 (fantasy and high heels) must be the science fiction book fanatic. (Clue 1)

8. **Grilled Cheese and History**:
   - The person in House 2 (SUV and history) must have grilled cheese. (Clue 5)

9. **Pizza**:
   - The only remaining lunch option for the person in House 1 (convertible and boots) is pizza.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.** (Clue 5)
2. **The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.** (Clue 7)
   - So, the saxophonist and the mystery book reader are the same person in the fourth house.

3. **The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other.** (Clue 6)
   - Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in either the third or fifth house.

4. **The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.** (Clue 4)
   - This means the percussionist and the romance book lover are in adjacent houses, with the percussionist to the left.

5. **There is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader.** (Clue 3)
   - The mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so the percussionist must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

6. **The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.** (Clue 1)
   - The romance book lover is in the third house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

7. **There is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist.** (Clue 2)
   - The only houses left are the first and fifth. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the fifth house, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

So, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Percussionist
- **House 3:** Romance book lover, violinist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader, saxophonist
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast, guitarist

The violinist lives in the third house.

So, the answer is **(C) 3**."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.**
   - So, House 4 has a television.

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - So, House 2 has loafers.

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the phone is not in House 2.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since the person with loafers is in House 2, the person with boots must be in House 1.

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - This means the person with the radio and the person with sandals must be in houses that are two apart. The only possible pairs are (1, 3) and (2, 4).

Let's put this together:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers, Not Phone
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Television

Now, for the radio and sandals:
- If the person with the radio is in House 1, then the person with sandals must be in House 3.
- If the person with the radio is in House 3, then the person with sandals must be in House 1.

Since House 1 already has boots, the person with the radio must be in House 3, and the person with sandals must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Sandals
- House 2: Loafers, Not Phone
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

Now, we need to place the phone and the gameboy:
- The person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in House 1 or House 3.
- Since House 3 already has the radio, the phone must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Sandals, Phone
- House 2: Loafers, Not Phone
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

The only device left is the gameboy, which must be in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a gameboy lives is **2**.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Well, let's see. The clues say that the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. So, the answer is (B) 2. That's where the person with the high heels lives."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a little puzzle.

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2).
2. Each house has one person living in it.
3. One person likes history books, and the other likes mystery books.
4. One person is wearing loafers, and the other is wearing high heels.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. So, the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.
2. The person who likes mystery books doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes mystery books must live in the first house.

Since the person wearing loafers can't be in the first house, they must be in the second house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Running shoes and Gameboy next to each other.**
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with the gameboy are neighbors.

2. **Pizza lives directly left of sandals.**
   - The person who had pizza is next to the person wearing sandals, and the pizza person is on the left.

3. **Running shoes not in the third house.**

    - The person who had spaghetti is next to the person with the radio, and the spaghetti person is on the left.

Now, let's put this all together:

- From clue 4, tulips are directly left of pizza. So, if pizza is in house 2, tulips must be in house 1. If pizza is in house 3, tulips must be in house 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who owns horses. Since there are only two houses, the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals, and the person in House 2 must own horses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person in House 2 must like history books, and the person in House 1 must have eaten spaghetti.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

We have two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2). Each house has a person with different things:
- Different flowers: lilies and daffodils
- Different instruments: flute and saxophone
- Different cars: sedan and convertible

Now, let's look at the clues:
1. The person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
2. The flutist doesn't live in the first house.

From the first clue, if the person with the sedan is to the left of the person with the lilies, the person with the sedan must be in House 1, and the person with the lilies must be in House 2. That's because there's no house to the right of House 2.

From the second clue, the flutist can't be in House 1, so the flutist must be in House 2.

So, we know:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Lilies and Flutist

Since the flutist is in House 2 and has the lilies, the person in House 1 must have the daffodils and play the saxophone.

So, the person with the lilies lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live next to each other.**
   - This means if one is in house 1, the other must be in house 2, or if one is in house 2, the other must be in house 3.

2. **The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the violinist must be in house 1 or 2, and the flutist must be in house 2 or 3.

3. **There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.**
   - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3, and vice versa. But if the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

4. **There's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.**
   - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1. This fits with the flutist being in house 3, because the flutist is to the right of the violinist.

So, if we put it all together:
- The person eating kiwis is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 1.
- The flutist is in house 3.

Since the pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other, the pianist must be in house 1 or 3. But since the violinist is in house 1, the pianist must be in house 3.

But wait, we need to check if this fits all the clues:
- The pianist (house 3) and the person eating kiwis (house 2) are next to each other.
- The flutist (house 3) is to the right of the violinist (house 1).
- There's one house between the person eating grapes (house 1) and the person eating kiwis (house 2).

- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

So, if the percussionist is on the left, they must be in House 1. The person with the radio must be in House 2, because they are directly to the right of the percussionist.

Now, since there are only two houses and two devices, the person in House 1 must have the phone, because the person in House 2 already has the radio.

So, the person who has the phone lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.**
   - This means if the person who likes white is in house 1, the person with the sedan must be in house 3, or if the person who likes white is in house 3, the person with the sedan must be in house 1. They can't be next to each other.

3. **The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person with the sedan are next to each other, with the yellow person on the left.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The second house has a convertible, so it can't have the sedan.
- If the person who likes yellow is next to the person with the sedan, and the sedan can't be in the second house, the sedan must be in the third house.
- If the sedan is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Alright, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **House 1**: The person here is wearing running shoes.
2. **House 3**: The person here owns a sedan.
3. **House 3**: Can't be the dog owner.
4. **Sandals and Bird Keeper**: The person wearing sandals lives to the left of the bird keeper.

6. **House 4**: Can't be wearing high heels.
7. **Fish Enthusiast and SUV**: The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

- **House 3**: Sedan, not the dog owner, not the fish enthusiast.
- **House 4**: Bird keeper, not high heels.
- **House 5**: Not loafers, not the fish enthusiast.

Since the person in House 1 is wearing running shoes and not the dog owner, the dog owner must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 3 has a sedan, so the dog owner must be in House 2.

- **House 2**: Dog owner.

The person in House 2 must also be wearing sandals (since they live to the left of the bird keeper in House 4).

- **House 2**: Dog owner, sandals.

The person in House 4 is the bird keeper and can't be wearing high heels. The person in House 3 has a sedan and can't be the fish enthusiast. The fish enthusiast must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Fish enthusiast.

The person in House 5 can't be wearing loafers, so they must be wearing boots.

- **House 5**: Fish enthusiast, boots.

The person in House 2 is wearing sandals and high heels, and the person in House 3 has a sedan and a truck. So, the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels, and the person in House 3 must be driving a truck.

- **House 2**: Dog owner, sandals, high heels.
- **House 3**: Sedan, truck.

The person in House 1 can't be the dog owner, so they must be wearing running shoes and driving a minivan.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, minivan.

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the one who owns horses.

- **House 4**: Bird keeper, horses.

So, the person who owns horses lives in **House 4**.

The answer is: **(C) 4**."

   - **Second House:** Loafers, Grapes, Rose Bouquet.
   - **Third House:** Kiwis, Lilies, Fish Enthusiast.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The left one is number 1, and the right one is number 2. Each house has someone living in it, and each person has different stuff:

- One person has tulips, and the other has carnations.
- One person has a dog, and the other has horses.

The clue says that the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. 

Now, if the person with the carnations is to the left of the dog owner, they must be in the house on the left, which is number 1. If they were in house number 2, they wouldn't be to the left of the dog owner.

So, the person with the carnations must live in house number 1.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Water and High Heels:**

   - Since the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, the person in house 1 must be eating grapes.

3. **Tea and television:**
   - The tea drinker is to the left of the person with the television.
   - So, the person in house 1 is the tea drinker, and the person in house 2 has the television.

Now, let's put it all together:

"Alright, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the tea drinker.

2. **The violinist does not live in the third house.**

3. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.**
   - The violinist is in the second house, so the guitarist must be in the first or third house. But the first house is taken by the tea drinker, so the guitarist must be in the third house.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - The guitarist is in the third house, so the person who drinks water must be in the third house. This means the cellist must be in the first or second house. But the first house is the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in the second house.

4. **Television to the Left of Phone:**
   - The television has to be in a house with a lower number than the house with the phone.

5. **Grilled Cheese and Radio One House Apart:**

   - The grilled cheese has to be directly to the left of the spaghetti. So, if the grilled cheese is in house 1, the spaghetti is in house 2. If the grilled cheese is in house 2, the spaghetti is in house 3. If the grilled cheese is in house 3, the spaghetti is in house 4, but house 4 has pizza, so that's not possible.

8. **Radio Not in House 4:**
   - The radio can't be in house 4, so it has to be in one of the other houses.

Let's put it all together:

- **House 4: Pizza**
- **House 4: Not Radio**
- **House 4: Not Computer**

Since the gameboy and computer are next to each other and can't be in house 4, they must be in houses 3 and 5. The fried rice must be in house 1 (since it's one house apart from the gameboy).

- **House 1: Fried Rice**
- **House 3: Gameboy**
- **House 5: Computer**

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Horses

Since the person eating mangos can't be in House 3, they must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

- House 1: Oranges
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: Horses

The person who drives a convertible must be next to the person eating mangos, so the convertible driver must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 has horses, the convertible driver must be in House 2.

- House 1: Oranges
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible
- House 3: Horses

The truck driver must be directly left of the convertible driver, so the truck driver must be in House 1.

- House 1: Oranges, Truck
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible
- House 3: Horses

The bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper can't be in House 1, they must be in House 2 or House 3. House 3 has horses, so the bird keeper must be in House 2, and the dog owner must be in House 1.

- The history book buff is in house 4 (one house away from the mystery book reader).

Now, the percussionist:
- The percussionist is to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist can be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The guitarist is right next to the percussionist, so if the percussionist is in house 3, the guitarist is in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the mystery book reader).

So, the percussionist must be in house 4, and the guitarist is in house 3.

Now, the person who had stew:

- House 3 is taken by the guitarist, so the science fiction person is in house 2.

Now, the person who had pizza and the saxophonist:
- There are two houses between the pizza person and the saxophonist. If the pizza person is in house 1, the saxophonist is in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by the percussionist).
- If the pizza person is in house 5, the saxophonist is in house 2 (but house 2 is taken by the science fiction person).

So, the pizza person must be in house 1, and the saxophonist is in house 4.

Now, the person who had grilled cheese:
- The grilled cheese person is to the right of the mystery book reader, so the grilled cheese person is in house 4 or 5.
- House 4 is taken by the percussionist, so the grilled cheese person is in house 5.

Now, the person who had spaghetti:
- The spaghetti person can't be in house 3, so the spaghetti person is in house 1.

Now, the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy person is in house 1, and the flutist is in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Spaghetti, fantasy book enthusiast, saxophonist
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, flutist
- House 3: Guitarist

1. **The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist can't be in house 2, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the cellist must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff can't be in house 2, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the history book buff must be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the houses are next to each other, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, respectively, or vice versa.

- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover

Since the cellist and the history book buff are in house 1, and the mystery book reader and the cat lover are in house 2, we need to figure out who is the root beer lover and who is the guitarist. They have to be next to each other, so:

- House 1: Cellist, History book buff, Root beer lover
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Guitarist

So, the person in house 1 is the cellist, history book buff, and root beer lover. The person in house 2 is the mystery book reader, cat lover, and guitarist.

Now, let's put this together:

- **House 1:** Dog owner
- **House 2:** (Not the dog owner)
- **House 3:** (Not the dog owner)

Since the dog owner is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 2 or house 3. But house 2 is where the bird keeper lives (because the bird keeper can't be in house 3, and house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

- **House 1:** Dog owner
- **House 2:** Bird keeper
- **House 3:** (Not the dog owner, not the bird keeper)

The person with tulips must be in house 3, because they have to be to the right of the dog owner in house 1.

From clue 6, the banana eater and the dog owner are next to each other, with the banana eater on the left. Since House 1 has mangos, the banana eater can't be in House 1. So, the banana eater and the dog owner must be in Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

Let's try the first possibility:
- If the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3:
  - House 2: Banana
  - House 3: Dog owner (and not banana)
  - House 4: (No restrictions yet)

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 3 and 4. Since House 3 is the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 4 and the kiwi eater in House 3.

- The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the basketball player, so the fish enthusiast can't be in the first house.
- The dog owner and root beer lover are neighbors.

So, the bird keeper must be in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house. So, House 2 has boots.
2. The person wearing high heels lives right next to the dog owner. Since the person in House 2 has boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing high heels, and the person in House 3 must be the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. So, House 3 has a sedan and a dog.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives right next to the person wearing boots. Since the person in House 2 has boots, the person in House 1 must have an SUV.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house. So, House 1 has a cat, high heels, and an SUV.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: High heels, SUV, Cat
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sedan, Dog

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

So, the person wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - So, the person in House 3 drinks tea.

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in House 1 or House 2, and the person who likes blue is in House 2 or House 3.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - So, the person who likes milk and the person eating apples are in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 has carnations.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - So, the person in House 2 has tulips.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person wearing boots is in House 1 or House 2, and the person who likes green is in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 is wearing running shoes.

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the person eating oranges is in House 1 or House 2.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:**
  - Has carnations
  - Wears running shoes
  - Can't be the one who likes blue (because the person who likes blue is in House 2 or 3)
  - Can't be the one eating oranges (because the person eating oranges is in House 1 or 2, but not House 3)
  - So, the person in House 1 must be eating kiwis (since they can't be eating apples or oranges).

- **House 2:**
  - Has tulips
  - Wears boots
  - Can't be the one who likes blue (because the person who likes blue is in House 3)
  - Can't be the one eating oranges (because the person eating oranges is in House 1 or 2, but not House 3)
  - So, the person in House 2 must be eating apples (since they can't be eating kiwis or oranges).

- **House 3:**
  - Drinks tea
  - Likes blue
  - Can't be the one eating apples (because the person eating apples is in House 2)
  - Can't be the one eating oranges (because the person eating oranges is in House 1 or 2, but not House 3)
  - So, the person in House 3 must be eating kiwis (but we already know the person in House 1 is eating kiwis, so this is a mistake. Instead, the person in House 3 must be eating oranges).

So, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **The mystery book reader lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the mystery book reader.

2. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house.

3. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - The person in the second house (the history book buff) must have the television.

4. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - The person in the first house (the mystery book reader) can't have the computer because the computer must be to the right of the phone. So, the person in the first house must have the phone.
   - This means the person in the third house must have the computer.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mystery book reader, phone
- House 2: History book buff, television
- House 3: Computer

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, and they must live in the third house.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house number:
(C) 3"
"A: No

Well, you see, St. Vitus's Dance makes a person's movements all jumpy and uncontrollable. Ballet needs you to be real smooth and graceful, so someone with those jumpy movements wouldn't do too well in a ballet competition. They'd have a hard time keeping up with the steps and staying in line with the other dancers. So, the answer is no, they probably wouldn't win."
"A: No

Pigs can't talk like we do, so they can't use Pig Latin. It's a silly way of talking that only people can do. Pigs just oink and grunt, and that's how they talk to each other. So, it's not possible for pigs to use Pig Latin."
"Well, I ain't got much book learnin', but I do know Ringo Starr, he's one of them Beatles, right? I heard he don't eat no meat. So if pot roast is a meat dish, which I reckon it is, he'd probably avoid it.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"Well, let me think about this. The 1936 Summer Olympics, that was a big deal, right? They had a huge stadium for all those people. I heard it could fit a lot of folks, like over 100,000 people. Now, the Super Bowl, that's also a big event, but I don't think their stadiums are as big as that old Olympic one. So, if we're talking about fitting all those Super Bowl fans, I reckon the 1936 Olympic stadium would be just fine.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"A: (B) Yes

I reckon you can find brown rock fish in the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis. They got lots of different fish down there in the Caribbean!"
"A: Yes

Growing seedless cucumbers is good for someone who's scared of bugs. These cucumbers don't need as many bees or other insects to grow, so you'll see fewer of them in your garden. That means you can enjoy gardening without worrying as much about bugs."
"Well, let's see. Martin Luther, he wrote 95 of those things, right? Half a year, that's about 182 days. If he did one a day, he'd run out way before that. So, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"Well, I reckon the waltz is a lot safer than that slam dance. Waltz is like a fancy, smooth dance where you just glide around. But slam dance, that's more like a wild, rough thing where people bump into each other a lot. So, if you're asking which one is less likely to hurt you, it's gotta be the waltz.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny ain't good for makin' silverware. That penny is made of steel with a zinc coat, not silver. Silverware needs to be made from silver or something that looks like it, and this penny just ain't the right stuff."
"B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be really tough, if not impossible. I mean, Venus is super hot—like, way hotter than a pizza oven. It's so hot that anything that could be snow would just melt right away. Plus, the air there is super thick and heavy, and there's no snow or ice. So, you couldn't even try to snowboard there even if you wanted to."
"Oh, I see. Well, let me think about this. The Battle of Tours, that was a big fight a long time ago, right? From what I've heard, it was Charlemagne's grandpa, Charles Martel, who was the big hero there. He stopped the other army from moving further north. So, Charlemagne's dad, Pepin, wasn't the one who did that. 

So, the answer is (B) No."
"Well, I reckon the folks at Nissan's main office in Japan probably use chopsticks, 'cause that's what most people there use to eat. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"B) No

Hermes ain't the same as Vulcan. Hermes is more like the quick-footed messenger guy, and Vulcan is the one who works with fire and makes stuff. They do different things, so they're not the same."
"(B) Yes

I reckon Ariana Grande could be talked about in a presentation 'bout post-traumatic stress disorder. She went through somethin' real bad when that attack happened at her concert in Manchester. She's talked 'bout how it messed with her head and how she's tryin' to deal with it. So, her story could help folks understand what PTSD is like and how it affects people, even big stars."
"Well, let me think about this. Jack Black, he's the funny guy who acts in movies, right? And Bear McCreary, he's the one who makes music for TV shows and stuff. They do totally different things! So, it doesn't make sense for them to be competing for the same award. 

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

Cucumbers ain't all the same. Some are crunchy, some are soft, and they can feel different depending on if they're fresh or not. Even different types of cucumbers have their own feel to 'em."
"Well, I reckon it could be. ""Rick and Morty"" has some pretty heavy stuff in it, like drinking and other grown-up problems. If a kid's already dealing with that at home, it might not be the best thing for them to watch. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"A: No

Simon Cowell can't vote for the next Supreme Court judge. Only American citizens can vote, and even then, they don't get to vote for Supreme Court judges. It's the President who picks them, and the Senate has to say it's okay."
"A: No

Jack Dempsey was long gone before Conor McGregor even started fightin'. There's no way he could've seen McGregor's matches."
"Well, I ain't never heard of Amy Winehouse liking that movie. She passed away before it even came out, so she couldn't have been a fan. 

The answer is (B) No."
"A: (A) Yes

Euphoria is like feelin' really, really good, ya know? When folks take drugs that give 'em that feelin', they might want to keep gettin' that good feelin' over and over. That's how they can get hooked on the drugs. So, yeah, euphoria is tied up with drug addiction."
"Well, let me think about this. Apollo, he's a god, right? He's got all sorts of powers and stuff. D'Artagnan, he's just a human, no matter how good he is with a sword. So, if we're talking about all the Apollos against all the D'Artagnans, the gods would win, wouldn't they?

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"Well, I ain't no doctor, but I heard Bob Marley got sick with something that started on his toe. They say it wasn't from the sun, so putting on sunscreen wouldn't have helped him. So, the answer is (B) Yes. Sunscreen wouldn't have stopped what got him."
"Oh, I see. Well, let me think about this. The French Defence is when you play your pawn to e5 and then d5, right? But that doesn't really help if the other player is trying to checkmate you in just four moves. The four-move checkmate is when they put their queen and bishop in a position to attack your king really fast. 

So, to answer your question: 
(B) No, the French Defence doesn't stop the four-move checkmate. You gotta be careful and watch out for those quick attacks!"
"A: No

I wouldn't drink week-old chlorine water. That stuff is meant for cleaning, not drinking. It can make you really sick if you drink it. Better safe than sorry!"
"Well, I ain't no scientist, but I reckon a person who has trouble seeing some colors can still tell the difference between a light that's a bright red-orange and a gas that's a pale yellow-green. The colors are just too different, even if you can't see all the colors like most folks. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"(B) No

I reckon Elizabeth I probably didn't see that play. She was a big deal, and plays back then weren't always for the fancy folks like her. Plus, I don't think they'd just let anyone, even the queen, pop in to watch a play whenever they wanted. So, I'm guessing she didn't get to see ""Dido, Queen of Carthage."""
"A: Yes

I reckon you can stay away from those troublemakers on Reddit. Here’s what I think:

1. **Don’t Feed the Trolls**: Just ignore 'em. If they don’t get a reaction, they might leave you alone.
2. **Tell the Mods**: If someone’s being a real pain, let the moderators know. They can handle it.
3. **Block 'Em**: You can block users who are always causing trouble.
4. **Pick Your Spots**: Some subreddits are better than others. Stick to the ones where people are more friendly.
5. **Stay Cool**: Don’t let 'em get under your skin. Keep your cool and you won’t get sucked into their nonsense.

So yeah, you can avoid those trolls if you play it smart."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon sea turtles are doin' just fine with less folks around botherin' 'em. Less people means less noise and trash, so they probably got more peace and cleaner water. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"Well, I reckon Jesus wouldn't know nothin' 'bout the Easter Bunny. That's a new thing, way after His time. So, I'd say:

(B) No"
"Well, let's see. An elephant is huge, like, really, really big. A macaque is just a little monkey. So, if they got into a fight, the elephant would win easy. It's just common sense.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

Augustus wasn't his real name. He got that name later when he became a big deal. His real name was something else, like Gaius Octavius or something. But everyone called him Augustus when he was the boss of Rome."
"A: No

The folks in the Confederate states back before the Civil War spoke regular English, just like folks do now, not that old-timey English from way back when."
"A: Yeah, Robert Wadlow would definitely be way taller than a German Shepherd. He was super tall, like taller than most doors! So the answer is (A) Yes."
"A: No

Alcohol ain't good for ya, especially if you drink a lot of it. Jack Kerouac, he was a writer and he drank a lot, and that didn't do him no favors. It messed up his body and probably his mind too. So, no, it wasn't good for him."
"A: No

Blue ain't the most expensive color. There are other colors that can cost more, like some special reds or even certain greens. It all depends on what they're made from and how rare or hard to make they are. But blue isn't always the priciest."
"Well, let me think about this. Ryan Crouser, he's that big strong guy who throws those heavy metal balls, right? I've seen him on TV, and he's really strong. A bengal fox, that's a small animal, kind of like a dog but smaller. If Ryan Crouser can throw a heavy ball, he should be able to throw a little fox without much trouble, right?

So, I'd say:
(A) Yes"
"Well, let's think about this. Lord Voldemort, he was a big deal, right? He was all about pure blood and stuff. But he himself wasn't a pure-blood; he was a half-blood. So, if he was in charge, he wouldn't have made rules that would kick him out, would he? He'd probably make sure he could still be there, no matter what.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"Well, let me think about this. The Jackson 5, they were a big family group, right? There were five of them: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Michael. That's a lot of brothers and sisters!

The Isley Brothers, now, they were a bit smaller. I think there were three of them: O'Kelly, Rudolph, and Ronald. 

So, if we're talking about which one was bigger, the Jackson 5 had more people in the group.

So, the answer is (B) Yes. The Jackson 5 was a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers."
"A: No

You don't need no special bacteria to make pickles. You can just use vinegar and some spices, and that'll do the trick. Just put your cucumbers in a jar with some vinegar, salt, and your favorite spices, and you got yourself some pickles!"
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon the Wall Street Crash of 1929 must've hit a lot of companies hard, including them robotics firms. When the stock market crashes, it's like a big storm that affects everyone. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes

The crash probably hurt the stocks of robotics companies too."
"Oh, I see. Well, Moon Jae-in, he's from South Korea, right? So, he wasn't born in China or anywhere near that old place called Khanbaliq. So, the answer is (A) No."
"(B) Yes

People with anorexia are more likely to break a bone. They don't eat enough, which means their bones don't get the stuff they need to stay strong. Plus, their body doesn't work right because of the lack of food, and that can make their bones weaker. So, they're more at risk of getting hurt."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Them folks on the Oregon Trail were travelin' by wagon, not on no ship. They wouldn't be singin' sea shanties 'cause they weren't sailors. They probably had their own songs to keep their spirits up, but not them sea shanties."
"A: Yes

Shooting a bald eagle can get you in big trouble. They're protected birds, and hurting one can land you in jail for a long time, maybe even longer than Michael Vick was in for his dogfighting stuff."
"Well, let me think about this. Gandhi, he was a big leader in India, right? He passed away a long time ago, before they even had TVs in India. The show Bonanza, that came much later. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: No

Hornets are bugs that fly around on land. They don't go in the ocean, so they can't tell us anything about the sea. Ocean people need to look at the water and the fish to learn stuff, not at hornets."
"A: No

Wearin' sandals out there in the cold ain't gonna be comfy. It's freezin' at that base, and you gotta keep your feet warm and protected. Sandals just ain't made for that kinda weather."
"A: Yes

I reckon a grey seal can swim in the same water as that big whale from the story. They both live in the ocean, so they could end up in the same spot, right?"
"A: No

I don't think a Trek 9000 needs an anchor to park. You can just lean it against something or use a kickstand if it has one. Bikes don't need no fancy anchors to stay put."
"A: No

Hippos ain't just in Africa. Sure, they come from there, but you can see 'em in zoos all over the world. Some folks even brought 'em to other places, like in South America. So, no, they're not just in Africa."
"A: No

Earth Day is about takin' care of the planet, not makin' a mess. People plant trees, pick up trash, and learn ways to keep the Earth clean and healthy. A tire fire would just hurt the air and the ground, so that ain't somethin' folks do on Earth Day."
"Well, I ain't never heard of Buddy the Elf knowin' nobody in publishin'. So, I reckon the answer is:

(B) No"
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Leap years, they come every four years, right? And hamsters, they can live for a couple of years, sometimes even a bit more. So, if a hamster is born in a leap year, it could definitely see another leap year before it passes on. So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"Oh, no, Rahul Dravid ain't no cricket from the Gryllidae family. He's a famous cricket player from India! So the answer is (A) No."
"A: No

See, the 23rd Amendment, it's like a rule that lets folks in D.C. vote for the president. But that didn't change things for people in Puerto Rico. They still can't vote for president unless they move to one of the states. So, the answer is no."
"Well, I ain't no expert on NASCAR or nothin', but I reckon the answer is (B) No. This William Franklyn-Miller fella, he's an actor, ain't he? Don't think actors go around winnin' NASCAR races. That's a whole 'nother world, with all those fast cars and stuff. So, no way he could win a race like that."
"B: No

I reckon they wouldn't be friends. One was a big deal in the church way back when, and the other is a scientist who doesn't believe in God. They just seem too different, you know?"
"A: No

Hiding a pet macaque under your desk ain't a good idea. They're too big and active for that. Plus, it's not nice to the animal. They need space to move around and play."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon the answer is (B) No. Justin Bieber's a singer, not a politician. I don't see him taking over Mike Pence's job. That just don't make no sense!"
"A: No

I don't think people on YouTube get a lot of unsolicited audiobook advice. Most of the time, if someone talks about audiobooks, it's because the video is about books or someone asked about them in the comments. It's not like people are getting random suggestions all the time."
"A: (A) Yes

Yeah, they use metres in the UK. I know that 'cause I've seen it on signs and stuff, even though they sometimes use other funny old measurements too. But for most things, like in schools and shops, they use metres."
"Well, let me think about this. Goofy was made by someone who worked for Walt Disney. Walt Disney had a brother, but I don't know of anything bad that he did that would get him kicked out of church. So, I'd say:

(B) No"
"A: (A) Yes

Sure, there are mental problems that people can keep hidden. Some folks might look fine on the outside, but they're dealing with stuff like feeling really sad or worried all the time. They might not show it to others, but it's still there."
"A: Yes

Well, you see, Paul Bunyan is this big, strong fella from the old stories, right? He’s known for doing huge things like chopping down forests and digging rivers. Now, if you think about it, that kind of big, rough work ain’t really what you need when you’re trying to plan a city. Cities need careful planning, with roads and buildings and parks all fitting together just right. Paul Bunyan might accidentally knock down a whole neighborhood just by sneezing! So, he’d probably not be the best choice for an urban planner."
"A: Yes

I've seen parsley in different parts of the store. Sometimes it's in the fresh veggie area, and other times it's in the spice section all dried up. So yeah, it's normal to see it in more than one spot."
"Well, let me think about this. A football field is pretty big, right? It's like a really long and wide rectangle. Now, Alcatraz Island, that's the place where they used to keep all the bad guys, and it's not that big. But from what I've seen, it's bigger than a football field. So, if you just talkin' about space, yeah, you could probably fit a football field there. But it's not like you could just go and put one there 'cause the island is all rocky and stuff, and there's buildings and everything.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes, but it's not like you could actually do it 'cause of all the rocks and buildings."
"A: No

I don't think kaffir lime would be good in a White Russian. That drink is all about the smooth, creamy taste with the coffee and vodka. Kaffir lime is too strong and might mess up the flavor. Stick with the classic stuff for this one!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Even if a goblin shark had legs or arms, it's just not built to ride a bike. Sharks are made for swimming in the water, not for pedaling around on land. It'd be like trying to teach a fish to climb a tree!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. Even though Kurt Cobain ain't around no more, his music and the kind of sound he made with Nirvana sure didn't just disappear. People still listen to it, and new bands keep getting inspired by it. So, yeah, it's still alive and kickin'."
"B) No

A spice grinder ain't useless for them cheap cinnamon sticks. Sure, it might take a bit more effort, but if you break the sticks into smaller pieces, it should work just fine. You might have to grind for a bit longer, but you'll get your cinnamon powder in the end."
"A: No

A slingshot ain't no artillery. Artillery is big guns and stuff used in war, like cannons and rocket launchers. A slingshot is just a little thing you hold in your hand to shoot small rocks or marbles. It's not the same at all."
"A: No, you can't eat soup with your hands. It's too runny and you'd just make a big mess! Soup's gotta be eaten with a spoon or sipped from a bowl."
"A: No

Katy Perry, she's all about that pop music, you know? Not gospel. Most folks follow her for her big, catchy pop songs."
"Oh, I see. Well, the Capricorn symbol is like a goat with a fish tail, right? It's not the same as a chimera, which is a mix of a lion, a goat, and a snake. So, the answer is (B) No. Capricorn doesn't have all those parts."
"Well, let me think about this. The Eurovision Song Contest is a big singing competition where different countries send singers to compete. Dafne Keen is an actress, not a singer, and I don’t think she was in the contest. Plus, I heard that the contest didn’t even happen in 2020 because of all the trouble with the pandemic. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) Yes

I think Iris and Hermes would have a hard time at a UPS job. They're gods, sure, but they're used to flying around and delivering messages in a magical way. In a UPS job, they'd have to deal with heavy boxes, driving trucks, and all sorts of modern stuff they ain't used to. Plus, they'd have to follow a bunch of rules and work with other people, which might be tough for them. So, yeah, they'd probably struggle."
"A: No

Well, ya see, the Cookie Monster loves his cookies, and them cookies ain't exactly the kind of food that cavemen used to eat. The Paleo diet is all about eatin' stuff like meat, fish, fruits, and veggies—things that grow in the ground or run around. Cookies? They got flour and sugar and all that processed stuff. So, Cookie Monster's diet ain't Paleo friendly."
"Well, let's see. Pi, that's the number that's a bit more than 3, right? And the square root of 5, that's a bit more than 2. So, if pi is more than 3 and the square root of 5 is less than 3, then pi must be bigger.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"A: Yes

I've seen that pink ribbon thing around, especially in October. People wear it to show they care about folks with breast cancer. So, yeah, it's got a ribbon."
"(B) No

Having lactic acid in your body ain't bad. When you do a lot of exercise, your muscles make lactic acid. It can make your muscles feel sore and tired, but that's just your body working hard. It's normal and helps your body in its own way. So, don't worry about it!"
"A: No

The Gunpowder Plot didn't get rid of Mary, Queen of Scots' family line. They tried to blow up King James, who was Mary's son, but it didn't work. King James lived, and his family kept ruling. So, the answer is No."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, the folks in them Masonic Lodges, they got some strict rules. They usually only let grown-up men join. So, a young girl like Alice from that story wouldn't be allowed in."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon the crocodile bite hurts more. You see, crocs are known for their mighty jaws. They can chomp down with a force that's just unreal. So, if you had to pick between a bull shark and a croc, the croc's bite is gonna hurt worse.

So, the answer is (B) No."
"A: No

Snow White didn't really have a choice in a lot of what happened to her. The queen tried to hurt her without her knowing, and she ate the apple without knowing it was dangerous. That's not really fair or right. So, it's not a good example of consent."
"A: (A) Yes

Well, you see, the Avengers are from Marvel, and DC is a whole different thing. They got their own heroes like Superman and Batman. So, if a store is all about DC, putting Avengers stuff there would be like mixing apples and oranges. It just don’t fit right!"
"A: Yes

I've heard that some folks believe rhino horns can help with, uh, bedroom issues. Don't know if it's true, but it's caused a lot of trouble for those big animals. People hunt them for their horns, thinking it'll do something special. But it's just a belief, and it's putting the rhinos in danger."
"A: No

NFL players play football, not war. They train to run fast, throw balls, and tackle each other, not to use guns or fight in battles. So, they don't get that kind of military training."
"A: (A) Yes

I heard that Bruce Lee, the famous martial arts guy, didn't stick around for his graduation at the University of Washington. He left before he finished his studies to focus on his martial arts stuff. So, he wasn't there when they had the big graduation ceremony in 1964."
"A: No

I don't think a Zoroastrian would look to the Quran for guidance. They have their own holy books and teachings that they follow. The Quran is for Muslims, and Zoroastrians have their own special books."
"Well, I reckon Brooke Shields could do just fine at that fancy school, the University of Pennsylvania. She's smart and has shown she can work hard in her acting. If she puts her mind to it, I bet she can make it work.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"Well, I ain't no doctor, but I reckon a quarter is too big to fit inside a human kidney. Kidneys are them bean-shaped things in your back, and they ain't hollow like a water bottle. They're more like solid lumps that clean your blood. So, no way a quarter could fit in there.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"A: Yes

I reckon it would be a bit odd. Bruce Gandy is known for playing the organ, not for singing. The Messiah by Handel needs people who can sing really well, not just play instruments. So, it wouldn't make much sense to have him as a singer in that piece."
"A: No

Well, I ain't never seen a baby with a moustache, and I reckon that's 'cause they just don't grow 'em. Babies are smooth-faced little things, and any hair they got is usually on their heads or maybe some fine stuff you can barely see. So, nope, babies don't have moustaches."
"Well, I ain't no historian, but I'm pretty sure they didn't sit down with blueberry scones to sign the Treaty of Versailles. That sounds more like something you'd do at a coffee shop, not at a big important meeting. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: No

I reckon most folks go to the grocery store expectin' their meat to taste just like it always does. If it starts tastin' like somethin' wild, they might not be too happy 'bout it. People usually want what they're used to, ya know?"
"A: No

The people who started Skype are from Europe, not Asia. They're from countries called Sweden and Denmark. So, the right answer is (B) No."
"Well, I ain't never heard of no Sockington before, but if you're askin' me, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No

I don't know why, but I just got a feelin' that Sockington don't like onions."
"A: No

I ain't never seen no storks at a baby shower. They're just birds, and folks don't invite birds to parties. Baby showers are for people to bring gifts and celebrate the new baby, not for storks or any other animals."
"B) No

The Greek alphabet is a lot more common. You see it all the time, like in school or on signs. The Sumerian cuneiform is really old and not used anymore, so not many people know about it."
"A: No

Secretariat was a really fast horse, not a car racer. He won big races for horses, but he didn't race in Formula One, which is for cars. So, the answer is no."
"(B) Yes

A cattle farmer can be real useful to a drum maker. You see, drums need hides to make the top part that you hit to make sound. Cows have big, strong hides that are perfect for this. So, if a drum maker knows a cattle farmer, they can get these hides to make their drums. It's a good deal for both of them!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, ""beam me up"" is somethin' folks say when they're talkin' 'bout Star Trek, not Star Wars. In Star Wars, they got spaceships and lightsabers, but no one's gettin' beamed up like in that other show. So, Star Wars fans don't say it much."
"Well, I reckon it depends on where you are and who you're with. In some places, like churches or areas where lots of folks are Christian, it's totally fine to wear a crucifix. It's seen as a sign of your faith. But in other places, like schools or work, or in countries where not many people are Christian, it might not go over so well. Some folks might find it a bit odd or even offensive.

So, if I had to pick, I'd say:
(A) Yes, but you gotta be mindful of where you are and who you're around."
"(B) No

The Swiss Guard is like a special group of soldiers that protect the Pope in Vatican City. They don't have anything to do with making laws in Virginia. The people who make laws in Virginia are elected by the people who live there. So, the Swiss Guard can't just go and sit in those chairs."
"Well, I ain't no scientist, but I reckon the answer is (B) No. Placozoa, they're these tiny little critters, and from what I understand, they don't have brains or anything like that. So, they can't really have learning problems, can they?"
"B: Yes

I reckon Bart Simpson could have comics with The Joker. Kids like Bart, who are into comics, usually have all sorts of superhero stuff, and The Joker is a big deal in those comics. So, it makes sense that he could have some."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I heard 50 Cent and Jeffrey Atkins don't see eye to eye. They had some beef back in the day, and it got pretty heated. So, I reckon they don't get along.

(B) No"
"A: No

I don't think a celibate cleric would get stoned in Somalia. Celibacy means not having a wife or kids and not having sex, and that's not something people would stone someone for. They might not like it, but it's not a reason to hurt someone."
"Oh, I see. Well, the Riksdag is a big deal in Sweden, which is part of Scandinavia. It's like the main place where they make laws and decide important stuff for the country. So, to answer your question:

(B) Yes, the Riksdag is a political thing in Scandinavia."
"A: No

Spaghetti shouldn't be slick when it's cooked. It should be just right, not too soft and not too hard. You want it to have a little bit of a bite to it, so it's nice and tasty."
"Well, I've heard that Isaac Newton is often talked about with an apple. They say he was sitting under a tree and an apple fell on his head, and that's when he got the idea about gravity. So, I reckon the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"A: No

Look, I ain't no doctor or nothing, but getting hit on the head with somethin' as big and heavy as a jackfruit? That's just askin' for trouble. You could get a real bad bump or worse. Best to stay clear of that kinda thing."
"Well, if Christopher Reeve were poor, I reckon he might not have had the money to get all the fancy doctors and treatments he needed. Rich folks can afford the best care, you know. So, I think if he were poor, he probably wouldn't have lived.

(A) No"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Just because a president gets elected by everyone doesn't mean the mail carriers get a day off. They usually keep working unless it's a big holiday that the government says is a day off for everyone."
"A: No

Dyslexia ain't the most common intellectual disability. It's more like a problem with reading and writing, not the same as being intellectually disabled. The most common intellectual disability is something else, like Down syndrome."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, if Jackie Chan don't know how to use sign language or write to talk, he'd have a hard time chatthin' with someone who can't hear. It's like tryin' to talk to someone who speaks a whole different language!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, New York gets real cold in the winter, with lots of snow and ice. Down in Florida, it's much warmer, even in the winter. So, if you're out in the cold in New York, you're more likely to catch a bad chill, which can be real dangerous. In Florida, it's not as cold, so you're less likely to get that bad chill."
"Oh, no, he didn't. John Kerry is an American, and he didn't run in the UK election. So the answer is (B) No."
"A: Yes

I think binary numbers and the alphabet can make a strong password. If you mix them up, like using some 0s and 1s with letters, it can be really hard for someone to guess. For example, a password like `1A0b1C0d` is pretty tricky and long, which makes it strong. So, I'd say yes, they can make a good password."
"A: No

I reckon it's not likely you'd see a full circle rainbow while havin' lunch on the beach. You see, rainbows usually show up as a part of a big arc 'cause the ground gets in the way of seein' the whole thing. To spot a full circle rainbow, you'd need to be up high, like in a plane or on a tall mountain, lookin' down. On a beach, the ground and the sea would block the bottom part of the rainbow. So, it's best to enjoy the view and your lunch, but don't expect to see a full circle rainbow!"
"Oh, I see. Well, Abdulqawi Yusuf is a big important person, right? He works for a really important court in a place called The Hague. But I don't think he goes there every single day like you go to work. He probably has lots of other stuff to do, like meetings and stuff. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: No

Nancy Drew, the one played by Emma Roberts, ain't no private investigator. She's just a smart kid who likes to solve mysteries on her own. So, the right answer is (A) No."
"Well, let me think about this. Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and Gerald Ford was a Republican. They're from different parties, so they probably wouldn't agree on a lot of stuff. So, I'd say:

(A) No

They probably wouldn't be on the same side."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon if there's a big boom at a place where they keep gunpowder, it's gonna make a real loud and fast blast. That kind of explosion can shoot out so fast, it goes faster than sound. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"A: No

I ain't never heard of folks puttin' critters from the Black Sea on their pizza. Pizza usually has stuff like cheese, pepperoni, or maybe some veggies. Don't think no one's goin' out of their way to catch somethin' from the Black Sea just for that!"
"Well, let me think about this. Bill Nye, he's that science guy, right? And Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he was a president a long time ago. I reckon Bill Nye wasn't even born when Roosevelt was president, so he couldn't have voted for him.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"A: Yes

Canada's got a connection to the King over in England. The King's like the big boss, but they don't really run the country day to day. It's more of a tradition thing, you know?"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, folks who play guitar a lot, their fingers get used to the strings. It's like when you do a lot of work with your hands, they get tougher. Guitar players' fingers get harder and they don't feel the pain as much when they press the strings. So, they can play for a long time without their fingers hurting."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I heard about this guy Kami Rita. He's a real pro at climbing big mountains, like that huge one in Nepal, Mount Everest. Mount Emei, which is in China, is a lot smaller and not as tough. So, I reckon it wouldn't be too hard for him.

(A) No"
"Well, let me think about this. Sudoku is a game where you have to fill in numbers from 1 to 9 in a grid. Each row, column, and little box has to have all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any.

Now, Roman numerals are those fancy letters like I, V, X, and so on. They don't really match up with the numbers 1 to 9 in the same way. For example, 4 is IV, and 9 is IX. It would be really confusing to use those in Sudoku because you'd have to keep converting them back to regular numbers to make sure you're not repeating anything.

So, the answer is (B) No. Roman numerals can't be used to fill the Sudoku boxes."
"A: No

See, when it's daytime in one place, it's nighttime somewhere else. But that doesn't mean it's dark all the time in the other place. If it's daytime in Los Angeles, it's nighttime in Basel, but it's not dark in Basel during Los Angeles' daytime. It's just that it's nighttime there. So, the answer is no."
"A: No

I reckon it wouldn't make the news in 2020. Spirit, that Mars rover, stopped talking to us a long time ago, way back in 2010. If it suddenly started sending messages again after all those years, it would be a big surprise, but it just ain't likely to happen. So, no, it wouldn't be in the news."
"A: (B) Yes

Pancakes ain't good for cats. They got stuff in 'em that can make a cat's tummy hurt, like milk and sugar. Cats don't digest those things well. Plus, pancakes don't give 'em the nutrients they need. Stick to cat treats or some cooked chicken if you wanna give 'em a special snack."
"Oh, no, honey. Aretha Franklin was singing that soulful music way before Nine Inch Nails even started making their loud, rocky stuff. So the answer is (B) No."
"B) No

Jon Brower Minnoch was really, really heavy, not someone who didn't eat enough. So, he didn't have anorexia."
"A: No

I don't think H.G. Wells talked about cosmic rays in ""The War of the Worlds."" The story is about Martians coming to Earth and causing a lot of trouble, but I don't remember anything about cosmic rays. They had some fancy weapons and stuff, but not cosmic rays."
"A: No

You don't need different colored pens for Sudoku. It's just a game where you fill in numbers, so one pen is all you need. But if you want to make it look prettier or help you see things better, you can use different colors if you like. But it's not necessary."
"Oh, I see. Well, let me think about this. The big religions that say the Himalayas are special, like Hinduism and Buddhism, they've been around for a very long time, way before the 19th century. So, the answer is (B) No. These religions didn't start in the 19th century. They're much older than that!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, white rice is just grains, and it don't really go bad like that. It might get some bugs or get a bit stale, but it don't turn rancid. Sesame seeds, though, they got oils in 'em, and those oils can go bad and make the seeds taste yucky. So, the sesame seeds are more likely to go bad first."
"A: No

Penicillin is for getting rid of infections, like when you have a bad cut or a really bad cold. It doesn't help with learning problems. Those are different and need different kinds of help, like special teachers or extra practice."
"A: (A) Yes

I've heard that some kinds of cancer can make your body produce too much of that fight-or-flight stuff, like adrenaline. It's not common, but it can happen with certain tumors. So, yeah, it's possible."
"A: No

Grizzly bears ain't found where Vellore Fort is. They're big animals from places far away, like North America. So, the folks at Vellore Fort didn't have to worry 'bout grizzly bears."
"A: No, the brain ain't in the torso. It's up in your head, inside the skull."
"Well, let's think about this. If you watch 10 hours of Netflix shows every day, it depends on how good the picture looks, right? If it's just regular TV quality, it takes up less space. If it's super clear, like on a big fancy TV, it takes up more space.

A 500GB USB is pretty big. For regular TV shows, you could probably fit a lot of hours. Even for really clear shows, you could still fit a good amount.

So, if you're watching regular or even pretty clear shows, a 500GB USB should be enough for 10 hours a day for quite a while.

The answer is (B) Yes."
"Well, let's see. I heard about this guy, Jon Brower Minnoch, who was really, really heavy. They say he weighed about 1,400 pounds at his heaviest. That's a lot, right?

Now, there's this space thing called Voyager 2. It's a big machine that went to space. When they sent it up, it weighed around 1,800 pounds.

So, if we're talking about who's heavier, Jon Brower Minnoch or Voyager 2, Voyager 2 is the heavier one.

So, the answer is:
(B) No

Jon Brower Minnoch wouldn't break a chair before Voyager 2's weight. Voyager 2 is heavier!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Hedgehogs don't really think about whether other critters have backbones or not. They just go about their business, looking for food and staying safe. If something's small and looks tasty, they might eat it, whether it's got a backbone or not. And if something's big and scary, they'll probably try to avoid it. So, no, they wouldn't avoid spineless animals just because they don't have backbones."
"A: No

The iPhone didn't start the scientific revolution. The scientific revolution happened a long, long time ago, way before phones or computers were even a thing. It was all about smart people like Galileo and Newton figuring out how the world works. The iPhone is just a fancy phone that came much later and made it easier for people to use the internet and do lots of cool stuff on their phones."
"A: No

Handedness don't really change how you use American Sign Language. Whether you're right-handed or left-handed, you can still sign just fine. Most people just use their dominant hand, but it's not a big deal if you switch hands sometimes. The important thing is that you can communicate clearly."
"A: No

Buyin' food for a cat ain't unnecessary. If ya got a cat, ya gotta feed 'em. Cats need food to stay healthy and happy, just like how we need to eat. So, no, it's not unnecessary."
"A: No

Garfield's a cat, and cats don't eat dog food. They like their own special cat food, and Garfield especially loves lasagna! So, he wouldn't go for dog food."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, silicon rings are real popular these days. They're comfy, don't break easy, and you can wear 'em even if you're doing rough work. Bromine, on the other hand, I ain't never heard of anyone makin' rings out of that. It's some kind of chemical stuff that's not good for wearin'. So, silicon rings gotta be sellin' way better."
"A: (A) Yes

Sure thing! When folks talk 'bout the YMCA, it's pretty normal for 'em to start singin' that catchy tune. You know, the one that goes ""Y-M-C-A, it's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A."" It's just one of those songs that gets stuck in your head, and lots of people know it. So, yeah, it's totally normal!"
"Oh, I see. Well, if we're talkin' 'bout the worst plane crash ever, that was the one in Tenerife, Spain. But that wasn't United Airlines, it was KLM and Pan Am. So, United Airlines wasn't to blame for that one.

But if you're askin' about a different crash, I'd need to know which one. For the Tenerife crash, United Airlines was blameless.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"A: No

The Liberty Bell ain't where it started. It used to be up in the old State House, but now it's got its own place nearby. They moved it to keep it safe and let more folks see it."
"A: No

Well, you see, buddy, you can't just swap out them bowling pins for Dustin Hoffman's Oscars. Those Oscars are big, heavy, and fancy. They ain't gonna fit right, and they might get all scratched up or broken. Plus, they're worth a lot of money, and nobody's gonna want to risk losing 'em in a game of bowling. So, no, that just wouldn't work."
"A: No

Beavers got them big front teeth for chewin' on wood and stuff, but they ain't nothin' like them big, sharp teeth on a Smilodon. Those saber-toothed cats had teeth that were way longer and meant for huntin' and takin' down prey. So, no, a beaver's teeth don't come close to matchin' a Smilodon's."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, rivers are like the lifeblood of the land. They give water to the plants, and when they flood, they leave behind rich, good soil that helps crops grow better. Back in the old days, people figured out that if they settled near rivers, they could grow more food and have a better life. So, yeah, rivers played a big part in helping people start farming."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but from what I see, it seems like art ain't always a big priority in schools around here. Some places might have good art programs, but a lot of schools focus more on stuff like math and reading. So, if I had to pick, I'd say:

(B) No

Art's important, but it don't always get the attention it deserves in schools."
"Oh, I see. Well, Kurt Cobain, he was the guy from Nirvana, right? The one who played that guitar and sang those sad songs. He passed away a long time ago, and it was really sad. But I don't think some guy named Daniel LeFever had anything to do with it. Kurt had his own problems, you know? So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: No

Well, I reckon a two-year-old ain't got a chance in a Scrabble tournament. They're just little things, still learning to talk and all. Scrabble's a game for big folks who know lots of words and how to play smart. A toddler wouldn't stand a chance against grown-ups who've been playing for years."
"Well, I reckon Harry Potter could book a flight on Asiana Airlines if he wanted to. He's a wizard and all, but he can do normal stuff too, right? So, the answer would be:

(B) Yes"
"Well, let me think about this. Steven Spielberg, he's that famous movie director, right? He's been around for a long time. When he was a kid, we didn't have all this fancy technology like computers and the internet. So, I reckon he couldn't have sent emails back then.

(B) No"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Dr. Seuss, that's Theodor Geisel, became famous 'cause of his funny books and silly drawings, not 'cause of the color green. Sure, he used green in some of his stories, but it was his imagination and the way he wrote that made kids and grown-ups love his books."
"Well, I heard that the big lighthouse in Alexandria was built by some smart Greek folks. They were the ones who figured out how to make it so tall and strong. So, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: (B) Yes

I heard that Keith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, played a boat captain in a movie. He was in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" and he was some kind of pirate captain named Captain Teague. Don't ask me how I know this stuff, I just do!"
"A: Yes

Preventive healthcare can help stop STIs from spreading. Things like using condoms, getting checked regularly, and getting shots if they have them for certain STIs can all make a big difference. If people know how to stay safe and get help when they need it, it can really cut down on how many folks get sick."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but from what I've heard, the story of Jesus wasn't really inspired by Egyptian myths. Sure, some folks say there are some similarities, like how both Jesus and Horus had special births and did miracles, but most people who know a lot about this stuff say those stories are different in a lot of ways. So, I'd go with:

(B) No"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, Methuselah is from way back in the old stories, before the time we count as the Common Era. So, he couldn't hold a record in our time, 'cause he lived long before it all started."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (A) Yes. People from different places can talk to each other, even if they speak different languages. They can use translators or find someone who knows both languages to help them out. So, folks from Burundi and New Brunswick can definitely chat if they want to!"
"Well, if a pacifist is someone who doesn't believe in hurting or killing others, then they probably wouldn't like hunting. Hunting means killing animals, and that goes against what a pacifist believes in. So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (A) No. I don't think the American flag's stripes are something they just hand out, even to folks who do voices for famous cartoon characters. That flag is pretty special, you know?"
"A: No

SnapCap ain't no place where you go to buy stuff like at a mall or a grocery store. It's more like a place that gives money to small business owners who need a little extra cash to keep their businesses running. So, it's not a retail store."
"Well, I ain't never been to them fancy places, but I reckon the answer is (B) No. The Statue of Liberty is way over in New York, and that other one, the Statue of Freedom, is all the way down in Washington, D.C. They're too far apart for you to see one from the other, even if you had the sharpest eyes in the world."
"Well, I ain't sure who this Jason fella is, but if he's into the same kinda stuff as Dr. Disrespect, like playin' video games and makin' funny videos, then they might have somethin' in common. But if Jason's doin' somethin' totally different, then they probably don't.

So, if I had to guess, I'd say:
(A) No
(B) Yes

I'd need to know more about Jason to be sure, but I'll go with (B) Yes, just in case they both like the same kinda stuff."
"(B) No

Even if someone can't hear, they can still enjoy music in their own way. They can feel the vibrations and the beat, and some folks even watch music videos or see people sign the songs. So, deaf people aren't left out of enjoying music. They just experience it differently!"
"A: Yes

I reckon that's right. Humans ain't been to Mars yet, so there can't be no footprints on that mountain over there. All we got up there are them robots takin' pictures and stuff."
"A: No

I mean, think about it, Lionel Richie is a singer, right? And Abraham Lincoln, he was the president way back when. They didn't live at the same time, so there's no way they could've had dinner together."
"A: (A) Yes

Honey is linked to queens 'cause in a beehive, the queen bee is the boss, and all the worker bees make honey for her. Plus, honey is sweet and fancy, like how we think of queens."
"A: No

The Eiffel Tower wasn't around during the French Revolution. It was built way after that, for a big fair in Paris. The French Revolution happened a long time before the tower was even thought of. So, it can't be a symbol of the French Revolution."
"Well, let's think about this. The biggest bone in your body is in your leg, and the tiniest one is in your ear. Neither of these bones is in your torso, which is the middle part of your body. So, if someone hits you in the torso, these bones won't protect you.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"B: Yes

I reckon Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu would've eaten börek. It's a common Turkish food, and he lived in a place where people ate it all the time. So, he probably had some too."
"Well, let me think about this. King Kong was climbing that big building in New York, right? That's the Empire State Building, and it's really tall. The Eiffel Tower in Paris is also super tall, but I think the Empire State Building is taller. So, if King Kong was climbing the Empire State Building, he was probably higher up than where people can go on the Eiffel Tower.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"A: No, dessert ain't usually eaten before breakfast. You have your breakfast first thing in the mornin', and dessert comes way later, after your big meals like lunch or dinner."
"Oh, I see. Well, I ain't no expert, but I think the answer is:

(A) No

I don't think Disney's second film was a rip-off of a prophet story. It was just a fun story about a wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy. Doesn't sound like it has anything to do with prophets to me."
"A: No

I don't know much about science, but I do know that mercury is just a metal. It doesn't help catch the coronavirus or anything like that. The doctors and scientists use special tests to find out if someone has the virus."
"Well, let me think about this. Alec Baldwin, he's got a few kids, right? I heard he's got five. Now, Clint Eastwood, he's been around a long time, and I think he's got more than that. I believe Clint has seven kids. So, to answer your question:

(B) No

Alec Baldwin doesn't have more kids than Clint Eastwood. Clint has more."
"B) Yes

I heard that the word ""swastika"" comes from an old language called Sanskrit. They say it means something like ""good fortune"" or ""well-being."" It's a word that's been used for a long time in places like India, where it's seen as a lucky symbol."
"Well, let me think about this. The Genie in Aladdin, that was Robin Williams, right? I heard he's not with us anymore. So, I guess the answer is:

(A) No"
"A: (A) Yes

Karl Marx, he's the guy who wrote about how workers should own the things they make and how there shouldn't be rich and poor. The Communist Party of China, they follow his ideas. They believe in what he said about making sure everyone has enough and no one is too rich or too poor. So, yeah, Marx had a big impact on them."
"A: Yes

Spaghetti's usually made from wheat, and that's got something called gluten in it. People with celiac, they gotta stay away from gluten 'cause it makes 'em really sick. So, yeah, they should avoid spaghetti. But there's special kinds of spaghetti made without that stuff, and they can eat those."
"Well, let me think about this. Michael Bloomberg is super rich, right? Like, he's got more money than most people can even imagine. Micronesia, on the other hand, is a small country with not a lot of money. 

If we're talking about whether Michael Bloomberg could pay off Micronesia's debt for 10 years, I reckon he could. He's got so much money that it wouldn't be a big deal for him. So, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"(B) Yes

Sure thing! The Powerpuff Girls' names all start with ""B,"" so they're alliterative. That means they all have the same first letter, making it sound catchy!"
"A: No

Well, you see, a dosa is like a big, flat pancake made from rice and lentils. It's got a lot of carbs, which is not good for someone on a keto diet. Keto is all about eating less carbs and more fat. So, if you're on keto, you'd probably want to avoid dosa. But there might be some special ways to make it with different stuff, but the regular dosa? No, that wouldn't work."
"A: No

Andy Warhol didn't have anything to do with Art Deco. He came much later and did his own kind of art, with stuff like soup cans and famous people. Art Deco was all about fancy designs and shiny things, and that was way before Warhol's time."
"(B) Yes

In Mumbai, people do call it eggplant, but they also use the word ""brinjal."" So, yeah, eggplant is right."
"Well, let me think about this. Mount Fuji is a really tall mountain, right? I've heard it's super high, like taller than a bunch of skyscrapers stacked on top of each other. Now, the Sea of Japan is deep, but I don't think it's deeper than Mount Fuji is tall. So, if you put Mount Fuji in the Sea of Japan, the top would definitely stick out of the water.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, a chess board and a Shogi board are both just boards with squares, right? If you got a chess board, you could probably draw some extra lines to make it look like a Shogi board. Shogi just needs a bit more space, so you'd have to add an extra row and column. It's like drawing a bigger grid on a piece of paper. So, if you're crafty enough, you can turn a chess board into a Shogi board!"
"A: Yes

If an anxious person got some courage from the Wizard of Oz, it could help them feel better. Just like in the story, when the Cowardly Lion got his medal, it made him feel braver. So, if someone who's anxious gets a little boost of courage, it might help them face their worries more easily."
"Well, I ain't got no fancy education, but I reckon Steve Martin probably wouldn't turn down a plate of shrimp pasta. He seems like a guy who'd enjoy a good meal. So, I'd say:

(B) No"
"A: No

Cape Town is way down in South Africa, which is below the Equator. So, it's not south of the Equator, it's already in the southern part of the world."
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. If a baby was born on a leap year, which is February 29, 1996, they'd only have a real birthday every four years. So, in 2000, they'd only have had one real birthday. But that doesn't mean they're only 1 year old. They'd actually be 4 years old, 'cause four years have passed. So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"A: No

Kobe's famous meat is beef, but a BLT is made with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. So, it don't use Kobe beef."
"Well, let me think about this. Clark Gable, he was a big movie star, and I heard he was married a bunch of times. Richard Burton, he was married to Elizabeth Taylor twice, but that's still just two marriages, right? So, if I remember right, Clark Gable was married more times than Richard Burton.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"(B) Yes

It'd be pretty weird to see frost in September in Texas. That's way too early for that kind of cold weather. We usually don't see frost until much later, like in November or December. September is still pretty warm around here."
"Well, I reckon Mickey Mouse is a pretty famous fella, and if he's lookin' for some cool, custom stuff, he might just go to a place like Zazzle. They got all sorts of neat things there, so I don't think it's unlikely at all.

So, my answer is:
(A) No"
"A: Yes

I reckon some of the animals in the Chinese calendar are part of that fancy group called Chordata. I ain't no expert, but I know that rats, rabbits, horses, and pigs are all animals with backbones, which means they fit in that group. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, around Halloween, them big storms and hurricanes are still kickin' around in the Gulf of Mexico. It's like playin' with fire to go cruisin' then. The folks who run the cruises might try to steer clear of trouble, but you can never be sure. So, it's best to be cautious and not count on it bein' safe."
"A: No

I don't think Phileas Fogg's trip around the world would be harder just because of Pope John Paul I. The Pope being in charge doesn't really affect how you travel, you know? It's more about having the right boat, train, and maybe even an elephant to get you where you need to go!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. The Spice Girls, they're a bunch of singers, right? They make music and do shows. ŽRK Kumanovo, I heard, is a handball team. They play sports. So, these two groups can't really go head-to-head 'cause they do totally different things."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I heard that cookin' carrots makes the good stuff in 'em easier for your body to use. So, if you want to get the most out of your carrots, you should cook 'em. 

So, the answer is (B) No. Raw carrots ain't the best for gettin' the most vitamin A."
"A: No

You don't need to be in eleventh grade to get a driver's license. You just gotta be the right age and pass the tests."
"A: No

Iggy Pop ain't named after his dad. He picked that name 'cause he liked how it sounded, not 'cause of his old man."
"Well, I reckon it depends on what she likes or if she can't have regular milk. If she's got a reason to use something else, like if she's vegan or can't drink milk, then she might use a milk substitute. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes, if she has a reason to use something else."
"A: No

Olive oil ain't gonna do nothin' 'bout rabies. If you get bit by a critter that might have rabies, you gotta go see a doc right away. They'll give you shots to keep you from gettin' sick. Don't mess around with home remedies for somethin' as serious as rabies."
"A: No, chinchillas ain't cold-blooded. They're warm-blooded, just like us humans. They keep their body warm all by themselves, no matter if it's hot or cold outside."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (A) No. You see, Eskimos live way up north where it's super cold and there's not much sun to bask in. They're more worried about staying warm than sunbathing!"
"A: No

I don't know much about bombs or science, but I do know that onions are just for cooking. They can make you cry when you cut them, but they can't make a big boom like a bomb. So, onions can't help make a thermonuclear bomb."
"B) No

I reckon the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wouldn't go for that trickle-down stuff. They believed in spreading wealth around more evenly, not waiting for the rich to pass it down. They wanted the government to control things and make sure everyone got what they needed. So, they'd say no to letting the rich get richer and hoping it helps everyone else."
"Well, let me think about this. To be the president, you gotta be pretty old, right? I mean, not like a grandpa, but definitely not a kid. I think you gotta be at least 35 years old to even think about running for president. So, if someone is in eleventh grade, they're probably more like 16 or 17, which is way too young. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes

They wouldn't be able to run for president."
"A: No

I don't think there's a Marvel bad guy named after a citrus fruit. Marvel has lots of funny names, but I ain't heard of one that's called Orange or Lemon or anything like that."
"Well, let me think about this. A military division is a big group of soldiers, right? I heard it usually has around 10,000 to 20,000 people. Now, Ashland, Oregon, in 2018, had about 21,000 people living there. So, if we're talking about using the whole town to make a military division, it seems like it could work, even if it's just a little bit more than what they usually need.

So, I'd say:
(A) No, the population is not inadequate to be a hypothetical military division."
"Oh, yeah, Disney's got a big presence in Los Angeles County. They have their main offices in Burbank, which is right there in the county. So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: Yes

Christopher Columbus was from Italy, but he sailed for Spain. The Spanish king and queen gave him the ships and money to go find a new way to get to Asia, but instead, he found America. So, he was working for Spain, not his home country."
"A: (B) Yes

Ropes are really important on a frigate. You need them for all sorts of things, like tying up to a dock, lowering the anchor, and even controlling the sails if it’s an old-style ship. So yeah, you gotta have ropes!"
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon the Library of Alexandria would need less space than the Library of Congress. The Library of Alexandria was a big deal back in the day, but it's nothing compared to what the Library of Congress has now. The Library of Congress has millions and millions of books and all sorts of stuff. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"A: Yes

Paratroopers are trained to jump from planes and land in all sorts of places, so they can probably handle mountains too. They're used to tough situations, so they'd be good at helping people in need up there."
"B: Yes

I reckon Quiet wouldn't be a good fit for teachin' at that fancy school. She's a real quiet one, and teachin' needs someone who can talk and explain stuff. Plus, she's all about fightin' and spyin', not about business and all that. So, she'd probably not do so well in a classroom."
"Well, let me think about this. Watermelons need warm weather and lots of sun to grow, right? Brazil is a big country with lots of sunshine and warm weather, perfect for growing watermelons. Antarctica, on the other hand, is super cold and icy all year round. I don’t think anything grows there except maybe some tough little plants. So, it makes sense that Brazil would have way more watermelons than Antarctica.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

I don't think SNL would be the reason why Jenny McCarthy doesn't get along with her cousin. SNL is just a TV show, and it doesn't usually cause family problems. Family issues are usually about personal stuff, not about being on TV."
"A: Yes

If there were no loggers, it would be really hard to get toilet paper. You see, toilet paper comes from trees, and loggers are the ones who cut down the trees. Without them, we wouldn't have the wood to make the paper. So, we'd probably have a tough time finding toilet paper."
"Well, let me think about this. A silverfish is a tiny bug, right? It's pretty small and usually found in damp places like basements. The Empire State Building is super tall—like, way up in the sky tall. I don't think a little bug like that could climb all the way up there. It's just too high and there are probably lots of things that would stop it, like wind and all the windows and stuff.

So, my answer is:
(B) No"
"A: No

Well, I reckon you couldn't really use an armadillo as a shield. Sure, they got that tough shell, but it ain't made for stoppin' arrows or bullets or nothin' like that. Plus, it's just not right to use a livin' critter like that. They're small and could get real scared or hurt. Best to leave 'em be and find somethin' else for protection."
"Well, I reckon Siri must know some stuff 'bout shapes and sizes, like triangles and circles. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Largemouth bass, they're fish that folks usually catch in places like North America. The Canary Islands, they're way over in the Atlantic, and I don't think those fish are found there. If you want to catch largemouth bass, you'd probably have to go to a different place where they live naturally."
"A: No

Well, I ain't never heard of no sloth blowin' up just 'cause it ain't hangin' upside down. That sounds like one of them tall tales to me. Sloths, they just like to take it easy, hangin' from trees, but they ain't gonna go boom or nothin' if they're sittin' upright or even layin' down."
"B: No

Well, you see, watchin' all that EastEnders at once is just not a good idea. It's a lot of shows, and you gotta take care of yourself. You need to drink water and take breaks, or you might get real thirsty and tired. So, no, you can't do it without water."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. You see, these big seals, they need lots of space to swim and play, just like how we need room to run around. In a place like Sea World, they might not get all that space. Plus, they eat different stuff in the wild, like fish and penguins, and it's hard to give them exactly what they need in a tank. So, it can make them feel sad and not so healthy."
"A: No

I don't think a Polish poet wrote sonnets about the Islamic religion. I haven't heard of anything like that."
"Well, let me think about this. ""Coast to Coast AM"" has been on the air for a really long time, like since way back in 1989. It's still going strong today. The ""Rush Limbaugh Show"" started a bit earlier, in 1988, but it stopped when Rush passed away in 2021. So, ""Coast to Coast AM"" has been around longer.

(B) Yes"
"A: Yes

The pound sterling is valuable. It's the money they use in England, and it's worth a lot. People all over the world respect it, and it's used in big business deals. So, it's definitely valuable."
"A: No, the Forbidden City don't have no wooden rollercoaster. It's a place with lots of old buildings and history, not for rides."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon Felicity Huffman, she's one of them Hollywood types, right? And from what I hear, most of them lean left. Mike DeWine, he's a Republican, so I don't think she'd be too keen on voting for him. So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"B) No

I don't think people in Korea watched a lot of Iron Chef when they were under Japanese rule. That show came way later, and back then, they didn't even have TVs!"
"A: No

I don't think a thousand dollars per episode makes ""Days of Our Lives"" better than other soaps. People watch shows because they like the stories and the actors, not because of how much the actors get paid."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, them black-tailed jackrabbits and European wildcats don't live in the same places. So, the jackrabbits ain't gonna be scared of somethin' they never see. Makes sense, right?"
"A: No, people ain't banned from goin' into the Forbidden City. It's a big tourist spot now, and lots of folks visit it every day. You just gotta buy a ticket and follow the rules, like not touchin' stuff and bein' respectful. So, the right answer is (A) No."
"A: (A) Yes

Some folks, especially Native Americans, see Thanksgiving as a sad day 'cause it reminds them of the hard times their ancestors went through when the settlers came. So, while many people celebrate, others might use the day to remember and mourn."
"A: Yes

England, or the United Kingdom, was involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict. They were in charge of the area called Palestine after World War I. They had to deal with a lot of fighting between the Arabs and the Jews. The British tried to make rules to keep the peace, but it didn't work out. In the end, they left the area in 1948, and that's when Israel became a country. So, England was definitely part of what happened there."
"Well, I ain't never seen no one drown in a ballet show. They dance on a stage, not in a lake or nothin'. So, the answer is (B) No. You can't drown in a Swan Lake performance."
"A: (B) Yes

Well, I ain't never seen it myself, but I reckon if someone puts their mind to it, they could make furniture outta just about anything, even hair. I've heard tell of folks using all sorts of weird stuff to make things, so why not hair? It might be a bit strange, but if it's done right, it could be pretty neat, I suppose."
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Tony Bennett, he's a famous singer, right? His full name is Anthony Dominick Benedetto. Now, I ain't too familiar with all the UFC champions, but I don't recall any of 'em havin' the middle name Dominick. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"Oh, I see. Well, in the Kingdom of Hungary, the land owners didn't get to pick who the king was. The king was usually born into the job, like in a family business. So, the answer is (B) No."
"Well, if Goofy was a real dog and not just a cartoon, he'd need to take his heartworm medicine just like any other dog. Dogs can get sick from little bugs that mosquitoes carry, so they need to take special medicine to stay healthy. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"Oh, no, sweetie. They didn't have them fancy little stick things back when The Godfather was made. That movie is old, from way back in the '70s, and they used big, clunky stuff for their gadgets. So the answer is (B) No."
"A: No

Blue lips ain't normal. If your lips turn blue, it could mean somethin' is wrong, like you might not be gettin' enough air. Best to see a doc if that happens."
"Well, I ain't too sure about all the fancy stuff, but I do know that All Nippon Airways' main office is in a part of Tokyo called Minato. That place ain't close to no beach, it's more in the middle of the city where all the tall buildings are. So, the answer would be:

(B) No"
"Oh, I see. Well, the right answer is (B) No. The Eighth Amendment don't have nothing to do with talking freely or saying what you want. That's a different part of the Constitution, the First Amendment. The Eighth Amendment is more about making sure people aren't treated too harshly by the law, like not having to pay way too much money to get out of jail or not being punished in really mean ways. But it ain't about free speech."
"(A) No

Well, let me think about this. A tandem bike is something you ride on the road, right? It's got three seats for three people. But the Apollo 15 crew, they were astronauts! They went all the way to the Moon. The Moon is a whole different world with no air and lots of rocks. A bike just wouldn't work there. They needed special vehicles that could handle the Moon's surface and keep them safe. So, a tandem bike wouldn't do the job. No way!"
"(B) No

Stone Cold Steve Austin didn't wrestle in three different centuries. He was a big deal in the '90s and early 2000s, but that's just two centuries, not three."
"A: No

I heard the big stadium where they play football, Parc des Princes, wasn't open for games in June 2020. They had to close it because of that virus that was going around, you know, the one they call COVID-19. So, no games were played there then."
"A: No

Walt Disney couldn't send his drawings through email 'cause that stuff didn't exist back then. He had to use regular mail or show 'em in person."
"A: Yes

You need latitude to figure out where a place is on the map. It's like knowing how far up or down a spot is from the middle of the Earth. Without it, you can't really tell where exactly something is located."
"A: No

Pickles are real salty, and I heard that too much salt ain't good for folks with high blood pressure. So, I reckon a dozen pickles wouldn't be the best thing to eat if you're trying to keep your blood pressure down."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I reckon if Franz Ferdinand was shot by a gun, no amount of armadillo armor would've saved him. Armadillos got them some tough shells, but they ain't made to stop bullets. So, the answer would be:

(A) No"
"A: No

I reckon Helen Keller couldn't have read J.K. Rowling's books 'cause she passed away way before those stories came out."
"Well, let me think about this. Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat, and he was president after a Republican, William Howard Taft. After Wilson, another Republican, Warren G. Harding, became president. So, Wilson wasn't between two presidents from the same party as him. 

So, the answer is (B) No."
"Well, let's see. The Statue of Unity is really tall, like a big, big tower. The Statue of Liberty is also tall, but not as tall as the Statue of Unity. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a really old and tall building, but it's not around anymore. 

If we're talking about which one is closer in height to the Statue of Unity, the Statue of Liberty is much shorter, so it's not really close. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, even though it's gone, was closer in height to the Statue of Unity.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"Oh, I don't know much about all that fancy stuff, but I think the answer is (B) No. Moon Jae-in didn't get that German school thing when he was a teenager. He went to school in South Korea, not Germany."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Tom Cruise is a famous actor, but I don't think he'd be the one to explain something as specific as mental auditing. That sounds like something a professional in the field would know more about."
"A: (B) Yes

Grapes are really important for making wine. Without grapes, you can't make the real deal wine. They got the stuff inside that turns into alcohol when you let it sit and ferment. So, yeah, grapes are a must for winemaking."
"A: No

Doctor Strange and Batman are two different superheroes. Doctor Strange is from Marvel, and Batman is from DC. They were made by different people, so the answer is no."
"A: No

Wool don't always gotta be hand washed. Some wool clothes can go in the washing machine if you set it on a gentle cycle and use cold water. But always check the tag on the clothes to be sure!"
"Oh, I see. Well, Reza Shah, he was a leader in Iran a long time ago. Now, Jesus had 12 disciples, right? That's a pretty well-known number. As for Reza Shah, he didn't have more than 12 important followers or leaders that we know of. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Oh, I see. Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. I've heard a few Christmas songs that talk about saints, like that one about Good King Wenceslas. He was a saint, right? And there's another one about Saint Nicholas, the guy who gives out presents. So, yeah, there are definitely some Christmas carols named after saints."
"A: No

I don't think Robert De Niro uses a microscope at work. He's an actor, and actors mostly work in movies and TV shows, not in labs where they'd need a microscope."
"A: (B) Yes

I reckon Julio Gonzalez must've liked acetylene 'cause he used it for his metal work. He was a sculptor, and folks who work with metal often use acetylene for welding and cutting. So, it makes sense that he'd be okay with it."
"Well, I ain't got no fancy education, but I can still figure this out. If we're talkin' about watchin' a show and listenin' to an album, it all depends on how long they are. But usually, a TV show episode is about 45 minutes, and a music album can be around the same, sometimes a bit longer.

So, if I start watchin' ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" and it's a normal episode, and Ludacris's ""Release Therapy"" is a regular album, I reckon I could finish the show before the album ends.

So, my answer is:
(B) Yes"
"Well, let's think about this. Tiger Stadium, that big place where they play baseball, can hold a lot of people, but it's not that big. I heard it can fit about 53,000 folks. Now, during that hard time in 1933, when a lot of people didn't have jobs, there were way more than 53,000 people without work. It was like one in every four people in the whole country! So, no way all those folks could fit in that stadium.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"Well, let me think about this. If you're scared of earthquakes, which is what seismophobia means, you'd want a job where you don't have to worry about them, right? The Supreme Court of Canada is in Ottawa, and I don't think they have many earthquakes there. It's a big, sturdy building, and you'd be working inside, doing things like organizing papers and helping with court stuff. So, I reckon it would be a safe job for someone who's scared of earthquakes.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"B) No

I reckon Oscar Wilde wouldn't be treated the same way today in the US. Back then, they had some real strict and unfair laws. Nowadays, people can love who they want without getting in trouble with the law. The courts have changed their minds on stuff like that, so what happened to Wilde wouldn't fly now."
"Well, let me think 'bout this. The 2020 Jaguar F-Type, that's a fancy car, but it's small, only got room for two folks. Barack Obama's family is bigger than that, right? So, they wouldn't all fit. 

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, let's think about this. World of Warcraft is a big computer game, and a loaf of bread is just, well, a loaf of bread. The game takes up a lot of space on a computer, which is kind of like being heavy in the digital world. A loaf of bread, even if it's a big one, is still just a loaf of bread. So, in a way, the game is heavier.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I think the answer is (B) Yes. Rhinos have been around for a real long time, way before mongeese showed up. So, mongeese came later, I reckon."
"Well, from what I've heard about the Joker, he don't seem to have a good, healthy love life. He's always causing trouble and his relationships are all messed up. So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. I've heard that kids can do some pretty neat science experiments with a bit of help. If they've got someone older to show them how to do it safely, like using a laser pointer and some cardboard, they should be able to see those cool light patterns. Just gotta make sure they don't point the laser in their eyes or anything!"
"Well, I ain't too sure about all the fancy details, but I know Jennifer Lawrence's middle name is Shrader. And I reckon that fella Scorsese works a lot with Robert De Niro. Since ""Shrader"" and ""De Niro"" don't sound nothing alike, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: (A) Yes

Yeah, anchovies are used in Italian food. You see 'em on pizzas and in pasta sometimes. They're little fish that add a lot of flavor."
"A: No

You can't just drive around with airplane fuel if you only have a regular driver's license. There's a lot more to it. You gotta know how to handle dangerous stuff safely, and there are special rules and training you need to go through. So, it's not as simple as just having a driver's license."
"A: No

I heard that some folks worry about young people taking these medicines for feeling sad, but the doctors say they're usually safe. They just need to be extra careful and watch for any changes, especially at the start. The doctors make sure to check in a lot to keep everything okay. So, it's not that they're less safe, just that they need more attention."
"B) No

Christians don't really talk about Sheol. They usually talk about going to heaven if they've been good, or to hell if they haven't. Sheol is more of an old Jewish thing, not something Christians focus on."
"(B) No

I don't think Lil Jon's top song on that fancy chart was with someone from The Lox. His big hits were with other folks, like Ludacris. The Lox are a different group, and I don't recall them working together on his biggest songs."
"A: No

The first Duke of Valentinois, Cesare Borgia, didn't have anything to do with the Hundred Years' War. That war was all about England and France fighting each other a long time ago, way before Cesare Borgia was even born. He was more into his own stuff in Italy."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. The military, especially a place like the United States Military Academy, needs folks who are in top shape. They got to be able to do all sorts of physical stuff and be ready for anything. If someone has a condition like multiple sclerosis, which can make it hard to do physical activities, they probably wouldn't let that person join. It's just the way it is."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. A koala's pouch is made for its little baby, not for stuff like coins. I don't think a nickel would fit in there at all."
"B: Yes

I reckon the Powerpuff Girls could go to the Camden Military Academy if they wanted to. They're super strong and smart, so they'd probably do just fine there, even if it's a place for older kids."
"A: (B) Yes

Strawberries can get little critters that folks might call ""worms."" These aren't the same as what dogs get, but they can still mess with the plants and the berries. So, yeah, strawberries can have their own kind of worms."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I think Bucharest is up north, and Egypt is way down south. So, Bucharest ain't south of Egypt, right?

(A) No
(B) Yes

The answer is (A) No."
"A: Yes

I reckon it could! Diwali's all about celebrating with yummy food, and if your family likes seafood, why not have some prawns or crab? It's all about what you and your folks enjoy."
"B: No

I don't think Christina Aguilera ever turned her chair for Kelly Clarkson on that show. Kelly Clarkson was already a big star before ""The Voice"" even started, so she wouldn't have been on there as a contestant."
"B) No

Well, I reckon it wouldn't be too familiar. Over in China, they got their own special drinks and snacks at Starbucks. They like their green tea and red bean stuff, which ain't something you see much in America. So, if you go there, you might see some things on the menu that look a bit different from back home."
"Well, I ain't never met General Zod, but if I had to guess, I reckon he'd go for the iPhone. It's the fancier one, right? People always talk 'bout how good iPhones are. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"Well, let me think about this. I know 30th Street Station in Philly is really busy, with lots and lots of people going through it every day. I've heard it's like a small city in there! Now, Dorton Arena, that's a big place too, but I don't think it's as big as the number of people in that station.

If I had to guess, I'd say that Dorton Arena can hold a few thousand people, maybe around 7,000 or so. But 30th Street Station? I bet it sees way more than that, probably over 100,000 people a day. That's just too many to fit in one building, no matter how big it is.

So, my answer is:
(B) No

All those people from 30th Street Station couldn't fit in Dorton Arena."
"A: No

Building a portfolio ain't really something a construction worker needs to do. Most of the time, it's all about showing up, doing the work, and having the right skills. If you can prove you know what you're doin', that's usually enough. But if you wanna show off some big projects or get into management, it might help to have some pictures and stuff to show people. But it's not required."
"Oh, I see. Well, let me think about this. Karaoke, that's the thing where you sing along to music, right? I heard that came from Japan. And the turtle power tiller, that's some kind of farming tool, and I think I heard it was made in the Philippines. So, they weren't made in the same place, right?

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"A: No

I don't think Nigella Lawson cares much about solubility. She's all about cooking and making yummy food, not about science stuff like that."
"(B) Yes

I heard that way back in the old days, in Greece, they used to think celery had something to do with death. They'd put it in wreaths for people who passed away and stuff. Don't ask me why, but that's what they say."
"Well, I ain't no scholar, but I know that Paul the Apostle, one of them important figures in the Christian faith, was said to have been killed by beheading. Now, this Ahimsa thing you're talkin' about, it's all about not hurting no one, right? So, if Paul got his head cut off, that sure sounds like it goes against not hurting anyone. So, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

Muhammad wasn't from around here, you know? He lived way back in time and far away, in a place called Arabia. The Uniting Church in Australia is a much newer thing, and it's in Australia. So, Muhammad couldn't have been a member."
"B: Yes

I heard that some of the ladies who played Amazons in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" got parts in other shows later on. Can't remember all the details, but I know a couple of them did."
"A: No

I ain't never heard of no train goin' to the Underworld. That's just a story, ain't it? Amtrak's for goin' to real places, like other cities and stuff. Not for mythological places."
"A: No

Drummers don't need spare strings 'cause drums don't have strings. They hit the drums with sticks or their hands. It's the guitar players who need spare strings."
"A: No

I don't think oysters are used to make guitars. Oysters are those things you find in the sea, and guitars are made of wood and stuff. They're totally different!"
"Oh, no, sweetie. Barack Obama didn't have nothin' to do with the Reformation. That was way back in the day, like hundreds of years ago, when Martin Luther and all them were around. Obama's a modern-day guy, born much later. So the answer is (B) No."
"A: No

Not all kids get free lunch at school. Some schools have programs to help kids who can't afford to pay, but not everyone gets it. You gotta be in a family that doesn't make much money to get free or cheaper lunch. Some kids bring their own food too."
"A: No, I can't taste ""Law & Order."" It's a TV show, not somethin' you can eat!"
"A: No

Snoop Dogg don't seem to hold no grudges when it comes to makin' music. He's worked with all sorts of folks, even if they're from different or rival groups. Music brings people together, you know?"
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I've heard that Düsseldorf don't have too many smoggy days. It's a clean place, from what I know. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"Well, let me think about this. An ocelot is a wild cat, right? They're known to be pretty fast and agile. Kids, even kindergartners, are quick little things, but I reckon a wild cat like an ocelot would be way faster. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes

An ocelot could definitely outrun a kindergartner."
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I know Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and Democrats usually support stuff like abortion rights. So, she probably wouldn't denounce abortion. 

The answer is (B) No."
"A: No

Richard III wasn't the ruler of Adelaide. He was a king in England a long time ago, way before Adelaide even existed. Adelaide is a city in Australia, and it didn't become a city until much later. So, the answer is (A) No."
"A: No

The ""holy trinity"" in cooking needs all three veggies: onions, bell peppers, and celery. If you leave out the celery, it ain't the real deal. Celery gives it that special flavor, and without it, it just ain't the same."
"A: No

The ships back in Columbus's time were tiny compared to what we have now. They couldn't even come close to carrying something as big as the Statue of Liberty. That thing is huge! It's like trying to fit a skyscraper on a little boat. So, no way could the biggest ship from Columbus's voyages haul the Statue of Liberty."
"Oh, I see. Well, if we're talking about Adam, the first man, and the Holy Land, I think the answer is:

(B) No

The Holy Land is a place that became important much later, after Adam's time. So, it wouldn't have belonged to his tribe."
"B) No

Mixing ammonia and Clorox is a big no-no. It can make some really bad gases that can hurt your lungs and eyes. Just don't do it, okay? It's not worth the risk."
"Well, I reckon a pear would float in water. Most fruits do, don't they? So, my answer is:

(A) Yes"
"A: No

See, when someone passes away, they don't feel things anymore. Embalming is just a way to make the body look better for the funeral, but it doesn't change that the person can't feel anything. So, embalmed bodies don't feel different at funerals 'cause they don't feel anything at all."
"A: (A) Yes

Eatin' too many oranges can give you the runs. They got a lot of fiber and some kind of sugar that can mess with your tummy if you eat too much. So, yeah, it's best to not go overboard with 'em."
"A: No

Sara Paxton ain't Latino. She's got blonde hair and green eyes, and she's from America. Her family comes from places like England, Ireland, and Scotland, not from Spanish-speaking countries. So, she's not considered Latino."
"A: No

I don't know much about big boats or tunnels, but I'm pretty sure a huge cruise ship like the Oasis can't fit through a tunnel made for cars. That tunnel is for cars and trucks, not for boats!"
"A: No

I heard that when they looked at Gauss's brain after he died, it wasn't like a regular person's brain. They said it had some special wrinkles or something that made it different. So, I guess his brain wasn't normal."
"A: No

The KKK don't like folks of different colors, especially leaders like Opal Tometi who stand up for Black people. They wouldn't want her in their group."
"A: Yes

People still see the name Ford a lot. It's on cars all over the place, and you hear about it on TV and stuff. So, yeah, it's still around."
"(B) No

Don King is a boxing promoter. He ain't never killed nobody. Charles Manson, though, was a bad guy who got people to do some real bad things. But he didn't kill anyone with his own hands in 1971. So, Don King hasn't killed more people than Charles Manson did."
"A: No

Well, you see, the Scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz"" is just a bunch of straw and old clothes. He ain't a real person, so he can't get sick or have health problems like cerebral palsy. That's something only real folks can have. So, the answer is no, the Scarecrow couldn't get cerebral palsy."
"A: No

I ain't heard of none of Pope Alexander VI's kids or grandkids bein' made saints. He was a pretty controversial pope, and his family was known for gettin' into all sorts of trouble. So, it makes sense that none of 'em got that kind of holy recognition."
"Oh, no, they didn't have those big boom bombs back then. The Napoleonic Wars were way before that kind of stuff. They used muskets and cannons, you know, the old-fashioned weapons.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"B) Yes

I reckon Gateway would be mighty jealous of the Doctor's TARDIS. That thing can go anywhere and anywhen, and it's bigger on the inside! That's some fancy stuff that beats just popping from place to place."
"Well, let's see. JAG, that's a TV show, right? It's got a bunch of episodes. If you watch it every day, even just a little bit, you can probably finish it in six months. So, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"A: No

I reckon the small intestine won't break down a cotton ball. It's made to handle food, not stuff like cotton. If you swallow something like that, it could get stuck and cause problems. Best to be careful and not eat things that ain't food."
"A: No

Eatin' hair ain't good for ya. It's just not somethin' your body's made to digest. It can get stuck in yer gut and cause all sorts of trouble. Best to leave it be."
"Well, I ain't no historian, but I know the Cuban Revolution was a big deal down in Cuba. But up here in the U.S., folks were just livin' their lives. The U.S. had its baby boom after the war, but that was way before the Cuban stuff. So, to answer your question:

(B) No

The U.S. didn't have a population boom during the Cuban Revolution."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes. I mean, big companies buy other big companies all the time, right? If Sainsbury's wanted to, and they had the money, they could probably try to buy Tesco. But it would be a big deal, and I bet the government would have to say it's okay first."
"A: Yes

I reckon kids shouldn't be anywhere near those special brownies. They can make grown-ups act funny, so they sure ain't good for little ones. Best to keep 'em safe and away from that stuff."
"(B) Yes

I reckon Poland Spring could make some money in the Sahara. Think about it: the Sahara is super dry, and people there really need water. If you're a tourist or someone living in a remote area, you'd be willing to pay for a bottle of clean water. Plus, if they can get the water there and sell it, folks would buy it, especially if it's a brand they trust. So, even though it might be tough to get the water there, if they figure it out, they could definitely make some money."
"A: No

I think Spain ain't the least when it comes to popes. There were a few Spanish popes, like Pope Alexander VI and his uncle Pope Callixtus III. So, Spain's not the least represented."
"Well, I ain't got much book learnin', but I do know that Nicole Kidman was married to Tom Cruise, and he's a big name in that Scientology thing. So, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes."
"B) No

I don't think you can save all the HD episodes of Game of Thrones on that phone. The phone doesn't have enough space, and even if you add more storage, it would take up too much room for other stuff you need."
"A: No

Most women don’t have moustaches. You might see a little bit of fine hair above their lips, but it’s not usually thick or dark like a moustache. Some women might have more hair there because of their body, but it’s not common to see a full moustache on a woman."
"Well, I ain't never been to no fancy places, but I do know that Central Park Zoo is right there in Central Park, and that whole park is on Manhattan Island. So, yeah, it's on an island.

A: (B) Yes"
"A: Yes

Sure, you can use cast iron skillets on a glass-top stove. Just be careful, okay? Don't slide the skillet around, and try to be gentle when you put it down. If the bottom of the skillet is rough, you might want to put something soft underneath it to protect the glass. And don't put a cold skillet on a hot stove or a hot skillet on a cold stove, 'cause that can make the glass crack. But other than that, it should be fine!"
"A: (B) Yes

The big building in Paris called the Pantheon has its own special name. It's a place where important people are buried, and it's really famous. So, it's got a unique name, just like how you might have a special name for your house."
"Well, I ain't no scientist, but I reckon the answer is (B) No. I've heard that diamonds are real heavy, so they'd probably just sink right to the bottom if you put 'em in water."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. I've heard of some baseball teams with names that sound like weather stuff, like storms or lightning. So, they don't seem to avoid those kinds of names."
"Well, I reckon anyone can do a lot of things if they put their mind to it. R. Kelly's a singer, but that don't mean he can't write a thesis if he wanted to. So, I'd say:

(B) Yes"
"B: No

I reckon the Cookie Monster wouldn't say no to free cookies. He loves 'em too much!"
"Well, I ain't no expert, but I think sables and wolverines are related. They're both part of that big family of animals that includes weasels and otters. So, the answer would be:

(B) Yes"
"A: No

I don't think the guy who wrote ""A Christmas Carol"" fasted during Ramadan. He was a writer from England, and he wrote about Christmas, so he probably didn't follow that kind of fasting."
"A: No

Dale Earnhardt Jr. ain't no newbie. He's been racin' for a long time and won lots of races. Everyone knows him in NASCAR."
"A: No

Urban legends don't have to happen in cities. They can be about stuff that happens anywhere, like in the countryside or small towns. These stories are just modern tales that people tell and share, no matter where they live."
"Well, let me think about this. The idea of someone owning a whole country like Cambodia just doesn't make sense. Countries are big places with lots of people, and they have their own governments and laws. Even if someone had a ton of money, they can't just buy a country like you'd buy a house or a car.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, let me think about this. The 40th President, that was Ronald Reagan, right? He was around way before the internet was a thing that everyone used. So, he couldn't have been sending those funny cat pictures to his friends. 

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, let me think about this. In Ancient Greece, there were a lot of city-states, like Athens and Sparta. There were probably hundreds of them. In 1900, the United States had 45 states. So, if we're talking about numbers, Ancient Greece had way more city-states than the US had states in 1900.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, I ain't never heard of trees fightin' in no war. That sounds pretty silly, don't it? Trees are just for makin' stuff like houses and paper, not for fightin'. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: Yes

Basil is just a plant we use for cooking. It ain't gonna give you too much of that vitamin D stuff. You'd have to eat a whole lot of other things to worry about that. So, basil is safe, don't you worry!"
"Oh, no, he didn't. Christopher Columbus never went to Antarctica. He sailed to the Americas, but that's a whole different place. So the answer is (B) No."
"A: Yes

Being a sofer means you gotta work with animal skins to make the special papers for writing important religious stuff. If you don't eat or use animal stuff, like vegans do, then this job wouldn't be good for you."
"A: No

Aristotle was a smart guy from way back in ancient times, like really, really long ago. The House of Lords is a place in England where important people make decisions, but that didn't exist when Aristotle was around. So, he couldn't have been a part of it."
"A: (B) Yes

Chinchillas are little furry animals that are actually rodents, like mice or squirrels. They're not cats at all. So, if someone says a Chinchilla is a type of cat, that's not right. It's a rodent!"
"Oh, no, they didn't. The Nazis used a different flag with a swastika on it. They didn't use the hammer and sickle.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Oh, I see. Well, the right answer is (B) No. You see, Heath Ledger, he passed away because of a mix-up with his medicines, not because of the movie he was in. It was really sad, but it wasn't the movie that did it. He just had too many different pills in his system, and that's what caused it."
"A: (A) Yes

Having a lip piercing can make your dental bills go up. I've heard from folks who got lip piercings that they had to deal with chipped teeth and sore gums. This means more trips to the dentist and more money spent. So, it's not just a pretty look; it can cost you in the long run."
"Well, during a pandemic, it's best to keep things safe, you know? People are worried about catching the virus, and going door to door means you're knocking on a lot of doors and talking to a lot of folks. That's not a good idea when everyone's trying to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. So, yeah, it's probably best not to do that.

(A) Yes"
"Well, let me think about this. Alexander the Great lived a long time ago, way before the time when people started getting baptized. Baptism is something that came with Christianity, and that didn't happen until much later. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: Yeah, (A) Yes. An American could totally think a British breakfast is dinner. I mean, when you see all that food—eggs, bacon, sausages, and all that stuff—it looks like a big meal. It's so hearty, it could easily pass for dinner!"
"Well, let me think about this. The Thirty Years' War was a long time ago, and it lasted for, well, 30 years. Now, I've heard that parrots, like those white cockatoos, can live for a really long time. Some folks say they can live for over 50 years, even longer if they're taken care of well. So, if a cockatoo was around at the start of the war, it could have been alive when the war ended.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"A: Yes

I reckon a lifeboat can save folks in the Hooke Sea. If people are in trouble out there, a lifeboat is made to go out and help 'em, no matter what sea it is."
"A: (A) Yes

Disney owns a big comic book company. They bought Marvel, which makes lots of superhero comics like Spider-Man and the Avengers. So, Disney does own a major comic book publisher."
"Oh, no, the Sea of Japan ain't landlocked in Japan. It's a big stretch of water that touches Japan, but it also goes to other places like Korea and Russia. So, the answer is (B) No."
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. A birdwatcher would probably not go to a football game to watch birds. They'd be more likely to go to a place where there are lots of birds, like a park or a nature reserve. A football game is just too noisy and busy for birds, and the birdwatcher wouldn't find much to see there."
"A: (B) Yes

Well, you see, the Pulitzer Prize is something special that they give to people who make music, but it's only for people from America. Cheb Mami is from Algeria, so he can't win that prize, no matter how good his music is. It's like a club that only lets in people from one country. So, the answer is yes, it's not possible for him to win it."
"A: No

I don't think a swallow had any part in those King Arthur movies. They're just birds, right? Not like they can act or anything!"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, the Golden Gate Bridge is a big, real thing you can touch and walk on. An MP3 is something you listen to, like a song on your phone. You can't turn a bridge into a song just like that. It's like trying to turn your house into a sandwich—it just don't make sense!"
"Well, let me think about this. Running for President of India, that's a big deal, right? It's not like buying a loaf of bread. You gotta spend a lot of money on things like traveling all over the country, putting up posters, and maybe even TV ads. That's gotta cost a whole lot more than just a phone.

An iPhone 11, sure, it's a fancy phone, but it's just one phone. I've heard they cost around 50,000 rupees or so. But running for President? That's gotta be in the millions, at least.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"Well, I reckon it depends on the Deacon, but most Deacons probably wouldn't be big fans of a podcast that makes fun of religious movies. They might think it's not very respectful. So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"A: No

Ben and Jerry, they ain't runnin' the show no more. They started the ice cream company, but now it's part of a big company called Unilever. Ben and Jerry still do some stuff for fun and to help out, but they don't make the big decisions anymore."
"Well, let me think about this. The Gracie family, they're the ones who started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, right? I heard Carlos Gracie had a whole bunch of kids, like more than 20! And his brother Hélio had a few too. So, if we're talking about at least 13 kids, which is what a baker's dozen means, then yeah, they definitely had more than that.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"A: (B) Yes

Brooklyn's got a lot of good bakeries. People there make some really tasty bread. You can find all sorts of breads, from bagels to rye bread, and lots of other yummy stuff. So, yeah, Brooklyn is known for its bread."
"A: No

Christmas don't always come on a Sunday. It's always on December 25th, but that day can be any day of the week, not just Sunday."
"A: No

Being in your forties doesn't mean you can't remember things well. Lots of people my age still have good memories. It all depends on how you take care of yourself and how much you use your brain. Some folks might feel a bit forgetful, but that's not because of their age alone."
"Well, let me think about this. Harry Potter, that's a big deal, right? I mean, there were so many movies, and everyone talks about it. Kids love it, and there's all sorts of stuff you can buy, like wands and robes. Plus, there are those big theme parks where people go to pretend they're wizards. That's gotta bring in a lot of money.

The Matrix, yeah, it's cool and all, but there weren't as many movies. It's more for grown-ups who like sci-fi and action. It's popular, but not as much as Harry Potter.

So, if I had to pick, I'd say Harry Potter was the better investment for Warner Bros.

(B) Yes"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. Boxers get hit in the face a lot, and even though they wear those mouth things, they still can end up with broken teeth and stuff. So, they probably gotta spend more on dentists than most folks."
"A: No

I mean, Queen Elizabeth I was way back in the day, like, you know, a long, long time ago. Jean-Paul Sartre, he's more recent, like, from the 1900s. So, there's no way she could've read his stuff."
"Well, I ain't no doctor or ballet expert, but I reckon open heart surgery takes a good long while, maybe 3 to 6 hours or more. A ballet like ""Swan Lake"" is a big show, but it usually wraps up in about 3 to 4 hours, give or take. So, if the surgery is on the longer side, it might not be done by the time the ballet ends.

So, my answer is:
(B) No"
"A: No

Making a jet plane is really, really hard. It's not something one person can do all by themselves. You need lots of people who know different things, like how to make the parts, how to put them together, and how to make sure it's safe to fly. You also need big machines and special materials that are hard to get. Plus, you need a place to build it and test it, which costs a lot of money. So, you can't make a jet plane without help from a lot of other people and the stuff that society provides."
"A: No

Astronomers, they look at the stars and stuff to learn about space and the universe. But they don't write those horoscope things you see in the newspaper. Those are more like fun predictions, not real science. So, astronomers stick to the science stuff."
"A: No

The Catholic Church has its own special people they call saints. To become a saint, you gotta be part of their church and do really good things that show you're super holy. The Dalai Lama is a big leader in a different religion called Buddhism, so the Catholic Church won't consider him a saint."
"Oh, I see. Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. You see, a sesame seed is tiny and looks like a little dot, usually white or brown, and you find it in food. A wood frog egg, though, is something you'd find in water, and it's more like a little black dot surrounded by a clear, jelly-like stuff. They're just too different to mix up, even if you ain't seen many frogs or cooked much with sesame seeds."
"A: No, I don't think Pink Floyd ever made a song about the French Riviera. They had lots of other stuff, but not that one."
"B) Yes

I heard that Jamie Lee Curtis, like a lot of famous folks, sometimes gets talked about in stories that ain't true. People make up stuff about her all the time."
"Well, let me think about this. Godzilla is a big, tough monster, right? He's like a giant lizard that can breathe fire and stomp on buildings. I've seen him in movies, and he always seems to survive no matter what happens. So, if there was a big earthquake, I don't think it would be enough to kill him. 

So, the answer is (B) No."
"(B) No

Taking ukemi don't stop the energy, it just helps you fall safer. You roll or fall in a way that your body doesn't get hurt as much. It's like when you jump from a high place and you roll when you land, you don't stop the fall, but you make it so you don't hurt yourself."
"Well, I ain't heard nothin' 'bout the royal family gettin' into any big trouble like that in 2020. They might have had some gossip and stuff, but nothing that made 'em look like they did a serious crime. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"Well, I reckon the answer is (B) No. The NY Stock Exchange closing bell is a big deal in New York, but it don't make no noise all the way out in California where Universal Music Group is. They got their own stuff goin' on out there!"
"Well, I've heard folks talk about ""The Jungle Book"" having some parts that might not be so nice when it comes to how different people are shown. Some say it's got stuff in there that could be seen as racist, especially if you look at it from today's point of view. But I guess it depends on how you read it and what you take from it.

So, if I had to pick, I'd say:

(B) Yes, but it's not clear-cut and can depend on how you look at it."
"A: No

I don't know much about numbers and stuff, but I do know that back in the 1980s in China, the government said most families could only have one kid. So, having a number like ""pi"" kids, which is some fancy math thing, wouldn't make sense. You can't have a part of a kid, right? So, the answer is no."
"A: No

Bruiser Brody never wrestled on WWE Raw. He was a big deal in wrestling, but he passed away before WWE Raw even started."
"(B) No

Sables are little critters, not very heavy. If you need something to weigh down a scale, you'd want somethin' heavier, like a big rock or a heavy bag. Sables just ain't gonna do the job."
"Well, let me think about this. American Independence Day is on July 4th, and that's in the summertime, not autumn. So, the answer is (B) No."
"(B) No

I reckon James Cotton's instrument wouldn't be too strident for a smooth jazz band. Sure, his harmonica can be mighty strong and clear, but if he plays it right, it can fit in just fine with the smooth sounds of jazz. Musicians can adjust how they play, so I don't think it'd be a problem."
"A: (A) Yes

I heard there's a big, fuzzy creature called the Yeti at one of them Disney parks. It's part of a ride where you go on this wild adventure and the Yeti is supposed to scare you. Sounds pretty exciting!"
"A: Yeah, people who smoke Djarum's usually like the cloves. It's kinda the whole point, you know? The cloves give it that special taste. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"Well, let's see. Kate Gosselin, she's got herself and her eight kids, right? That makes nine people in total. Now, for a Bandy team, you need 11 people to play. So, if you only got nine, you're short by two. 

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"A: No

The Great Recession was really bad, but it wasn't the worst time for jobs. There was a time called the Great Depression that was even worse. Back then, a lot more people couldn't find work. So, the Great Recession wasn't the period with the most unemployment."
"A: No

I don't think anyone from the Last Supper is celebrated in Islam. In our religion, we respect Jesus, but we don't talk about that dinner party he had with his friends. We focus more on Jesus being a prophet and his teachings."
"A: No

I think the peasants in Japan and the serfs in England were both not in the best position, but the serfs in England had it worse. The serfs in England were stuck to the land and had to do what the lord said all the time. They couldn't leave without permission and had to give a lot of their work to the lord. In Japan, the peasants could move around more and had a bit more control over their own lives. But still, both groups didn't have it easy."
"Well, let's see. Andrew Johnson, he was a president, right? I think he was the 17th one. Now, this Elagabalus, he was some kind of emperor a long, long time ago. I heard he was the 27th emperor or something like that. So, if we're comparing numbers, 17 is less than 27, right?

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, I ain't read no fancy books or nothing, but I heard about this book ""The Catcher in the Rye."" Some folks say it's a big deal, but I don't think it makes people go crazy or do bad things. Most people just read it and think about their own lives, you know? It's not like the book tells you to do anything wrong.

So, my answer is:
(A) No"
"B) No

Disneyland Paris ain't the biggest Disney place. The biggest one is in Florida, called Walt Disney World. It's got way more stuff and is much bigger."
"A: No

Well, I ain't never been to Venus, but I reckon you can't go water skiing there. They say it's super hot and there ain't no water, just a bunch of toxic stuff in the air. So, no water skiing for sure!"
"Well, I ain't no expert, but from what I've heard, people with DID, that's Dissociative Identity Disorder, don't always have a good memory. They can forget a lot of stuff, especially big things that happened to them. Sometimes, different parts of their mind remember different things, so it can be all mixed up. So, I'd say:

(B) No

They don't usually have a good memory, at least not all the time."
"Oh, no, the Carnation Revolution wasn't the deadliest one in Europe. It was actually pretty peaceful! People just put flowers in their guns and stuff. There were other revolutions that were way more violent, like the French Revolution. So, the answer is (B) No."
"B) Yes

Diving really deep in the Red Sea would be super hard for anyone, even if they're really good at diving. The water is super deep, and it's not like swimming in a pool. It's dangerous and needs a lot of special stuff and help from other people. So, yeah, it would be very difficult."
"Well, I ain't sure about Post Malone and his fears, but from what I've heard and seen, there ain't no talk about him bein' scared of needles. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) No"
"A: No

Methane is just a gas you can't see. It's like the air we breathe—there, but invisible. You need special tools to spot it if it's leaking or something."
"A: No

I don't think the King of Portugal in 1515 had any family ties to the Tudors. They were from different countries and different royal families."
"Well, let me think about this. Johnny Carson, he was that funny man on TV, right? I heard he had a few kids, but not a whole lot. To play water polo, you need a bunch of people in the water and some more on the side. I think you need at least seven people just to start a game. Johnny Carson only had three kids, so they couldn't even get in the water and play, let alone have any substitutes. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: Yes

Nikola Tesla's name has been used by a bunch of companies. The most famous one is probably Tesla, the car company that makes electric cars. They named it after him because he was a big inventor who worked a lot with electricity. There are also other smaller companies and stuff that use his name because he was so smart and did a lot of cool things."
"A: No, a dentist don't fix Bluetooth stuff. They work on teeth and mouths, not on tech problems. So, the right answer is (A) No."
"A: No

I don't think a fancy tailor would use glue to make pants shorter. They know how to sew real good, so they'd use a needle and thread to make sure it stays nice and doesn't come apart. Glue might mess up the pants and look all messy."
"Well, if Sugar Ray Robinson stole in Iran, he might get in big trouble, like go to jail or face other harsh punishments. If he's locked up, he can't box, right? So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"Well, let's think about this. A cheetah is real fast, but it ain't that strong. Big Show, on the other hand, is a big, strong fella. I reckon a cheetah wouldn't stand a chance against Big Show's size and strength. So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"A: No

I ain't never heard nobody shoutin' ""Marco Polo"" near no water, 'cept maybe in them pool games where folks play it for fun. But that ain't nothin' to do with the real Marco Polo, the explorer fella."
"A: No

Citrus fruits like oranges and lemons need warm weather to grow. Ulaanbaatar is really cold, especially in winter, so citrus plants wouldn't survive there. They need sunshine and warmth, which Ulaanbaatar doesn't have enough of."
"Well, I reckon frogs don't really feel disgust like we do. They just do what they need to survive, you know? So, I'd say:

(A) No"
"(B) No

I reckon Woodrow Wilson wouldn't have been a big fan of the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. He was a smart guy and a president, and while he did some things that weren't great when it came to race, I think he would have seen that separating people based on race wasn't fair or right. So, I'm going with No."
"Well, I reckon you could read The Atlantic magazine during the Games of the XXII Olympiad. It was around back then, so yeah, you could probably get your hands on it if you wanted to.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"A: No

Months ain't based on the sun's cycle. They're more about the moon and how it goes around the Earth, but the way we count months now is set up to match up with how long it takes the Earth to go around the sun. So, it's a bit of both, but mostly, months started with the moon."
"A: No

Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. weren't from the same church. Martin Luther was all about the Lutheran church, and Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist. So they weren't the same."
"A: No

I ain't never heard of Pearl Harbor bein' the home of no shark goddess. It's famous 'cause of that big attack that happened there during the war, you know? But I don't think it's got anything to do with shark goddesses or any of that myth stuff."
"A: No

King Arthur was from way back in the olden days, long before Anne Boleyn's time. So he couldn't have been there when she got beheaded."
"A: Yes

I reckon a paraplegic person can totally conduct an orchestra. Conducting is all about waving your arms and hands to tell the musicians what to do. It's not like you need your legs for that. Plus, it's mostly about knowing the music and being able to lead the group. So, if someone knows their stuff and can wave their arms, they should be good to go!"
"B: Yes

I reckon Tenzing Norgay, being such a famous climber who made it to the top of Mount Everest, wouldn't find Snowdon too tough. It's a lot smaller than the big mountains he's used to, so it should be easy for him."
"Well, let's think about this. Javier Sotomayor is a human who can jump really high, like way up in the air. A Bengal cat, even though it's a good jumper, is just a cat. Cats are small, and they can jump a few times their own height, but that's still not as high as what Javier can do. So, a Bengal cat wouldn't be able to jump as high as Javier Sotomayor.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Tony Bennett, he's been married a few times, right? But I heard he's got more kids than the number of times he's been married. So, if I'm countin' right, he's got more kids than wives. So, the answer would be:

(A) Yes"
"A: No

Fish don't get tonsillitis 'cause they don't have tonsils like we do. They've got their own way of fighting off sickness, but it ain't the same as what we've got in our throats."
"A: No, he didn't. Boris Yeltsin passed away before the 2008 Summer Olympics happened."
"A: No

Darth Vader and Severus Snape are just two different guys from different stories. Vader is this big, scary guy in a black suit who breathes funny and is all about the dark side. Snape is more like a sneaky teacher who’s always grumpy and wears long robes. They both have their secrets, but they’re not the same kind of person. So, they don’t really match up."
"A: No

I don't know all the fancy laws, but I'm pretty sure kids ain't allowed to drive for work. They gotta be old enough to have a real driver's license and stuff. So, no way a kid can do that, even if they're driving a fancy car like a Mercedes-Benz."
"A: (B) No

Well, you see, most stores got rules about how you gotta be dressed. Donald Duck, he don't wear no pants, and that ain't gonna fly in most places. They'd probably ask him to put some on before he comes in. So, I reckon he wouldn't be allowed in."
"Well, from what I understand, two men can't have a baby on their own. They don't have the parts to make a baby the natural way. So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: No

Michael's a pretty common name, ain't it? You hear it a lot, so I reckon it's not unpopular at all."
"A: No

I reckon John Gall wasn't from the same city as Stanford University. Stanford is way out in California, and I heard John Gall was from somewhere else, like Michigan or somethin'. So, they weren't from the same place."
"A: No

Retail ain't a job for just anybody. You gotta be good with people, know how to talk to 'em, and be able to handle all sorts of situations. You also gotta be on your feet a lot and work when others are off, like weekends and holidays. Not everyone can do that. So, it's not for everyone."
"A: No

Well, you see, the Battle of Actium was a long time ago, way back in the old days. They used wooden ships and fought with swords and stuff. If the Brazilian Navy, with all its big ships and fancy technology, showed up, it would be like bringing a super powerful toy to a playground where everyone else is playing with sticks and stones. The Brazilian Navy would win super easy, but that's not really what the question is asking.

The question is if the Brazilian Navy could change the whole battle. But you gotta think about it this way: the battle was part of a big fight between important people back then. If the Brazilian Navy came, it would be so different that it would change everything, not just the battle. It would be like if a spaceship landed in the middle of a medieval war. Everything would be different, and it wouldn't be the same battle anymore.

So, the answer is No. The Brazilian Navy could win the battle, but it wouldn't be the same battle, and it wouldn't make sense to say it could ""turn the tide"" in the way the question is asking."
"A: No, they don't have that at Taco Bell. They got their own stuff like tacos and burritos, but no injera."
"Oh, I see. Well, let me think about this. Lord Voldemort, he's the big bad wizard, right? And Durmstrang is that school far away where they teach dark magic. But I don't think Voldemort had anything to do with the teachers there. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
