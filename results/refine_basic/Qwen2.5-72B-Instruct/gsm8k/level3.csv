"To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Determine the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download a 200 GB file, considering the interruption and restart, we need to break down the process into steps:

1. **Initial Download (40% of 200 GB):**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the Download (Full 200 GB):**
   - After the restart, Carla has to download the full 200 GB again.
   - The time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance traveled: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \).
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance traveled: \( 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home: \( 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \).

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Distance from home: \( 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \).

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will break down the problem step by step, focusing on the percentage changes and multi-step calculations.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Downloads in the second month = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Subtract this reduction from the second month's downloads:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126
     \]

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
     \[
     60 + 180 + 126 = 366
     \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."

"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to perform a break-even analysis. This involves calculating the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

### Step-by-Step Break-Even Analysis:

1. **Initial Cost (Fixed Cost)**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
   \[
   \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost (Variable Cost)**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost.
   \[
   \text{Net Annual Profit} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Break-Even Point Calculation:
The break-even point is the number of years it takes for the total net profit to equal the initial cost.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to break even. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
\text{Total Net Profit} = 7.5n
\]

We set the total net profit equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point:
\[
7.5n = 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Final number of vacuum cleaners:**
   Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after all sales.

2. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Therefore, before selling at the orange house, she had:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house. Therefore, before selling at the red house, she had:
   \[
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Therefore, the 12 vacuum cleaners she had before the red house represent the remaining two-thirds of her original stock. Let \( y \) be the number of vacuum cleaners she had before the green house:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} y = 12
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we start by calculating the total number of eggs she uses daily and then extend that to the total period.

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet each morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.
3. Therefore, the total number of eggs used in 4 weeks is 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Thus, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know the time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
- Therefore, she has already spent \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours hiking.

The remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) be the original price. The equation representing the discounted price is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To solve the problem of finding Allen's age 10 years from now, given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age is 162, we can set up and solve a system of equations.

Let's denote:
- Darrell's age by \( D \)
- Allen's age by \( A \)

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]

2. The sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]

Now, substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the second equation:
\[
\frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[
\frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162
\]
\[
\frac{18A}{11} = 162
\]

Multiply both sides by 11 to clear the fraction:
\[
18A = 1782
\]

Solve for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{1782}{18} = 99
\]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[
99 + 10 = 109
\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the individual guesses and then find their mean.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can use multiplication to find the solution efficiently.

First, we know that:
- John takes care of 10 dogs.
- Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.

To find the total daily care time:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, to find the total weekly care time:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, we multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

To solve this system, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the value of \( S \), we can substitute it back into the second equation to find \( G \):

\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs a total of 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with the following schedule:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running each week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we use the formula for speed, which is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given rates, distances, and time. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Set up the equations for distance:**
   - Distance while running: \( \text{Distance}_{\text{running}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{running}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{running}} \)
   - Distance while walking: \( \text{Distance}_{\text{walking}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{walking}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{walking}} \)

5. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Running distance: \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.
   - Walking distance: \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps, focusing on the relationships between the quantities and prices of the ties.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of Cost per blue tie
   - Cost per red tie = 40 + 0.5 * 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = 600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Bailey started with. Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, which totals to \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

Thus, Bailey started with $60.

"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we can break down the problem into a series of multiplications and additions.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, the total number of classes is:
  \[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, the total number of classes on Saturday is:
  \[ 8 \text{ classes} \]

Adding these together, the total number of classes in a week is:
\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students. So, for 33 classes, the total number of students is:
  \[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student. So, for 495 students, the total amount of money is:
  \[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the properties of a geometric series. In a geometric series, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. Here, the common ratio is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

We can express the square footage of each level as follows:
- 4th level: \( 16 \)
- 3rd level: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
- 2nd level: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
- 1st level: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

The total square footage of all levels is the sum of this geometric series:
\[ S = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 \]

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]
where:
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( r \) is the common ratio,
- \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this case:
- \( a = 128 \)
- \( r = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( n = 4 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \frac{\frac{15}{16}}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \times \frac{15}{16} \times 2 \]
\[ S_4 = 128 \times \frac{15}{8} \]
\[ S_4 = 16 \times 15 \]
\[ S_4 = 240 \]

The total square footage of all levels is 240. To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the amount needed for the remaining days of the first year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the first year:**
   - The first year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - Total dog food for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Sum of the dog food for both periods: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

1. **Determine David's laundry:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, David's laundry is:
     \[
     \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine Raymond's laundry:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond's laundry is:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
   - Difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the amount of water each girl received. Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water. 

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters per girl} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy received 6 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial amount:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's define:
- \( W \) as the number of games won.
- \( L \) as the number of games lost.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (total games played)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (the team won 8 more games than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we have \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald's record sold. According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

Thus, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adult and child dinosaurs at the picnic.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs:
- Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \).

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs:
- Each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \).

Finally, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount required:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \).

Thus, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a series of linear equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of pets Cindy has.
2. According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets, so \( C = 4 \).
3. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia's number of pets \( M \) can be expressed as \( M = C + 2 \).
4. Substituting \( C = 4 \) into the equation for Marcia, we get \( M = 4 + 2 = 6 \).
5. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan's number of pets \( J \) can be expressed as \( J = 3M \).
6. Substituting \( M = 6 \) into the equation for Jan, we get \( J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
2. Let \( A \) represent Amy's age.
3. Let \( C \) represent Corey's age.
4. Let \( M \) represent James's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
- James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can use Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we will set up and solve an algebraic equation involving percentages. Let's denote Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     G = 38 + 2
     \]
   - Solving for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of his original time.
   - We can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Improved time} = G \times 0.90
     \]
   - Substituting \( G = 40 \) into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Improved time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( d \) represent the number of dogs.
- Let \( c \) represent the number of cats.
- Let \( r \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs:
   \[
   c = 2d
   \]

2. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   r = d + c - 12
   \]

3. The number of dogs is 60:
   \[
   d = 60
   \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( d \) into the other equations to find \( c \) and \( r \).

First, substitute \( d = 60 \) into the equation for \( c \):
\[
c = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, substitute \( d = 60 \) and \( c = 120 \) into the equation for \( r \):
\[
r = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168
\]

Now, we have the number of each type of pet:
- Dogs: \( d = 60 \)
- Cats: \( c = 120 \)
- Rabbits: \( r = 168 \)

To find the total number of pets, we sum these values:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = d + c + r = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

1. Calculate the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]

2. Calculate the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. Determine the number of girls in the girl scout:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
40

"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by calculating the amount of sleep James had. Given that James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can find James' sleep duration by multiplying 9 by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the difference in their sleep durations, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how this affects the number of tomatoes used.

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Initial volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Cars Driving Through in the Remaining 15 Minutes**: 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam.

We need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Plants:**
   Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   \[
   2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **New Plants Received:**
   Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery.
   \[
   80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Plants Given Away:**
   Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family.
   \[
   1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Final Number of Plants:**
   Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants.
   \[
   98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
   \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by each of Jerome's friends and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

"To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average each day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read. Adding the pages from each subject:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining number of pages is:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given information tells us that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, let's set up the ratio of the distances:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

We can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 3x = 420 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{420}{3} \]
\[ x = 140 \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

We know the following:
- On Monday, he watched 1 hour.
- On Tuesday, he watched 1 hour.
- On Wednesday, he watched \( 0.5x \) hours (since each episode is 30 minutes).
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[ x = 3 \]

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.

We can set up the equation based on the final number of cookies:
\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine the final cost of the gas after applying the cashback, we can break down the problem into two primary operations: multiplication and subtraction.

First, we calculate the total cost of the gas before any cashback is applied:
- The cost per gallon is $3.00.
- The number of gallons purchased is 10.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cashback:
- The cashback per gallon is $0.20.
- The number of gallons purchased is 10.
- Therefore, the total cashback is \( 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount:
- The total cost is $30.00.
- The total cashback is $2.00.
- Therefore, the final cost is \( 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \) dollars.

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into a system of equations and then solve for the unknowns. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( d \).

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( B \) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- Let \( J \) be the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold, which is given as 1800.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( J = 6B \)
2. \( B = 50d \)

We know \( J = 1800 \), so we can substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Now, we use the second equation to find \( d \):
\[ B = 50d \]
\[ 300 = 50d \]

Solving for \( d \):

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the new selling prices, which have increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

"To solve for the unknowns in the given ratio problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total quantity provided.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. The total quantity of both sugar and water combined is 120 units.

First, let's represent the quantities in terms of a common variable \( x \):
- Teaspoons of sugar = \( 7x \)
- Cups of water = \( 13x \)

The total quantity is the sum of these two:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Next, we find the number of teaspoons of sugar:

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles present at the port after the first day. Given that each container holds 5 vehicles and there were 2 containers on the first day:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles present after the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added on the second day by the number of vehicles per container:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to calculate the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - According to the problem, \( 40000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 16000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = $56,000.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pepper.
- Let \( w \) be the cost of one watermelon.
- Let \( o \) be the cost of one orange.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs:
   \[
   w = 3p
   \]

2. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon:
   \[
   o = w - 5
   \]

3. Each pepper costs 15 dollars:
   \[
   p = 15
   \]

Using the value of \( p \), we can find \( w \) and \( o \):

\[
w = 3p = 3 \times 15 = 45
\]

\[
o = w - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase:

- Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4w = 4 \times 45 = 180
  \]

- Dillon buys 20 peppers:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20p = 20 \times 15 = 300
  \]

- Dillon buys 10 oranges:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10o = 10 \times 40 = 400
  \]

Finally, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[

   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles.
   - Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage:
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

Thus, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim based on their respective distances and speeds.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home using their speeds:
- Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute
- Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies Carl has. Given that he buys ten packs of cookies and each pack contains six cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we determine the total cost of these cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

$4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards through the steps described, starting from the final number of fries and reversing each action.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left after the ants carried off one fry.
   \[
   \text{Before ants} = 5 + 1 = 6
   \]

2. **Raccoon's action**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third.
   \[
   \text{Before raccoon} = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

3. **Pigeons' action**: Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, totaling 9 fries.
   \[
   \text{Before pigeons} = 18 + 9 = 27
   \]

4. **Seagull's action**: The seagull ate 7 fries (half the amount Dave ate).
   \[
   \text{Before seagull} = 27 + 7 = 34
   \]

5. **Dave's action**: Dave ate 14 fries.
   \[
   \text{Before Dave} = 34 + 14 = 48
   \]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert the lengths of each type of baked good to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of compound interest, where the price of the bag of marbles increases by a fixed percentage over regular intervals. Here, the price increases by 20% every two months.

Given:
- Initial price (P) = $20
- Rate of increase (r) = 20% = 0.20
- Time period (t) = 36 months
- Compounding frequency (n) = 36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

However, since the rate is applied directly every two months, we can simplify this to:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ A = 20 (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ A = 20 (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ A = 20 \times 38.3376 \]
\[ A \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:
\[ \boxed{766.75} \]"
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

3. **Cost of the CD burner:**
   \[
   74 \, \text{€}
   \]

4. **Cost of the printer:**
   \[
   102 \, \text{€}
   \]

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's add these step by step:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke. Let \( S \) represent Seth's age and \( B \) represent Brooke's age. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
S + 2 + B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

"To determine the total time Billy will need to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into a system of equations and then solve for the unknowns.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations.
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]
3. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
4. Sandra also ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   R = 4C
   \]
5. Substituting \( C = 40 \) into the equation for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Since Fred has not delivered any red roses yet, he must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( J \) as Jean's age.
- \( M \) as Mark's age.
- Jan's age is given as 30.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark: 
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

Let's solve the second equation:
\[
M - 2 = 19
\]
\[
M = 19 + 2
\]
\[
M = 21
\]

Now, substitute \( M = 21 \) into the first equation to find \( J \):
\[
J = M + 2
\]
\[
J = 21 + 2
\]
\[
J = 23
\]

Thus, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race and then find the difference between these times.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they take \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables and equations step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).

2. **Straw distribution:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw in total.

3. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total straw for the rats is \( 3r \times 6 \).
   - The total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 \).
   - The total straw for the rabbits is 20.

   Therefore, the equation for the total straw distributed is:
   \[
   3r \times 6 + 10 \times 5 + 20 = 160
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   18r + 50 + 20 = 160
   \]
   \[
   18r + 70 = 160
   \]

6. **Solve for \( r \):**
   \[
   18r = 160 - 70
   \]
   \[
   18r = 90
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{90}{18}
   \]
   \[
   r = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

1. **Cost per bag**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and incurs a transportation cost of $2 per bag. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.

3. **Profit per bag**: The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the total cost:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A.
- \( y \) as the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher B.
- \( p_A \) as the payment per sentence from Publisher A.
- \( p_B \) as the payment per sentence from Publisher B.

From the problem, we know:
1. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
3. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays.

First, we can write the equation for the total number of sentences:
\[ x + y = 1000 \]

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher:
\[ x = y \]

Next, we know the payment rates:
\[ p_A = 5 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
\[ p_B = 2 \times p_A = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from each publisher:
- Earnings from Publisher A:
\[ \text{Earnings}_A = x \times p_A = x \times 5 \]

- Earnings from Publisher B:
\[ \text{Earnings}_B = y \times p_B = y \times 10 \]

Since \( x = y \), we can substitute \( y \) with \( x \):
\[ \text{Earnings}_A = x \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Earnings}_B = x \times 10 \]

The total earnings for the week is the sum of the earnings from both publishers:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_A + \text{Earnings}_B = x \times 5 + x \times 10 = 15x \]

Since \( x + y = 1000 \) and \( x = y \), we have:
\[ 2x = 1000 \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Substituting \( x = 500 \) into the total earnings equation:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 15 \times 500 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we add the cakes bought on each day to find the total:
\[
4 + 12 + 60 = 76
\]

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   Each plate costs $6000.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   \[
   \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   \[
   20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
145

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( R \) represent the number of red chickens and \( W \) represent the number of white chickens.

We know the following:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

From this information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( 3R + 5W = 42 \) (total eggs collected)
2. \( W = R + 2 \) (two more white chickens than red chickens)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To solve this problem, we need to use addition and subtraction to find the number of customers on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can set up the equation to find the number of customers on the third day:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of differential equations to model the situation. Let \( S(t) \) represent the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \) (in minutes), and \( B(t) \) represent the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \).

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can write the differential equations as:
\[ \frac{dS}{dt} = -4 \]
\[ \frac{dB}{dt} = -4 \]

We are given two conditions:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B(t-4) = 2S(t-4) \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B(t) = 4S(t) \]

First, we solve the differential equations. Since the rate of change is constant, we can integrate both equations:
\[ S(t) = S_0 - 4t \]
\[ B(t) = B_0 - 4t \]

where \( S_0 \) and \( B_0 \) are the initial amounts of water in the small and big pools, respectively, at time \( t = 0 \).

Using the second condition:
\[ B(t) = 4S(t) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t = 4(S_0 - 4t) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t = 4S_0 - 16t \]
\[ B_0 = 4S_0 - 12t \]

Now, using the first condition:
\[ B(t-4) = 2S(t-4) \]
\[ B_0 - 4(t-4) = 2(S_0 - 4(t-4)) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t + 16 = 2(S_0 - 4t + 16) \]
\[ B_0 - 4t + 16 = 2S_0 - 8t + 32 \]
\[ B_0 + 4t = 2S_0 + 16 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B_0 = 4S_0 - 12t \)
2. \( B_0 + 4t = 2S_0 + 16 \)

Substitute \( B_0 = 4S_0 - 12t \) into the second equation:
\[ 4S_0 - 12t + 4t = 2S_0 + 16 \]
\[ 4S_0 - 8t = 2S_0 + 16 \]
\[ 2S_0 = 8t + 16 \]
\[ S_0 = 4t + 8 \]

Since we are interested in the current amount of water in the small pool, we set \( t = 0 \):
\[ S_0 = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S(t) = S_0 - 4t \]
\[ S(0) = 8 - 4(0) \]
\[ S(0) = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy. The pair of shoes costs $320.00, and the matching belt costs $32.00. Adding these together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori must work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount Due
Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest.

The interest amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount due is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Paid
Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months.

The total amount paid over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Balance
The remaining balance is the total amount due minus the total amount paid:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, we calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack using the information provided.

1. Let \( H \) represent Harriet's current age. According to the problem, \( H = 21 \) years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so \( A = 3H \).
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so \( H = \frac{1}{2}Z \) or \( Z = 2H \).

Now, substitute \( H = 21 \) into the equations for Adrian and Zack:
- \( A = 3 \times 21 = 63 \) years
- \( Z = 2 \times 21 = 42 \) years

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \( H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \) years
- Adrian's age in three years: \( A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 \) years
- Zack's age in three years: \( Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 \) years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we use the formula for the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{(H + 3) + (A + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[
45

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jessa's age.
2. Let \( O \) represent Joan's age.
3. Let \( M \) represent Mary's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Jessa is 20 years old: \( J = 20 \)
- Joan is five years older than Jessa: \( O = J + 5 \)
- Mary is two years younger than Joan: \( M = O - 2 \)

First, substitute Jessa's age into the equation for Joan's age:
\[ O = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, substitute Joan's age into the equation for Mary's age:
\[ M = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, we have the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa: 20 years
- Joan: 25 years
- Mary: 23 years

To find the sum of their ages, we add these values together:
\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of candies Robert has,
- \( J \) as the number of candies James has,
- \( N \) as the number of candies John has.

From the problem, we know:
1. John has twice as many candies as Robert: \( N = 2R \).
2. John has 54 candies: \( N = 54 \).
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert: \( J = R + 6 \).

First, we can use the second piece of information to find \( R \):
\[ N = 54 \]
\[ 2R = 54 \]
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has:
\[ J = R + 6 \]
\[ J = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many more candies John has than James:
\[ N - J = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving multiplication, subtraction, and unit conversion. Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters he receives each week is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since Mike responds in kind, he needs to write 5 pages for each of the 6 letters.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to write each week is:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of fries Griffin has at each step and determine how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree
The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood eaten by the termites
The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight
\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has.
2. Let \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has.
3. Let \( A_a \) represent the number of apples Andrea has.
4. Let \( A_b \) represent the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
- Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Jamal's bananas and apples to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we use the relationship between Andrea's bananas and Jamal's bananas to find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we sum up all the fruits to find the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age and \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( R = 6S \) (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
2. \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. We know that each necklace is 25 inches long and consists of 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, and sterling silver beads, each 0.25 inches long.

First, let's calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let \( x \) be the number of sterling silver beads. Each bead is 0.25 inches long, so the total length occupied by the beads is:
\[ 0.25x \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is the sum of the lengths of the topaz gemstones and the sterling silver beads:
\[ 8 + 0.25x = 25 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 0.25x = 25 - 8 \]
\[ 0.25x = 17 \]
\[ x = \frac{17}{0.25} \]
\[ x = 68 \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to sum the crates sold over the days he was open and then subtract this total from his target.

Crates sold:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates.

Crates off target = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for his driving service, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus given to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Round trip distance: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Miles driven per week: 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
   - Miles driven per year: 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - Monthly bonus: $150
   - Total bonus per year: $150 * 12 months = $1,800

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
   - Total bonus: $1,800
   - Total annual cost: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:
$31,800"
"To determine the total exercise time Peter needs on Tuesday, we start by adding the exercise times from Sunday and Monday. 

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. 
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

Adding these times together:
23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Peter's goal is to exercise for twice this total on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the total by 2:
39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to meet his goal.

"To solve the problem of determining how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the pattern of how pages are arranged on each piece of paper. Each piece of paper, when folded, can hold 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can determine the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} \]

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the amount Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50, which is calculated as:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. The total amount spent is the sum of these two expenditures:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is $15.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - The problem states that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2x \).
   - Substituting \( x = 45 \), the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books initially is 250.
   - The number of unsold books is 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is the sum of the books sold in each year.
   - Therefore, \( 90 + y + 45 = 200 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 135 + y = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 200 - 135 = 65 \).

5. **Calculate the earnings for the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The earnings for the second year are \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed very well for the entire month.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step, focusing on the fractions involved.

1. **Total Loaves Produced:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Morning Sales:**
   Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves Remaining After Morning Sales:**
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and Evening Sales:**
   Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
   Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the rates at which Sandy and Joey lose weight.

1. First, determine Joey's weekly weight loss:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Using the rate of 0.5 pounds per week, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new limbs a person will grow after 15 days, given that they grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We can use the concept of least common multiples (LCM) to find a common period for both the arm and leg growth cycles.

1. **Determine the growth cycles:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - Legs grow every 5 days.

2. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5:**
   - The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, which means every 15 days, both the arm and leg growth cycles will align.

3. **Calculate the number of new arms in 15 days:**
   - Since an arm grows every 3 days, in 15 days, the number of new arms is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

4. **Calculate the number of new legs in 15 days:**
   - Since a leg grows every 5 days, in 15 days, the number of new legs is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

5. **Sum the total number of new limbs:**
   - Total new limbs = Number of new arms + Number of new legs
   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption and then extend that to a weekly total.

First, let's break down the daily consumption:
- Three family members each eat 3 eggs per day. Therefore, the total eggs consumed by these three members is:
  \[
  3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
  \]
- The remaining two family members each eat 2 eggs per day. Therefore, the total eggs consumed by these two members is:
  \[
  2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
  \]

Next, we add the eggs consumed by both groups to find the total daily consumption:
\[
9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
\]

Now, to find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( T \) represent Trent's age.
2. Let \( J \) represent Jane's age.
3. Let \( Q \) represent Quinn's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane: \( T = J + 5 \)
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: \( J = Q - 3 \)
- Quinn is 30 years old: \( Q = 30 \)

First, substitute \( Q = 30 \) into the second equation to find Jane's age:
\[ J = 30 - 3 \]
\[ J = 27 \]

Next, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the first equation to find Trent's age:
\[ T = 27 + 5 \]
\[ T = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into equations and solve them step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
   - Let \( C \) be Cera's current age.
   - Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.

2. **Given information:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old: \( C = 46 \).
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was \( N - 6 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera:
     \[
     N - 6 = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N - 6 = 20 \implies N = 26
     \]
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age:
     \[
     \text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000
     \]
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now:
     \[
     60000 = \frac{P}{2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( P \):
     \[
     P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
3. The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can write the equation for the total number of players as:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, considering both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the addition of cream. 

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Account for the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables and the relationships:

- Let \( x \) be the number of old records brought in by the 5 people.
- According to the problem, 2 old records are traded for 1 new record.

The key information is that 5 people leave with 7 new records. Therefore, the relationship between the old records and the new records can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

This equation states that the number of old records divided by 2 (since 2 old records are needed for 1 new record) equals the number of new records, which is 7.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 7 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total monthly salary paid to all the programmers in the company. We'll start by breaking down the information given:

1. **Total number of employees**: 100
2. **Number of junior programmers**: \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees
3. **Monthly salary of a junior programmer**: $2000
4. **Monthly salary of a senior programmer**: $400 more than a junior programmer

First, let's calculate the number of junior programmers:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the number of senior programmers:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Now, we determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:
\[
\text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

We then calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Next, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, we find the total monthly salary for all programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of people on the bus at each stop and determine the initial number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. The number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Eating on the Way to School:**
   He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]

3. **Passing Lollipops to Friends:**
   He passes 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

4. **Buying More Lollipops:**
   He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]

5. **Eating Lollipops at Night:**
   He eats 3 lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]

6. **Eating Lollipops in the Morning:**
   He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.

"To calculate the time required to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first determine the remaining percentage of charge needed:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required in minutes is:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for both jobs after accounting for all applicable taxes and deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given conditions.

Let \( x \) represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups. According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the equal groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cows and \( h \) represent the number of chickens.

1. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   c + h = 60
   \]

2. There are twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   h = 2c
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( c \):

\[
c + 2c = 60
\]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):

\[
3c = 60
\]
\[
c = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( c = 20 \) back into the second equation to find \( h \):

\[
h = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
  \[
  20 \times 4 = 80
  \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80
  \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:

\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

3. Let \( G \) represent the weight of the green toad.
4. Let \( Y \) represent the weight of the yellow snake.
5. Let \( R \) represent the weight of the red bird.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P = B \)
2. \( P = G \)
3. \( P = Y - 10 \)
4. \( P = R + 20 \)
5. \( P = 50 \) pounds

Using the given weight of the pink frog, we can substitute \( P = 50 \) into the other equations to find the weights of the other animals:

1. \( B = 50 \) pounds
2. \( G = 50 \) pounds
3. \( 50 = Y - 10 \) → \( Y = 60 \) pounds
4. \( 50 = R + 20 \) → \( R = 30 \) pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = \( 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \) pounds

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on vacation. We know the following:

1. John spent 6 hours boating.
2. He spent half that time swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. He watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so the total time spent watching shows is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

Adding these times together gives us the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We are told that these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( M \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- \( S \) be the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
- \( V \) be the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
- \( O \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( M = 3 \)
2. \( S = 4M - 5 \)
3. \( V = 3S \)
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50, so \( M + S + V + O = 50 \)

First, substitute \( M = 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 7 \) into the equation for \( V \):
\[ V = 3(7) = 21 \]

Now, we have the values for \( M \), \( S \), and \( V \):
- \( M = 3 \)
- \( S = 7 \)
- \( V = 21 \)

Substitute these values into the total equation:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50 \]

Simplify and solve for \( O \):
\[ 31 + O = 50 \]
\[ O = 50 - 31 \]
\[ O = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points as \( E \).

According to the problem:
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).
- Sara has 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

Next, solve for \( E \) by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, her total cost is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which allows him to ride all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount of money David saves is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate the savings Tim makes by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is:
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With a 20% discount, the total cost for both services is:
     \[
     20 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings are:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services."
"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each task:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all times to the same unit (minutes):**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
   - Recording the song: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( E \) represent Erica's age.
2. Let \( B \) represent Beth's age.
3. Let \( A \) represent Alice's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Erica is 30 years old, so \( E = 30 \).
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so \( B = E + 5 \).
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so \( A = B + 7 \).

First, substitute \( E = 30 \) into the equation for Beth's age:
\[ B = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 35 \) into the equation for Alice's age:
\[ A = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

"To determine the energy savings when Mel reduces the usage of a 900-watt air conditioner by 5 hours a day over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original daily energy consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption after reducing usage:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original daily consumption and the new daily consumption:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}

"To determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we need to consider the probabilities of these two independent events.

1. The probability that a candle will explode is 1% (since the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode):
   \[
   P(\text{Explode}) = 0.01
   \]

2. The probability that a candle, given it is one of the more dangerous ones (i.e., it explodes), will also smell like wet dog is 5%:
   \[
   P(\text{Smell like wet dog} \mid \text{Explode}) = 0.05
   \]

3. To find the probability that a candle both explodes and smells like wet dog, we multiply these probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{Explode and Smell like wet dog}) = P(\text{Explode}) \times P(\text{Smell like wet dog} \mid \text{Explode}) = 0.01 \times 0.05 = 0.0005
   \]

4. Now, we apply this probability to the total number of candles Marcy makes:
   \[
   \text{Number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = 0.0005 \times 50000 = 25

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( J_t \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( J_s \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( J_a \) as the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- \( S_t \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( S_s \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- \( S_a \) as the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( J_t = 30 \)
2. \( J_s = \frac{1}{2} J_t = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)
3. \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
4. \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
5. \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ J_a = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D = 180 - C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: 30% of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between the sizes of the lockers, which are given in terms of ratios.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To solve the problem, let's define the total number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5.

The total amount of money Kenny makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total money he makes is:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order, we first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of bags of chips George bought.
- Let \( y \) be the number of candy bars George bought.

We know the following:
1. George bought 3 bags of chips, so \( x = 3 \).
2. The cost of one bag of chips is 40 cents, or $0.40.
3. The cost of one candy bar is 75 cents, or $0.75.
4. George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money.

First, calculate the total amount George spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 5 \times 0.99 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ 0.40x + 0.75y = 4.95 \]

Since \( x = 3 \), substitute \( x \) into the equation:
\[ 0.40(3) + 0.75y = 4.95 \]
\[ 1.20 + 0.75y = 4.95 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 0.75y = 4.95 - 1.20 \]
\[ 0.75y = 3.75 \]
\[ y = \frac{3.75}{0.75} \]
\[ y = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs, the amount of hay it consumes, the cost of the hay, and finally, the change Michael has after purchasing the hay.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).
   - The horse runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.
   - Hay needed = Distance × Hay consumption rate
   - Hay needed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails of hay

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = Number of bails × Cost per bail
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5-dollar bills.
   - Total money = Number of bills × Value per bill
   - Total money = 6 bills × $5 per bill = $30

5. **Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost
   - Change = $30 - $24 = $6

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

"To determine the car's average speed over the entire trip, we need to use the concept of a weighted average, where the speeds are weighted by the time spent at each speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent at each speed:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weighted average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given conditions into a linear equation. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Thus, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 6 inches to feet:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the total number of books Sarah bought. Given that each book costs $15 and she spent a total of $300, we can calculate the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 books equally among her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child receives, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Thus, each child received 5 books.

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use a Venn diagram to visualize the sets and their intersections. 

1. Let's define the sets:
   - Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

2. We are given:
   - \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
   - \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
   - \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

3. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we can find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both:
   \[
   |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]

4. The total number of kids in the class is 32. To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both from the total number of kids:
   \[
   \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to perform two key calculations: one for the employees and one for the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups, and each group has 200 employees.
- Therefore, the total number of employees is \( 3 \times 200 = 600 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
- Total number of people = \( 600 + 21 = 621 \).

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"To solve this problem, we need to use our expertise in fractions and addition. We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

To find \(\frac{3}{4} \times 48\), we can break it down:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times \left(\frac{48}{4}\right) = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weights of both pennies to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of songs Luri has on his player. Given that Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has 3 times as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of songs each can add to their players, given that the media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Finally, we find the difference in the number of songs they can each add:
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of oranges Stetson ate and then calculate the total amount of money he gave up based on the number of oranges.

First, we find the fraction of the oranges Stetson ate:
\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats:
\[
\text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"To solve the problem of determining how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break it down into a series of arithmetic steps:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Daily consumption for one horse = 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - Daily consumption for four horses = 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - Total consumption for five days = 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Number of bags needed = 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the difference between the cost of the toy car and the child's current savings. The toy car costs $12, and the child has $4. 

Subtracting the savings from the cost:
$12 - $4 = $8

This means the child needs to save an additional $8. If the child saves $2 each day, we can find the number of days required by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts and promotions, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

We know that Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, in four years, Angela's age will be:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Thus, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To solve the problem of determining the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve this equation, we first isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 20:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found,
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found,
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) into the first equation:
\[ L + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ L + 3D = 43 \]

Now, substitute \( L = D + 7 \) into the equation \( L + 3D = 43 \):
\[ (D + 7) + 3D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a series of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the width of the chair.
2. Let \( R \) represent the width of the rug.
3. Let \( L \) represent the length of the couch.

From the problem, we know:
- The chair is 3 feet wide, so \( C = 3 \).
- The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so \( R = C + 5 \).
- The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so \( L = 2R + 2 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to use multiplication and subtraction. First, we calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly pass, and then we subtract the cost of the weekly pass to find the savings.

1. Calculate the total number of bus trips Janet takes in a week:
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
   - She takes these trips 5 days a week.
   - Total bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

2. Calculate the total cost of these bus trips:
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - Total cost per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week.

3. Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

4. Calculate the savings by buying the weekly bus pass:
   - Savings = Total cost of bus trips without the pass - Cost of the weekly bus pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

2. **Calculate the number of cows in the zoo:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
   - Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

3. **Calculate the number of sheep on the farm:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
   - Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

4. **Calculate the total number of animals on the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep.
   - Total animals on the farm: \(30 + 10 = 40\).

5. **Calculate the total number of animals in the zoo:**
   - The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep.
   - Total animals in the zoo: \(60 + 20 = 80\).

6. **Calculate the combined total number of animals:**
   - Total animals on the farm: 40
   - Total animals in the zoo: 80
   - Combined total: \(40 + 80 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo combined is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the ratio of the quantities of onions and potatoes bought by Rose and Sophia.

Given:
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote:
- The number of onions Sophia bought as \( x \).
- The number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( y \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Now, we solve these equations for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. Solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

2. Solve for \( y \):
\[ 4y = 4 \]
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ y = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 pounds by his birthday on July 19th, Andy needs to establish a consistent daily calorie deficit. Here’s how we can calculate it:

1. **Determine the total number of days:**
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot and \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( H + L = 120,000 \)
2. \( H = 3L \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we use the number of chairs Ophelia has to find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we use the number of chairs Jenna has to find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the cost of the computer,
- \( M \) as the cost of one monitor,
- \( P \) as the cost of the printer.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.
3. The computer costs $1,100.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. \( C = 1100 \)

First, substitute the value of \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 \]
\[ P = 700 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."

2. **Calculate the number of shells each girl brought back:**
   According to the problem, each girl brought back the number of shells each boy brought plus four times that amount. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Shells per girl} = \text{Shells per boy} + 4 \times \text{Shells per boy}
   \]
   Substituting the number of shells each boy brought:
   \[
   \text{Shells per girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60
   \]
   First, perform the multiplication:
   \[
   4 \times 60 = 240
   \]
   Then, add the result to the number of shells each boy brought:
   \[
   60 + 240 = 300
   \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, George ate 5 candies and now has 3 candies left. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. The problem also states that Nick had twice as many candies as George. Therefore, the number of candies Nick has is:

\[ 2 \times G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Thus, Nick has 16 candies.

"To determine Anne's age, we start by identifying the ages of Chenny and Alyana. Chenny is 10 years old. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from 10 to find Alyana's age:

10 - 4 = 6

Alyana is 6 years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age:

6 + 2 = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we will use addition and multiplication, as these operations are fundamental to solving this problem.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first add up the vlogs she has already completed:

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Next, we subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, start by determining the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Next, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the bill is split evenly, each person would normally pay half of the original $50:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, you are responsible for the entire tip, so you need to add the tip to your half of the bill:

$25 + $10 = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of operations step by step:

1. **Initial Share**: The total amount of $18 is shared equally among 3 boys. Each boy receives:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Addition of $5**: The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Addition of $10**: The following day, he adds another $10:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Spending $8**: He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Tripling the Amount**: After spending, he triples the amount he has left:
   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the daily savings amount for the second half of April, given that Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half of April is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total savings for each half of the month:**
   - April has 30 days, so the first half has 15 days and the second half has 15 days.
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

3. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

4. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

5. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up a simple linear equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now that we know Brad gets 20 dollars, we can find out how much Jeff gets by calculating \( 4B \):
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into steps and use addition and multiplication to find the solution.

1. Elise writes the full alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so:
   \[
   26 \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written:
   \[
   52 + 13 = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]

4. Rewriting all 65 letters again means:
   \[
   65 \text{ letters}
   \]

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[
52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The reading rate is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \).
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Shiloh's age and his nephew's age using the information provided.

Let \( N \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

We know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

First, we express Shiloh's age in 7 years:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

Next, we express the nephew's age in 7 years:
\[ N + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

- \( M \) for the number of goals Mark scored,
- \( A \) for the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
3. Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

First, we substitute \( R = 80 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, we substitute \( R = 80 \) into the second equation to find \( A \):
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we have the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual scores:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
175"

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to break down his spending over the week and calculate the number of action figures he buys each day.

1. **Calculate the daily spending:**
   - Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
   - Daily spending = Total amount / Number of days = $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

2. **Calculate the spending on wooden action figures:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures.
   - Number of days = 4.
   - Total spent on wooden action figures = 4 days * $10/day = $40.
   - Each wooden action figure costs $5.
   - Number of wooden action figures = Total spent on wooden action figures / Cost per wooden action figure = $40 / $5 = 8 figures.

3. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Initial amount = $70.
   - Amount spent on wooden action figures = $40.
   - Remaining amount = $70 - $40 = $30.

4. **Calculate the spending on plastic action figures:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures.
   - Number of days = 3.
   - Total spent on plastic action figures = 3 days * $10/day = $30.
   - Each plastic action figure costs $2.
   - Number of plastic action figures = Total spent on plastic action figures / Cost per plastic action figure = $30 / $2 = 15 figures.

5. **Calculate the total number of action figures:**
   - Total action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures = 8 + 15 = 23 figures.

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it with the number of roses Ford can supply each month.

First, let's find out the total number of roses required by the flower shops each week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Next, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops each month. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month:
Total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

Now, let's determine how many roses Ford can supply each month:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- Total roses Ford can supply per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

Finally, we need to find out how many roses Ford lacks to meet the demand:
Roses Ford lacks = Total roses required per month - Total roses Ford can supply per month
Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the correct setting to achieve a desired temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by a consistent percentage.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting:

1. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
2. The difference is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the durations into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the duration of each movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the total for the first movie is:
  \[
  60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the total for the second movie is:
  \[
  120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we add the total minutes of both movies:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

- \( d \) as the number of dishes Judy bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. Judy bought a dozen cups, so \( c = 12 \).
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so \( d = 2c \).

Substituting \( c = 12 \) into the second equation:
\[ d = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

So, Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes.

Next, we know:
- Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
- Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy.

So, the number of dishes Judy's friend brought is:
\[ d_{\text{friend}} = d + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:
- Total cups: \( 12 + 40 = 52 \)
- Total dishes: \( 24 + 44 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by both is:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

The total number of utensils brought by the two is:

"To solve this problem, we will use multiplication and addition to determine the earnings of John and Jill, and then find the difference between their earnings.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans,
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans,
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[ R = 0.99B \]

2. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[ G = 1.01B \]

3. The total number of jelly beans is 4500:
   \[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) into the total equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the beanstalk. The beanstalk doubles its height every day, starting from an initial height of 4 feet. We can express the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) using the formula:

\[ \text{Height on day } n = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the height of the beanstalk is greater than 20 feet. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, divide both sides of the inequality by 4:

\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Next, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \): \( 2^0 = 1 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 2^1 = 2 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \) (greater than 5)

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To solve this problem, we need to use ratios and multiplication effectively. Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can set up a ratio to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms.

First, let's determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:
- The ratio of protein to weight in mushrooms is 3 grams of protein per 100 grams.
- For 200 grams, we multiply the ratio by 2 (since 200 grams is twice 100 grams):
  \[
  3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week:
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, which provides 6 grams of protein per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:
  \[
  6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week}
  \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Next, we simplify and solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, let's first convert all his coins into their cent values and then sum them up.

- **Quarters:** Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters, so:
  \[ 8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents} \]

- **Dimes:** Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes, so:
  \[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

- **Nickels:** Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels, so:
  \[ 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

- **Pennies:** Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies, so:
  \[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we add up all the cents:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ 345 \div 5 = 69 \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine the total number of legs for the pets in the store, we will use multiplication and addition. Here’s the breakdown:

- Each dog has 4 legs. With 5 dogs, the total number of legs for the dogs is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs. With 2 cats, the total number of legs for the cats is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs. With 10 birds, the total number of legs for the birds is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Now, we add the legs together:

\[20 \text{ (dog legs)} + 8 \text{ (cat legs)} + 20 \text{ (bird legs)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Thus, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48."
"To determine the final weight Jamaal uses, we first calculate the 50% increase of the 8-pound weight. 

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is the distance divided by the speed, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the individual rates at which Ruiz and Marissa can make chocolates, and then use these rates to find the total amount of chocolates they can produce together in 12 hours.

1. **Calculate Ruiz's rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's rate is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate Marissa's rate:**
   - Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa's rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of chocolates made by both in 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's total production in 12 hours:
     \[
     60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa's total production in 12 hours:
     \[
     90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Combined total production:
     \[
     720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

**First Four Hours:**
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Earnings per hour: \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Total earnings for four hours: \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

**Next Two Hours:**
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Earnings per hour: \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Total earnings for two hours: \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

**Total Earnings:**
- Sum of earnings from both periods: \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to use proportional reasoning and unit conversions to determine how many years it will take for the tires to need replacement based on the given data.

First, let's establish the relationship between the distance driven and the number of tire rotations:
- Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.

Next, we need to find out how many rotations occur in 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations per 400 miles} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Jeremy drives 400 miles each month, so the number of rotations per month is 145,000.

To find the number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Each tire can undergo a maximum of 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many years it will take to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of $50.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**

A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of $50.**

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ 8 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the height requirement to inches:**
   The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement in inches is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the current height and the additional height needed:**
   Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many more inches he needs to grow to meet the height requirement, we subtract his current height from the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years required to grow the additional height:**
   Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate James's earnings from his job selling used cars, we need to follow a structured approach to determine the profit and his commission.

1. **Calculate the total sales amount:**
   - James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Determine the total acquisition cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   - James's commission is 10% of the profit.
   - James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the concept of relative speed and the relationship between distance, speed, and time.

Given:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference in their speeds:
\[
\text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we use the relative speed to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap. The formula for time is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10. 

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

First, calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Jewel's weekly production is:
     \[
     50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

2. **Determine Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes:
     \[
     2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day}
     \]

3. **Determine Julie's weekly production:**
   - Julie processes 100 customers per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Julie's weekly production is:
     \[
     100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we need to convert 24 whole eggs to dozens.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we first need to calculate how many pages she has already completed. Given that she has finished 1/3 of a 15-page paper, we can find this by multiplying 15 by 1/3:

\[ 15 \times \frac{1}{3} = 5 \]

This means Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To solve this problem, we need to use division to find out how many days it will take Mike to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day. Then, we will use subtraction to determine how many days before the deadline he will finish.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike reads per day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we subtract the number of days it takes Mike to read the book from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to break down the costs and then sum them up.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- **Monthly Maintenance Cost**: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- **Annual Maintenance Cost**: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total Cost for the First Year**: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( R \) be the time it takes to cook rice.
2. Let \( P \) be the time it takes to cook pork.
3. Let \( B \) be the time it takes to cook beans.

From the problem, we know:
- \( R = 30 \) minutes (time to cook rice)
- \( P = R + 20 \) (pork takes 20 more minutes than rice)
- \( B = \frac{1}{2} (R + P) \) (beans take half the combined time of rice and pork)

First, substitute \( R = 30 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, substitute \( R = 30 \) and \( P = 50 \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2} (30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[ R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the Coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of $5 is calculated as: \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs: \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.
   - Roger buys 7 pounds of coffee (1 pound per day for 7 days).
   - The total cost for the coffee is: \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the Donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

3. **Total Cost:**

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of history teachers and then determine the number of math teachers. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

Next, we find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ \text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Aurelia has.
2. Let \( K \) represent the amount of money Kassidy has.
3. Let \( R \) represent the amount of money Rayna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Aurelia has $120, so \( A = 120 \).
- Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, so \( K = \frac{3}{4}A \).
- Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so \( R = K + 60 \).

First, substitute \( A = 120 \) into the equation for \( K \):
\[ K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, substitute \( K = 90 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts for each person:
- Aurelia: \( A = 120 \)
- Kassidy: \( K = 90 \)
- Rayna: \( R = 150 \)

To find out how much each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we first calculate the total amount of money:
\[ \text{Total} = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Then, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the amount each person would have:
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

Thus, each person would have 120 dollars if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches:**
   - The current height of the bamboo is 20 feet.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the current height in inches is:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the total growth needed:**
   - The desired height is 600 inches.
   - The growth needed is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( K \) for the number of cookies Katarina has,
- \( M \) for the number of cookies Max has,
- \( C \) for the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has,
- \( S \) for the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
4. Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   K = 68
   \]

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation:
\[
68 = M - 5
\]
Solving for \( M \):
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation:
\[
73 = C + 12
\]
Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):
1. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 1.5L = 120 \]

2. Divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To calculate the total time Chris took to mow his lawn using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we can use the concept of weighted averages of time intervals. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the time to mow the entire lawn in each mode:**
   - ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
   - ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

2. **Calculate the time to mow half of the lawn in each mode:**
   - Half of the lawn in ""Turtle"" mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes
   - Half of the lawn in ""Rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

3. **Sum the times for both halves:**
   - Total time = Time in ""Turtle"" mode + Time in ""Rabbit"" mode

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Next, we simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we have \( R = 6 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( T \):
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

John has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together:
20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this time into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Subtracting the total homework time from the time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( L \) represent the cost of one lollipop and \( C \) represent the cost of one candy.

From the problem, we know:
1. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
2. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

We can write the first equation based on the total cost:
\[ 5L + 4C = 3.20 \]

We are also given that each lollipop costs $0.40, so:
\[ L = 0.40 \]

Substituting \( L = 0.40 \) into the first equation:
\[ 5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20 \]
\[ 2.00 + 4C = 3.20 \]

Next, we solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4C = 1.20 \]
\[ C = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ C = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. Using the values of \( L \) and \( C \):
\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10L = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10C = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

First, let's calculate Rong's monthly savings:
- Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we calculate Neil's monthly savings:
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
- The additional amount Neil saves is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.
- Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

Now, we calculate the total savings over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings: \( 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \).
- Neil's total savings: \( 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \).

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil:
- Combined total savings: \( 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \).

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The heartworm check cost is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - Amount left: \( 125 - 100 = 25 \) dollars.

Therefore, John leaves with 25 dollars."
"To determine the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit based on their individual prices and then sum these costs.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Next, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required and compare it to the number of chairs currently available at Mia’s restaurant.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs currently available
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of points each student has collected and then find out how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck in pounds.
2. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.
3. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul \( 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \) pounds.
4. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

We can write the equation for the total capacity as:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):
\[ 8,800 + G = 11,600 \]
\[ G = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ G = 2,800 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed. Given the cat's speed is 15 feet per second, we can set up the following proportion to find the turtle's speed:

\[ \text{Cat's speed} : \text{Turtle's speed} = 5 : 1 \]

Given:
\[ \text{Cat's speed} = 15 \text{ feet/second} \]

Let \( x \) be the turtle's speed in feet per second. The proportion can be written as:
\[ 15 : x = 5 : 1 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the proportion:
\[ 15 = 5x \]
\[ x = \frac{15}{5} \]
\[ x = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the fundraising goal of $6300, given that the amount raised per hour is consistent.

First, let's find the amount raised per hour:
- In the first 3 hours, they raised $2100.
- Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:
  \[
  \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
  \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
- The total goal is $6300.
- They have already raised $2100.
- The remaining amount needed is:
  \[
  \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}

"To determine Marcus' total bill, we first calculate the cost of each type of item he ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:

Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To determine the savings James made by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound: $2.5
   - Pounds: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, we first need to determine the time each takes individually.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog, being faster, takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time by summing the times and dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches and add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship provided in the problem: the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given relationship is:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) represent Dora's age, \( F \) represent Dora's father's age, and \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora is 15 years old: \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: \( F = 2D + 8 \).
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: \( M = F - 4 \).

First, substitute \( D = 15 \) into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, substitute \( F = 38 \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we will use addition and multiplication, as these operations are fundamental in calculating the combined weight of multiple items.

1. **Math and Science Books**: Each book weighs 2 pounds, and there are 2 books (one math and one science). Therefore, the total weight for these books is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **French Book**: The French book weighs 4 pounds. So, the weight is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **English Book**: The English book weighs 3 pounds. So, the weight is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **History Book**: The history book weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
   \[
   2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add the weights of all the books together to find the total weight:
\[
4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
Let \( C \) represent the number of books Clara has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Alice has 6 more books than Steven: \( A = S + 6 \)
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven: \( C = 2S \)
3. Clara has 20 books: \( C = 20 \)

First, we can use the third equation to find the number of books Steven has:
\[ C = 2S \]
\[ 20 = 2S \]
\[ S = 10 \]

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has using the first equation:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Each gallon jar costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon jar costs $3, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebra to find the number of students who like to play video games. We know the total number of students in the class is 50. Out of these, 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or play music. Additionally, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball.

First, let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

Next, let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \). The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play music, and play video games:
\[ 50 = 10 + 5 + 10 + V \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 50 = 25 + V \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \( 25 \).

"To calculate Mark's profit, we need to determine both his total expenses and his total revenue from selling the cards.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Expenses**
Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards, each costing $1800.
\[ \text{Total Expenses} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue**
Mark sells the cards as follows:
- One card worth $4000
- Another card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each

First, calculate the revenue from the 30 cards:
\[ \text{Revenue from 30 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Next, add the revenue from the other two cards:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Profit**
Profit is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, Mark's profit is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it.

We know two things:
1. The total number of votes is 33.
2. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ F + A = 33 \]
\[ F = 2A \]

First, we substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( F \) using the second equation:
\[ F = 2A \]

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we start by understanding the given information:

- Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
- One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
- There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]

To solve for the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( T \) represent the total number of puppies. We can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times T = 18
\]

To solve for \( T \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\), which is \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system based on the given ratios and the total number of cases of shingles required.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote the price at which Bennet sells each ear of corn as \( x \).

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total revenue from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet also has 25 ears of corn, and he wants to make a total of $135. The revenue from the corn can be expressed as:
\[ 25x \]

The total revenue from both the eggplants and the corn should equal $135. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 60 + 25x = 135 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 25x = 135 - 60 \]
\[ 25x = 75 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 25:
\[ x = \frac{75}{25} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Thus, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \( \boxed{3} \) dollars."

"To calculate the total cost for Mike to replace his movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the collection into different categories and apply the appropriate costs.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie.
   - Cost of a normal movie: $10
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 1.67 = 333.33 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $333.33
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 333.33 + 800 + 2400 = 3533.33 \) dollars

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the problem into the distances covered by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they also hiked for 1.5 hours. Therefore, the time spent driving is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = \text{Driving Speed} \times \text{Driving Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Speed} \times \text{Hiking Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Driving Distance} + \text{Hiking Distance} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles."

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. Initially, Bob has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, totaling 7 fish.
2. Bob buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \) (the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish after the purchase)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. When two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds.

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Speed of the second car - Speed of the first car
   - Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 60 miles per hour = 10 miles per hour

2. **Calculate the distance the second car will gain on the first car in 2 hours:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Relative speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles per hour × 2 hours = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the combined cost of the diamond and the gold. 

- The cost of the diamond is $600.
- The cost of the gold is $300.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of the materials:
\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. 

- 30% of $900 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find the final amount James paid:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the weighted average of the pass rates for each grade. This involves summing the number of students who passed in each grade and dividing by the total number of students.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade's pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40, so the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80. Therefore, 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

2. **Sum the number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Sum the total number of students:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine the initial amount of tea in gallons at the beginning of the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the tea consumed by both groups of students:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using addition and subtraction:

1. Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.
2. He sold 150 butterscotch candies. Since he only had 100, he needed to order more to fulfill the additional 50 sold.
3. Dale then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.

Now, let's calculate how many candies Dale has after these transactions:

- Initial candies: 100
- Candies sold: 150
- Additional candies ordered: 100

First, we determine how many candies Dale needed to fulfill the 150 sold:
- 150 sold - 100 initial = 50 additional candies needed

After ordering 100 more candies:
- 100 additional candies - 50 needed = 50 candies remaining

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

   - Additional students: \(320 - 10 = 310\)

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in a week, we can determine the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

Therefore, Felix climbs an average of 60 branches per day.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:

- \( z \) for the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- \( f \) for the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- \( s \) for the amount of salt in ounces.
- \( o \) for the amount of oil in ounces.
- \( u \) for the amount of sugar in ounces.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance: \( z = f \).
2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar: \( s = u \).
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).
4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).

We also know that the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + o + u = 10 \]

Using the relationships, we can substitute the variables:
- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \).
- Since \( s = u \), we can replace \( u \) with \( s \).
- Since \( s = 2z \), we can replace \( s \) with \( 2z \).
- Since \( o = 2s \), we can replace \( o \) with \( 2(2z) = 4z \).

Substituting these into the total volume equation, we get:
\[ z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( 4 \) ounces.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of Magic Cards that PJ has as \( P \), the number of cards that Smendrick has as \( S \), and the number of cards that Becca has as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of cards is 341.
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + S + B = 341 \)
2. \( B = S + 12 \)
3. \( S = 3P \)

First, we substitute the third equation \( S = 3P \) into the second equation \( B = S + 12 \):
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Next, we substitute both \( S = 3P \) and \( B = 3P + 12 \) into the first equation \( P + S + B = 341 \):
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we have \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[ S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ B = 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine how much money Roy has, we start by understanding the relationships and values given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.

First, calculate Anthony's savings:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can break down the journey into two segments and use multiplication and addition to find the solution.

1. For the first segment, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance for this segment is calculated as:
   \[
   8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second segment, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. The distance for this segment is:
   \[
   8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both segments:
   \[
   32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between distance, rate (speed), and time. The formula that connects these three is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. We can assume the distance across the highway is \( D \) miles. Since 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours to travel this distance, the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( D \) miles. The speed of one kangaroo is \( S \) miles per hour.

The total distance traveled by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is:
\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = D \]
\[ 54S = D \]
\[ S = \frac{D}{54} \]

Now, each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). The total speed of 4 turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27} \]

Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \), the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( K \) represent the number of dishes Kora made.
- \( R \) represent the number of dishes Rory made.
- \( J \) represent the number of dishes Jada made.

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes.
   \[
   K = 20
   \]
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   \[
   R = K + 20
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   \[
   J = 2R
   \]

First, substitute \( K = 20 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 20 + 20 = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[
J = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in, the contributions from her part-time job and her mom, and the additional amount she still needs.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine the number of apple slices left, we start by calculating the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

First, we calculate the slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding these together gives us the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current daily milk production:

- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- The farmer has 3 cows, so the current daily production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.

Next, we find out how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters:

- The target is 25 liters a day.
- The current production is 15 liters a day.
- The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

- \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800, we first add the costs of these items:

- Cost of the car: $10,000
- Cost of the phone: $800
- Total cost: $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

Next, we add the amounts of money Gabriel already has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5,000
- Money from his brother: $200
- Total money Gabriel has: $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost:

- Total cost: $10,800
- Total money Gabriel has: $5,200
- Money still needed: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S_J \) as the number of socks Jack has.
- \( D_J \) as the number of dishes Jack has.
- \( S_P \) as the number of socks Peter has.
- \( D_P \) as the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes:
   \[
   D_J = 60
   \]

2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks:
   \[
   D_J = 2S_J
   \]
   Substituting \( D_J = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 = 2S_J \implies S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
   \[
   S_P = 2S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
   \[
   D_P = \frac{D_J}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[
\text{Total socks} = S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total dishes} = D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90

"To solve the problem of determining how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can use our expertise in multiplication and division of fractions.

First, we need to find out how many rooms constitute one-half of the total 90 rooms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time required to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:
\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( y \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( z \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( x = y - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( x = z + 2 \)
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( m = 3y - 1 \)
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( x + y + z + m = 87 \)

First, we can express \( y \) and \( z \) in terms of \( x \):
- From \( x = y - 3 \), we get \( y = x + 3 \).
- From \( x = z + 2 \), we get \( z = x - 2 \).

Next, substitute \( y \) and \( z \) into the equation for \( m \):
- \( m = 3y - 1 = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

Now, substitute \( y \), \( z \), and \( m \) into the sum equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

Therefore, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then determine how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

"To model the exponential growth of the infection, we can use a discrete time step approach where each day represents a step. The initial number of infected people is 10, and each infected person infects 6 others every day. This can be represented by the formula:

\[ I_{n+1} = I_n + 6 \times I_n \]

where \( I_n \) is the number of infected people at day \( n \).

Let's calculate the number of infected people for each day:

**Day 0:**
- Initial infected people: \( I_0 = 10 \)

**Day 1:**
- New infections: \( 6 \times I_0 = 6 \times 10 = 60 \)
- Total infected people: \( I_1 = I_0 + 60 = 10 + 60 = 70 \)

**Day 2:**
- New infections: \( 6 \times I_1 = 6 \times 70 = 420 \)
- Total infected people: \( I_2 = I_1 + 420 = 70 + 420 = 490 \)

"To determine the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we calculate Julieta's tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

1520"
"To solve this problem, we need to subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges Jennifer had. 

1. Jennifer initially had 12 oranges.
2. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges.
3. She also gave 3 oranges to her only boy.

Now, we add the oranges given to her daughters and her boy:
6 (daughters) + 3 (boy) = 9 oranges.

Finally, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the rates at which Claire, Amber, and Wendy earn badges.

1. **Claire's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of yellow cars.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red cars.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of green cars.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue cars.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow cars.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - The rink has 12 red cars: \( R = 12 \).
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars: \( G = R - 2 \).
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars: \( B = 3G \).
   - The total number of cars is 75: \( R + G + B + Y = 75 \).

3. **Substitute the known values into the equations:**
   - From \( R = 12 \), we have \( G = 12 - 2 = 10 \).
   - From \( G = 10 \), we have \( B = 3 \times 10 = 30 \).

4. **Substitute \( R \), \( G \), and \( B \) into the total number of cars equation:**
   \[
   12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of books Sofie has,
- \( A \) as the number of books Anne has,
- \( F \) as the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of glasses of lemonade sold and the number sold by Julie. The total is 32 glasses, and Julie sold 14 glasses. The remaining glasses were sold equally by Micah and Mitchell.

First, we calculate the number of glasses sold by the boys:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (glasses sold by Julie) = 18 glasses sold by the boys.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by each boy.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:
14 (glasses sold by Julie) - 9 (glasses sold by Micah) = 5.

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Let's denote her current age by \( x \).

The equation representing this information is:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

4. **Outdoor plants**: Two-thirds of the remaining plants
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

5. **Flowering plants**: The rest of the remaining plants
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

6. **Percentage of flowering plants**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To solve for the speed of a whirligig, we start by understanding the proportional relationships given:

1. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
2. A whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob.
3. The speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second.

First, let's determine the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of a whatchamacallit} = 11 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

Given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can solve for the speed of a thingamabob:

\[ 121 = 11 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig. Since a whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

Substituting the speed of a thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \), the cost of the salad as \( s \), and the cost of the yogurt as \( y \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The cost of the salad \( s = 6 \) dollars.
2. The cost of the yogurt \( y \) is half the cost of the salad, so \( y = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two carrots, one salad, and one yogurt is $11.

We can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 2c + s + y = 11 \]

Substituting the known values of \( s \) and \( y \) into the equation:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2c = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ c = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is \( \boxed{1} \) dollar."

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

1. **First Week:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.

2. **Second Week:**
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment of $6 is for all the work done.
   - The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha's total earnings from all activities (lemonade sales and mowing lawns) is $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.

We can set up the following equation for her total earnings:
\[ 6 + L = 80 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 80 - 6 \]
\[ L = 74 \]

However, this calculation assumes that the $6 is the total payment for all the lawns mowed. Given that the problem states Joe paid $6, and we need to find the total earnings from mowing lawns, we need to consider the rate per lawn. If Joe paid $6 for \( J \) times, then the rate per lawn is \( \frac{6}{J} \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 9J \times \frac{6}{J} = 54 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

2. **Carl's Weight**: Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin. Therefore, Carl's weight is:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
3. **Christian's Weight**: Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl. Therefore, Christian's weight is:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. **Harry's Weight**: Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian. Therefore, Harry's weight is:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha originally had. According to the problem, Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed and then add it to the distance Dijana rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

First, let's find 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

   - Denise: 10 pages
   - Daniel: 13 pages

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise: 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday
     - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel: 0 pages today

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

4. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - \(28 - 13 = 15\)

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the amount of soup and the number of bowls it can fill, both for adults and children. 

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means that 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.

2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. Therefore, the total amount of soup used by Calvin and his wife is:
   - 2 adult bowls

3. Converting the adult bowls to child bowls:
   - 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls

4. The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After Calvin and his wife have their dinner, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls

5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To solve the problem of determining how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can set up a system of equations based on the given ratios.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the amount of material needed for one small mask.
- Let \( y \) be the amount of material needed for one large mask.

From the problem, we know:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, so \( 4x = 2 \).
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, so \( 3y = 2.25 \).

We can solve these equations to find \( x \) and \( y \):

1. Solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 2 \]
\[ x = \frac{2}{4} \]
\[ x = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} \]

2. Solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 2.25 \]
\[ y = \frac{2.25}{3} \]
\[ y = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of material required for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards

Adding these together gives the total material needed:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to perform a series of additions and subtractions based on the given information.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we add up the total hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from 24 to find the free time:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To solve this problem, we'll translate the given information into a system of linear equations and then solve for the unknowns.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Duncan's current age is 60.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \)
2. \( D = 60 \)

First, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the first equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the total number of cups and how they are distributed. Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that 15 cups are used for cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups left for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

These 12 cups are distributed equally among the 3 rows. So, the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row is:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row} \]

Since each row contains equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups of mint tea per row} \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's break it down step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we start by calculating the distance each vehicle covered.

First, we calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, use the value of \( J \) to find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of boxes and then determine how many tables are required to accommodate all the boxes, given the capacity of each table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( M \) as Marcus's age,
- \( L \) as Leo's age,
- \( D \) as Deanna's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \).
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \).
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \).

First, substitute the value of \( D \) into the second equation:
\[ M = 26 - 5 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( M \) into the third equation:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To find \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 21 \times 2 = L \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From the second equation: \( A = B - 20 \)
- From the third equation: \( D = B - 10 \)

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To calculate the total sleep duration for Kim, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time she woke up early is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Subtracted from Sleep:**
   - Total time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the correct number based on the information that Courtney overstated the number by 20%.

If Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. According to the problem, 48 is 120% of \( x \) (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we have:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( J \), by Jason as \( X \), and by Jordan as \( D \).

1. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \( D = 2X \)
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \( X = 2J \)
3. Jason carried 2 balls: \( X = 2 \)

First, we substitute \( X = 2 \) into the second equation to find \( J \):
\[ X = 2J \]
\[ 2 = 2J \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Next, we substitute \( X = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ D = 2X \]
\[ D = 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now, we add up the number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ D + X + J = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for \( A \), \( S \), and \( X \).

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To calculate the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, taking into account the distances traveled in both directions.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as \( R \), Jerry has as \( J \), and Robert has as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of cherries is 60.
2. Robert has 30 cherries.
3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( R + J + B = 60 \)
2. \( B = 30 \)
3. \( B = R + 10 \)

First, substitute \( B = 30 \) into the third equation:
\[ 30 = R + 10 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 30 - 10 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( R = 20 \) into the first equation:
\[ 20 + J + 30 = 60 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

Now, we need to find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ B - J = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

4. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
   \[
   A_u = 15
   \]

Using these equations, we can find the values of \( A_s \) and \( G_u \):
\[
A_s = A_u - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
\]
\[
G_u = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

Now, we have the number of boxes sold each day:
- Saturday: \( G_s = 10 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_s = 11 \) boxes of apple pie
- Sunday: \( G_u = 15 \) boxes of gingerbread, \( A_u = 15 \) boxes of apple pie

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: \( G_s + G_u = 10 + 15 = 25 \) boxes
- Total apple pie: \( A_s + A_u = 11 + 15 = 26 \) boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 25 \) boxes * $6/box = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 26 \) boxes * $15/box = $390

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 150 + 390 = 540
\]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use and then determine how many bottles she will need.

First, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen used each day:
- Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She is outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

Next, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over the 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
- She is on vacation for 8 days.
- Therefore, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Now, let's determine how many 8-ounce bottles she will need:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
- She needs 32 ounces in total.
- Therefore, she will need \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To calculate the total cost of both the red and blue cars, we start by determining the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

The blue car costs $100. 

A 40% discount on the blue car is calculated as:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( E \) as Emil's current age.
- \( D \) as Emil's dad's current age.
- \( B \) as Emil's brother's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
   \[
   E = 19
   \]

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
   \]
   This equation accounts for the fact that in 5 years, Emil will be 24 and his dad will be \( D + 5 \).

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   \[
   24 = 2 (B + 5)
   \]
   This equation accounts for the fact that in 5 years, Emil will be 24 and his brother will be \( B + 5 \).

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the equation for Emil's dad:
\[
24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
48 = D + 5
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
D = 43
\]

Next, solve the equation for Emil's brother:
\[
24 = 2 (B + 5)
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
12 = B + 5
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
B = 7
\]

Now, we have the current ages:
- Emil's dad is 43 years old.
- Emil's brother is 7 years old.

The sum of their ages is:
\[
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to perform a series of additions and multiplications based on the information provided:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which can be calculated as:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads}
   \]
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which can be calculated as:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads}
   \]

Now, we add all the beads together:
\[
20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \text{ beads}
\]

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total weight of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by the weight of one serving.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   Joe caught half the amount he caught on Friday.
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total Catch:**
   Add the amounts from Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
   \[
   3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Number of Servings:**
   Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total catch by 3.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
   \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students remain after the football players leave:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are either cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the size of Sophie's boots, which is given as 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding their boot sizes and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

"To solve the problem of how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow a series of steps involving area, unit conversions, and cost calculations.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Determine the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to perform a series of multiplications and additions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend to fill all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00.

   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds.

2. **Calculate the soil used for the carnations:**
   - Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations: \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations:**
   - Total soil used: \( 12 + 15 = 27 \) pounds.

4. **Calculate the remaining soil:**
   - They start with a 30-pound bag of soil.
   - Remaining soil: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) pounds.

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate the amount she sets aside each month for shoes. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we calculate the total amount she sets aside in a year:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica sets aside $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

### Peeling the Shrimp
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
  \[
  \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Cooking the Shrimp
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
  \[
  \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
  \[
  \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Total Time
- The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
  \[
  \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to consider the cooling and warming rates over the specified periods:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we sum the total temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Again, with 12 months in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month. With 12 months in a year:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up and solve equations involving fractions and proportions. Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \]

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve this problem, we will use our expertise in addition and multiplication to determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve for Wilfred's age, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

From the total age of the children, we have:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives, given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as large as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is thus divided into \( 8x \) parts.

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total costs and then consider the revenue. However, since the question does not specify any revenue, we will focus on the total costs.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: 4

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 sessions = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 weeks = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:

480"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.
2. Let \( y \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars: \( 4x = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars: \( 7y = 56 \).

We can solve these equations individually to find \( x \) and \( y \).

First, solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 64 \]
\[ x = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( y \):
\[ 7y = 56 \]
\[ y = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ y = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[ x - y = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies to the initial population.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population:
\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of babies born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
\[
\text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
\[
\text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

**Step 4: Add the total number of babies to the initial population.**

The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of red sticks.
2. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue sticks.
3. Let \( Y \) represent the number of yellow sticks.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- There are 9 red sticks: \( R = 9 \)
- There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks: \( B = R + 5 \)
- The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks: \( Y = B - 3 \)

First, substitute the value of \( R \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, substitute the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
\[ R + B + Y = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is 34."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps, focusing on the fractions and the total capacity of the tank.

1. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet earns $10 per hour from wages.
   - She also earns $15 per hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. 

- The cost of 3 peaches at $0.50 each is \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\).
- The cost of 4 pears at $0.50 each is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\).
- The cost of 2 kiwis at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).
- The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She originally had 15 packs and kept 2 for herself, so the number of packs given away is:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces of sweets. Therefore, the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \]

Anne distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the compound interest formula:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of 3 to find the total growth over three years:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this growth factor by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and multiplication. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This gives us a ratio of pages to minutes, which is 3 pages per 10 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

We can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:

\[ 3x = 18 \times 10 \]

\[ 3x = 180 \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, we will use addition and subtraction to track the changes in the number of guests at the hotel throughout the day.

1. **Initial number of guests:** 100
2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests leave, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests leave, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   We add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Evening check-ins:** 7 more people check in after dinner, so we add 7 to 91:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, focusing on the ore mining capabilities of a single dwarf and then scaling up to 40 dwarves over a 30-day period.

1. **Determine the ore mined by a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves over 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then over 30 days, they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost, ensuring that the prices are proportional.

Given:
- 2 sandwiches for $3
- 4 sandwiches for $6

First, let's determine the cost per sandwich:
- For the first package: \( \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \)
- For the second package: \( \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \)

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent at $1.5, we can use this rate to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches.

Now, calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches:
\[ 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To solve this problem, we need to perform two primary operations: subtraction and division. 

First, we subtract the number of seats allocated for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for friends and family. 

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats for graduates is 950, and the number of seats for faculty is 300. 

\[ \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Next, we divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to determine how many tickets each graduate can distribute. 

\[ \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans and how many of each size Grandpa can eat. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - We know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - We know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To determine Melissa's hourly rate after expenses for her jury duty, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**
   Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Expenses:**
   Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Net Earnings:**
   Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings.
   \[
   \text{Net earnings} = 45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate Hourly Rate After Expenses:**
   Divide the net earnings by the total hours worked.
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour}
   \]

Thus, Melissa's hourly rate after expenses is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Richard to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle and drops the candy immediately, so no additional time is needed for the first bottle.
   - The total time is the time to move between all the bottles.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then determine how much money she has left from her initial $50.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11 \text{ per pound} = \$22
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is:
  \[
  3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18
  \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
  \[
  \$22 + \$18 = \$40
  \]

Finally, let's determine how much money Amor has left:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the amount of money she has left is:
  \[
  \$50 - \$40 = \$10
  \]

So, Amor will have \$10 left to buy meat.

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the opportunity cost of not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the opportunity cost of not working:**
   - Jim had a job paying $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and lost income:**
   - Total cost: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Total amount to earn: \( 300,000 \) dollars.
   - New income per year: \( 75,000 \) dollars.
   - Time to earn the total amount: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

"To calculate the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by determining the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we find the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this multi-step arithmetic word problem involving fractions, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - First, calculate one-fifth of Monday's letters: 
     \[
     \frac{425}{5} = 85
     \]
   - Then, add 17 to this amount:
     \[
     85 + 17 = 102
     \]
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - First, calculate twice Tuesday's letters:
     \[
     2 \times 102 = 204
     \]
   - Then, add 5 to this amount:
     \[
     204 + 5 = 209
     \]
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum the letters delivered on each day:
     \[
     425 + 102 + 209 = 736
     \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To determine the average loss Johnny's dad experienced over the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Next, we calculate the total net loss for the day:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race - Win in the second race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 - $11 = $10.5

Now, we find the average loss per race:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given conditions. Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

1. The second person took $80 more than the first person:
   \[
   y = x + 80
   \]

2. The third person took twice what the second person took:
   \[
   z = 2y
   \]

3. The total amount divided among the three people is $1920:
   \[
   x + y + z = 1920
   \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( y \) and \( z \) into the total amount equation:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1680
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = 420
\]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Total days = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. **Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x = 30 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to perform a series of calculations involving multiplication and division.

1. **Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:**
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. **Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:**
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. **Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:**
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Total food consumed per day = 360 grams/day.
   - Number of days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of slices Becky ate.
2. Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
3. Let \( S \) represent the number of slices Silvia ate.

From the problem, we know:
- Becky ate 10 slices: \( B = 10 \).
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: \( B = J + 3 \).
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: \( S = 2J \).

We can substitute \( B = 10 \) into the second equation to find \( J \):
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 2J \]
\[ S = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the time Betsy took to complete her part of the meal, and \( D \) represent the time Donovan took to complete his part.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part: \( B = D + 18 \)
2. The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes: \( B + D = 98 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( D \):

\[ (D + 18) + D = 98 \]

Simplify and combine like terms:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = D + 18 \]
\[ B = 40 + 18 \]
\[ B = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the given time into seconds and then use multiplication to find the total number of jellyfish created.

First, let's convert 4 hours into seconds:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

Next, we know that one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. So, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

Since we have 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5:
- 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider the entire journey, including the round trip he made when he realized he forgot something.

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time taken using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine the savings, we first calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. Given that she bought 10 bunches and each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]
Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 40
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 20

"To solve this problem using ratios and proportions, we start by setting up the relationship between the growth of the crocodile and the time it takes. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. We can express this as a ratio:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} \]

We need to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years. Let's denote the unknown growth in 13 years as \( x \) inches. We can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = \frac{x \text{ inches}}{13 \text{ years}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[ 8 \text{ inches} \times 13 \text{ years} = 4 \text{ years} \times x \text{ inches} \]

\[ 104 \text{ inches} \cdot \text{years} = 4 \text{ years} \times x \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 years to isolate \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{104 \text{ inches} \cdot \text{years}}{4 \text{ years}} \]

\[ x = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to perform two key calculations: the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

1. **Total bales produced by the farmer:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales produced is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Total bales picked up by the truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Bales left in the field:**
   - To find the number of bales left, subtract the total number of bales picked up from the total number of bales produced.
   - \( 30 - 18 = 12 \) bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the 6-hour day is 12.

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week.
2. Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.
3. Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
4. Add the extra learning time to the regular class time.
5. Convert the total minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week.**

John has 6 periods a day plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day. He goes to class for 5 days a week:

\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.**

Each class is 40 minutes long:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.**

John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Add the extra learning time to the regular class time.**

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours.**

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of a geometric sequence, where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. In this case, the height the ball reaches after each bounce is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height from the previous bounce.

1. **Initial height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial height \( h_0 \) is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **Height after the first bounce:**
   - The height after the first bounce \( h_1 \) is \( h_0 \times \frac{2}{3} \).
   - \( h_1 = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Height after the second bounce:**
   - The height after the second bounce \( h_2 \) is \( h_1 \times \frac{2}{3} \).
   - \( h_2 = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"To determine the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert the height to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given, using reverse percentages and logical steps.

1. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, the remaining meat was 270 kilograms.

2. The pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate represents the remaining half after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, the amount of meat was:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate represents the remaining half of the triceratops. This means that before the T-Rex ate, the total weight of the triceratops was:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how much paint is required and its cost.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area of all four walls = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

2. **Determine the amount of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The total number of remaining sodas is 8.
   - The number of remaining shaken sodas is 2.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of remaining sodas:
     \[
     P(\text{Shaken Soda}) = \frac{\text{Number of Shaken Sodas}}{\text{Total Number of Remaining Sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To express this probability as a percentage:
     \[
     P(\text{Shaken Soda}) \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add these distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Anna spent on each book. We know the following:

1. Anna's initial budget was $16.
2. She has $2 left in her budget.
3. She has already spent $4 before buying the books.
4. She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount.

First, let's find out how much Anna has spent in total. Since she started with $16 and has $2 left, she has spent:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent on the books. She had already spent $4 before buying the books, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times, given that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:

\[
255 \times x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Now, divide both sides by 255 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To determine how many more female fish than male fish Tate has, we need to perform a series of additions and subtractions.

First, let's add up the initial number of male and female fish:

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfish: 3
- Initial female goldfish: 5

Next, we add the fish that Tate buys:

- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfish: 2
- Additional female goldfish: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we sum the total number of male and female fish:

- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fish:

- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

"To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to complete their chores, we need to add the time each person spent on their respective tasks.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior spent 4 hours longer than Amalia doing the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we add the times together to find the total time:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph) for 2 hours.
   - Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip involves driving to his parents' house and back.
   - Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total monthly distance:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
   - Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

560"
"To solve this problem, we need to use multiplication and division effectively. 

First, we calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she plans to walk 10 miles each day, we multiply the number of miles per day by the number of days:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. To find out how far Brian will walk, we divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2:
\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break down the information and solve it step by step.

1. **Total toys required:** 400 toys.
2. **Number of workers:** 5.
3. **Shift duration:** 10 hours.
4. **Production rates of the first four workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
5. **Remaining toys needed after the shift:** 20 toys.

First, let's calculate the total production by the first four workers:

- **Production by the first two workers:**
  - Each worker produces 6 toys per hour.
  - Total production by these two workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

- **Production by the next two workers:**
  - Each worker produces 4 toys per hour.
  - Total production by these two workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

- **Total production by the first four workers:**
  - \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

Next, we know that by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all five workers by the end of the shift is:

- \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:

- \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

Finally, to find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

- Production rate of the fifth worker: \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationship between the weights of the dogs. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs, one that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog and another that is half the weight of Kory's dog.

First, we calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:
105"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the stickers.

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.
2. Kris kept 9 stickers for himself, so before giving 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
3. Kris received these 16 stickers from Luis. Since Kris received the remaining half of the stickers Luis had, Luis must have had \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) stickers before giving half to Kris.
4. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth. Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have had \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) stickers initially.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the Earth's circumference.

1. First, calculate half of the Earth's circumference:
   \[
   \text{Half of the Earth's circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. Next, determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, given that he flies 400 kilometers each day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}

2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

First, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
750 mph"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \).

From the problem, we know:
- Liam is currently 16 years old.
- Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
- Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age.

This gives us the equation:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
3. Let \( C \) represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Let \( S \) represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
   \[
   A = M
   \]

2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total equation:
\[
A + A + C + S = 56
\]
\[
2A + C + S = 56
\]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( C + S = 30 \)
2. \( C = S + 12 \)
3. \( 2A + C + S = 56 \)

First, solve the second equation for \( C \):
\[
C = S + 12
\]

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the first equation:
\[
(S + 12) + S = 30
\]
\[
2S + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2S = 18
\]
\[
S = 9
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( C = S + 12 \):
\[
C = 9 + 12
\]
\[
C = 21
\]

Next, substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into the third equation:
\[
2A + 21 + 9 = 56
\]
\[
2A + 30 = 56
\]
\[
2A = 26
\]
\[
A = 13
\]

Since \( A = M \), we have:
\[
M = 13
\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[
C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

2. **Calculate Their Combined Salary:**
   - Valerie's salary: $5000
   - Her brother's salary: $10000
   - Combined salary:
     \[
     5000 + 10000 = 15000

"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between distance, rate, and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's denote:
- \( r_b \) as Grandma's walking rate on the beach (in miles per minute).
- \( r_s \) as Grandma's walking rate on the sidewalk (in miles per minute).

From the problem, we know:
- Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

First, we calculate Grandma's walking rate on the beach:
\[ r_b = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk:
\[ r_s = 2 \times r_b = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{r_s} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60, given that she saves $4 each week.

First, let's calculate how much Jane has already saved over the past 8 weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by translating the given information into a linear equation. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) represents the number of marbles Bob currently has. To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, denoted as \( T_2 \), such that when mixed with the water from the first mug, the final temperature \( T_f \) is at least 40 degrees.

Given:
- The temperature of the water in the first mug, \( T_1 \), is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.
- The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in both cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many potatoes Gomer ate based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \)
   - So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed per scoop:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes
   - Calculation: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops
   - So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Set up the proportion to find the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - We need to find out how many potatoes (\( x \)) are needed for 18 scoops.
   - Set up the proportion: \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \)

4. **Solve the proportion:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
   \[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
   \[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

3. Adding the eggs from both periods gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
   \[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

4. To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):
   \[ 240 \, \text{eggs} \div 12 \, \text{eggs/dozen} = 20 \, \text{dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To solve for the number of blue jellybeans, we start by identifying the known quantities and using addition and subtraction to find the unknown.

1. We know there are 17 green jellybeans.
2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus. The total parts of the ratio (5 + 9) is 14. 

To find the number of men:
\[
\text{Number of men} = \left(\frac{5}{14}\right) \times 84 = 30
\]

To find the number of women:
\[
\text{Number of women} = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right) \times 84 = 54
\]

Next, we need to determine how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight:
\[
\text{Number of women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of individual sunflowers sold per day.
- \( y \) as the number of bouquets sold per day.

From the problem, we know:
1. Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
2. Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
3. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. \( 2x = 26 \) (since each individual sunflower costs $2)
2. \( 8y = 56 \) (since each bouquet costs $8)

First, solve for \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ 2x = 26 \]
\[ x = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

\[ 8y = 56 \]
\[ y = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Individual sunflowers sold per day: \( x = 13 \)
- Sunflowers in bouquets sold per day: \( 12y = 12 \times 7 = 84 \)

Total sunflowers sold per day:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then calculate the combined probability for both independent events.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. Since the events are independent, the combined probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
2. Let \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Jim collected 27 seashells: \( J = 27 \)
- Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos: \( J = C + 5 \)
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey: \( C = 2R \)

First, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]

Solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we know:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern and sum the fruits produced each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits (no production).
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, we substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the simplified equation:
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
Distribute and combine like terms:
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
Add 35 to both sides:
\[
6Y = 72
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
Y = 12
\]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) using the second equation:
\[
B = Y - 7
\]
\[
B = 12 - 7
\]
\[
B = 5
\]

Finally, we find \( R \) using the first equation:
\[
R = 4B
\]
\[
R = 4 \times 5
\]
\[
R = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use proportions to find the amount of red paint used.

1. The mural is half yellow, which means:
   \[
   \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, the total amount of paint for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the rest of the house:**
   The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

5. **Calculate the total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

The total area of the house is:
\[
3160

"To solve this problem, we can recognize that the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio.

Given:
- The first term \( a = 3 \) (the number of puffs on Monday).
- The common ratio \( r = 2 \) (each day, the number of puffs doubles).

We need to find the sum of the first 5 terms of this geometric sequence. The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence is:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \( n = 5 \), \( a = 3 \), and \( r = 2 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{1 - 2^5}{1 - 2} \]

First, calculate \( 2^5 \):
\[ 2^5 = 32 \]

Now, substitute back into the formula:
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{1 - 32}{1 - 2} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{-31}{-1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \times 31 \]
\[ S_5 = 93 \]

Therefore, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
93"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps, applying division, multiplication, and basic financial concepts.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To solve this multi-step word problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is:

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the piece of chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk each subsequent day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - The remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk for each subsequent day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we start by calculating the number of students who are on varsity.

First, we calculate the number of girls on varsity:
- There are 12 girls in total.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity:
- There are 12 boys in total.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
- Total students on varsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class:
- Total students in the class = 12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students.
- Total students not on varsity = 24 students - 7 students = 17 students.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then calculate what percentage this represents of James' total teeth.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps:
   \[ 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ teeth} \]

3. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
   \[ 4 + 11 = 15 \text{ teeth} \]

4. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[ 50\% \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age and \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we will carefully track the number of apples Newton has at each step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fall out of the tree.
2. Newton picks up both apples. He puts one in his pocket and throws the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first apple he picked up) + 5 (from the apples that fell) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picks up these 6 apples, puts all but one in his pocket, and throws the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the apples that fell) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picks up all 7 apples and puts them in his pocket.

Now, let's add up all the apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to make 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find the time \(t\) in hours such that the total number of snowballs made is 60.
   - Using the net rate, we set up the equation: \(12t = 60\)

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into a series of steps, focusing on the calculations involving percentages and multiplication.

1. **Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 = $60

2. **Determine the number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
   - Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10 = 20

3. **Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of Cost per bottle of scotch)
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30 = $90

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:**
   - Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
   - Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90 = $1800

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on everything:**
   - Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
   - Total amount spent = $600 + $1800 = $2400

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is $2400."
"To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps, focusing on the number of trees planted each day and then summing them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of trees planted on the first day.**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted on the second day.**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so the total for the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. The additional number of Lodgepole Pine trees is \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\). Therefore, the total for the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days.**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

**Step 4: Sum the total number of trees planted.**
- Total trees: \(50 + 90 = 140\)

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to find out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is needed for 80 meatballs. We know the following:

- Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
- He makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef are required to make 80 meatballs. We can set up the ratio:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ meatballs}}{1 \text{ pound of ground beef}} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{x \text{ pounds of ground beef}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we need to find out how much seasoning is required for 5 pounds of ground beef. We use the ratio:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}}{1 \text{ pound of ground beef}} = \frac{y \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}}{5 \text{ pounds of ground beef}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning} \]

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( b = 3c - 2 \)
2. \( c + b = 10 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c = 12
\]
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To determine the total cost for Karen, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

1. **Calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount:**
   - The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
   - The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
   - The total cost without the discount is:
     \[
     35 + 40 = 75
     \]
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:
     \[
     75 \times 0.20 = 15
     \]
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     75 - 15 = 60
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the nail art:**
   - Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers.
   - The cost per nail is $3.
   - The total cost for the nail art is:
     \[
     10 \times 3 = 30
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Karen would pay:**
   - Add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
     \[
     60 + 30 = 90

"To solve this problem, we can use linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of paintings each person has.

Let's define:
- \( K \) as the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) as the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) as the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of novels Regina wrote last year and the number she has written this year. We know that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. 

To find the total number of novels written this year, we can set up the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To isolate the number of novels this year, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[
   S + B = 116

   - 8 plants each need 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - 4 plants need \( \frac{1}{2} \) cup, and 8 plants need 1 cup.
   - The rest of the plants: \( 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \( 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \) cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

"To determine the total time it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the distance on land and the distance in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
3. **Distance in Water**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time for each segment:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both segments to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we will break down the problem into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, so \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption for each type of dog and then extend that to a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \( 5 \, \text{kg/dog/day} \times 3 \, \text{dogs} = 15 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \( 3 \, \text{kg/dog/day} \times 2 \, \text{dogs} = 6 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Now, we add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to get the total daily consumption:
- Total daily consumption = \( 15 \, \text{kg/day} + 6 \, \text{kg/day} = 21 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Finally, to find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
- Total weekly consumption = \( 21 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 147 \, \text{kg} \).

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, let's start by calculating the number of seeds in each type of sunflower.

1. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the number of seeds in a small sunflower is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
   \]

2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:
   \[
   0.5 \times 36 = 18
   \]
   Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives:
   \[
   36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
   \]

3. To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers, but he lost some

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of items on the lab bench:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information about Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Let's denote:
- \( v_A \) as Aaron's speed in miles per minute.
- \( v_V \) as Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
- \( d_A \) as the distance Aaron ran in miles.
- \( d_V \) as the distance Vanessa ran in miles.
- \( t_A \) as the time Aaron took to complete his part of the race in minutes.
- \( t_V \) as the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race in minutes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Vanessa ran 4 miles: \( d_V = 4 \).
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron: \( d_V = 2d_A \).
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes: \( t_A = 16 \).
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa: \( v_A = 2v_V \).

First, we can find the distance Aaron ran:
\[ d_V = 2d_A \]
\[ 4 = 2d_A \]
\[ d_A = 2 \]

Next, we use the time Aaron took to find his speed:
\[ t_A = \frac{d_A}{v_A} \]
\[ 16 = \frac{2}{v_A} \]
\[ v_A = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa:
\[ v_A = 2v_V \]
\[ \frac{1}{8} = 2v_V \]
\[ v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
\[ t_V = \frac{d_V}{v_V} \]
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} \]
\[ t_V = 4 \times 16 \]
\[ t_V = 64 \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of the radiator: $80
   - Labor cost: $150
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve the problem of determining how many chickens Farmer Brown has, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables:
- \( c \) represents the number of chickens.
- \( k \) represents the number of cows.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we can eliminate \( c \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person will get if 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, are shared equally among Henry and his 3 friends.

First, calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, divide the total number of slices by the number of people (4):
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
