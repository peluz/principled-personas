"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of eggs Janet has available for sale after using some for personal consumption. 

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs used daily is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Subtracting the eggs used from the total eggs laid gives us the number of eggs available for sale:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Each egg is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different segments of John's journey and calculate the distances accordingly.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled away from home: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \).
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered: \( 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home: \( 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \).

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Distance from home: \( 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \).

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the total number of vacuum cleaners:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

3. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

5. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. **Number of Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.
3. **Total Eggs in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. Therefore, the total time she has already spent hiking is:
\[ \text{Time Spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she must complete the entire 12-mile trail in 3 hours. Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she has is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - The remaining amount of orange drink is:
     \[

     \]
   - The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Determine the total amount of water in the final mixture:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is:
     \[
     9 \text{ liters (remaining orange drink)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple drink)} = 24 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is:
     \[

We know the cost of the first pair of high heels is \( $33 \).

The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = $66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

1. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\).
2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
5. Now, calculate Allen's current age:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the individual guesses and then find their mean.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent per day on all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the total time spent per day:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
- John has 10 dogs.

So, the total time per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent per week:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total time per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[
23

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.
2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends running each week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Average Speed**:
   - Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Post-it Notes Remaining**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of blue ties John bought. Given that he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the 7.5 pounds from the comic books, he still needs to remove:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to achieve the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationships given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

First, we determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - There are 200 Grade 5 students, and 2/5 of them are boys.
   - Number of boys = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\).

2. **Determine the number of girls:**
   - The total number of students is 200, and we have already calculated that 80 are boys.
   - Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120.

3. **Determine the number of girls in the Girl Scout:**
   - 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout.
   - Number of girls in the Girl Scout = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80\).

4. **Determine the number of girls not in the Girl Scout:**
   - Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scout.
   - Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = 120 - 80 = 40.

Thus, the number of girls not in the Girl Scout is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how many tomatoes are in each can.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. This means the initial volume of the tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce.

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume by the volume per can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
   - 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the initial number of potted plants:**
   Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   \[
   2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Add the new potted plants:**
   Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery.
   \[
   80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of plants given away:**
   Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family.
   \[
   1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants:**
   Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants.
   \[
   98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
   \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she initially bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars per board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars per board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

  5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total quantity used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, and the total amount of both combined is 120 units.

Let's denote the common factor by \( x \). Therefore, the amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons, and the amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups. The total amount can be expressed as:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the amount of sugar used by substituting \( x \) back into the expression for sugar:
\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles present on the first day. Given that each container holds 5 vehicles and there were 2 containers on the first day, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container still contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Let \( L \) represent Lylah's salary four years ago. Then:

\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we apply the 40% increase to Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

   - Therefore, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   - Add the hours from all the days together.

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the information provided:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table.

Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

After her husband's contribution, the total number of spoons Julia had is:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons left is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 \]

We know that after this, Julia had 12 spoons:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we first need to calculate the number of fish sausages. Given that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is:

38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44 fish sausages

Next, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total:

38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the cost of each item based on the given information:

1. **Cost of a pepper:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange is \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of item Dillon is buying:

1. **Total cost for 4 watermelons:**
   - \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.

2. **Total cost for 20 peppers:**
   - \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 10 oranges:**
   - \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the total costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on patients per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert the total time spent on patients to hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles.
   - Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage:
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

Thus, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:

First, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, calculate \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[

   \]

2. **Seagull's Consumption:**
   The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. **Pigeons' Consumption:**
   Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. **Raccoon's Consumption:**
   The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. **Ants' Consumption:**
   Ants carried off one fry.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. **Final Remaining Fries:**
   Five fries were left.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then extend it over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes over a period of 2 months. 

First, let's determine the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Next, we sum these monthly requirements to find the total monthly banana requirement:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total requirement for 2 months:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is similar to this scenario.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% every two months. This means the multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Periods:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of two-month periods in 36 months is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Periods}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.
- Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

\[ 106.12 \]

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the profit per bag, and then use the total profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Cost per bag**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and incurs a transportation cost of $2 per bag. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30. Therefore, the profit per bag is:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400. To find the number of bags sold, we use the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To determine how much each of the three friends paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by three.

1. **Cost of tickets**: The total cost for 3 tickets is $20.25.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, the cost of food is:
   \[
   20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]
3. **Cost of rides**: Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides. Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   33 \times 2 = 66
   \]

Next, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102

"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Thus, the total number of peaches John collects is 360.

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing the total weekly amount by 7 days:

\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

Given:
- The cost of a pencil is $1.20.
- The cost of an eraser is $0.30.

First, we calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

So, the cost of one pen is $1.50.

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:

\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's define the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount due.
- Principal amount: $2000
- Interest: 10% of $2000
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]
- Total amount due: 
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months.
- Monthly payment: $165
- Total payments over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance.
- Total amount due: $2200
- Total amount paid: $1980
- Remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias is:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 7 = 11 \text{ dahlias} \]

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 11 \text{ dahlias} = 15 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

"Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided:

1. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

2. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To solve this problem, we start by noting the initial amount of water in the tank, which is 120 liters. Celine uses 90 liters of water, so we subtract this amount from the initial quantity:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

This leaves 30 liters of water in the tank. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding this rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives us the total amount of water now in the tank:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of petunias Andy plants. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Given that he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we start by calculating the new total number of cards and the new number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

The new total number of cards is:
- 30 fire type cards
- 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Convert the fraction to a percentage:

   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies each person ate:**
   - Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
   - Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

3. **Convert the number of cookies to calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
   - Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

4. **Calculate the difference in calories consumed:**
   - Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.
   \[
   20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of girls and boys in the school:**
   The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   \[
   \text{Total number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the third class:**
   The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls.
   \[
   \text{Total girls in the first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27
   \]
   Since the total number of girls in the school is 30:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3
   \]

4. **Determine the number of boys in the third class:**
   Each class has 20 students, and the third class has 3 girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of animals killed last night and the number of animals killed today.

**Last Night:**
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

**Today:**
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.
  \[
  \text{Cougars killed today} = 15 - 3 = 12
  \]
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.
  \[
  \text{Wolves killed today} = 3 \times 12 = 36
  \]

**Total Animals Killed Today:**
\[
\text{Total animals killed today} = 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48
\]

**Total Animals Killed Over Both Nights:**
\[
\text{Total animals killed} = (10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars}) + (36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars}) = 25 + 48 = 73
\]

Thus, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, and Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Subtracting this from Mitchel's total:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we calculate how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial number of cows in the stalls. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
- Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the information that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she plans to bake. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which sums up to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens, since the recipe specifies the amount of flour needed per dozen cookies. There are 12 cookies in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \text{ dozens} \]

The recipe states that 2 cups of flour are required for each dozen cookies. Therefore, for 5.5 dozens, the total amount of flour needed is:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the additional fees and then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$350,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the sum of their ages will increase by 20 (10 years for each person).

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (10 years for each person) = 40

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve the problem, let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

   - Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
   - Cost of popsicles = 20 * $0.25 = $5.00

2. Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
   - Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
   - Cost of ice cream bars = 4 * $0.50 = $2.00

3. Add the two amounts to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
   - Total cost = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over two weeks.

In the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, we sum the stories for each person over the two weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add the total number of stories written by all three:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

1 quarter = 25 cents
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of Susan based on her working hours and the break she takes.

1. **Determine the total working hours:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.

2. **Subtract the break time:**
   - She takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

3. **Convert the working time into minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals:**
   - Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.
   - 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.

5. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Each interval earns her $5, so the total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to account for the extra points awarded in the fourth round. Each player who has more than 20 points gets an additional point:

- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

83"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household over a period of time and then determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total rice consumption per meal for the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

   Since they eat rice twice a day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total rice consumption per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The household consumes 14 kg of rice per week.

   Therefore, the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last is:

"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning:

- The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
- Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves.

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

- Total loaves produced: 60
- Loaves sold in the morning: 40
- Loaves remaining: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) loaves.

Then, we determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:

- Half of the remaining loaves: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves.
- These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so each period sells: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) loaves.

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we first need to understand the rate at which each person loses weight.

1. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use her weekly weight loss rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount by which Shannon's iced coffee is weakened, considering both the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than that of a junior programmer.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. 

First, calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required in minutes is:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
- Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

We know the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3C = 60 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows and \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:

   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total number of apples picked over the three days:
\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has based on the information given about Axel's pesos.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos that Axel and Anna have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together:

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had, we start by understanding that he has 12.8 hectares left, which represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land. 

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the situation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the performance is with just the female members, we initially have 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

Thus, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16."

\[ 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \]

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before the jog from the total steps he had taken by the end of the jog:
\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Sally spent and then subtract it from the $10 she initially had.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Cost of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 4 magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost of all items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make to last her 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she will consume. Shannon eats 2 cookies each night, so over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies (12 cookies) at a time, we need to find out how many dozens are required to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% (or 0.01).

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 blouses after applying a 30% discount to each one. 

1. **Determine the discount amount per blouse:**
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30% of $20.
   - Discount amount = \( 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the discounted price per blouse:**
   - Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount.
   - Discounted price = \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:**
   - Total cost = Number of blouses \(\times\) Discounted price per blouse.
   - Total cost = \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D = 180 - C \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationships between the sizes of the lockers:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the final elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet.
2. The comb falls 4,000 feet from this elevation: 
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, the comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver's current elevation is 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[
6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, we start with the total number of cats, which is 50. Four boats each carry away 5 cats, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we find the number of cats remaining on the rock:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats run after a mouse. To find this number, we calculate:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Subtracting the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left, we get the final number of cats remaining on the rock:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cost and Spending Cash:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Kenny has $50 left for spending cash after buying the ticket.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Kenny made from selling his cards is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

2. **Selling Price per Card:**
   - Kenny sells each card for $1.5.

3. **Fraction of Cards Sold:**
   - Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).
   - The total money made from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}C = 150

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To solve this problem, we start with the total number of lollipops Ray had, which is 25. Ray decided to keep 5 lollipops for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops. These 20 lollipops were then equally distributed among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4. Therefore, each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the weight of each piece of cake. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting this from the total weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's drive time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine Wayne's departure time:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

5. **Calculate the difference in their departure times:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of sports cards she has. She has six decks of basketball cards and five boxes of baseball cards.

1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards:
\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards per deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards per box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

3. Add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to get the total number of cards:
\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

5. Each student receives 10 cards, so the number of students is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards per student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost each of them paid for the apples, including the discounts they received.

First, let's calculate Becky's total cost:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Therefore, Becky's total cost after the discount is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate Kelly's total cost:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10% discount.
- The discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- Therefore, Kelly's total cost after the discount is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in the total costs:
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

Thus, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: \(2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}\)
- **Total comforters**: \(1 \text{ comforter/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 80 \text{ comforters}\)
- **Total pillow cases**: \(4 \text{ pillow cases/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 320 \text{ pillow cases}\)
- **Total towels**: \(8 \text{ towels/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 640 \text{ towels}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry:

\[
160 \text{ sheets} + 80 \text{ comforters} + 320 \text{ pillow cases} + 640 \text{ towels} = 1200 \text{ pieces of laundry}
\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many carrot sticks Matt must eat to be allowed to have five cookies. According to the rules set by his dad, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The relationship between the number of cookies and carrot sticks can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to be allowed to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to a common unit. The shark's length is given in feet, and the remoras' lengths are given in inches. 

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each remora is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras:
   - There are 2 remoras, so the combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
   - The shark's length is 10 feet.
   - The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
   - The percentage is calculated as \( \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \).

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up equations for the total cost at each venue and solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate the variable:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of insects found by each person:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we start by adding the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, let's break down the information provided:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs were strawberry.
- 1 pack was grape, costing $2.
- 1 pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood he can purchase.

1. **Cost and Yield:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, we should consider the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 4 piece of wood is \( \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \) dollars per stick.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 8 piece of wood is \( \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \) dollars per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is more cost-effective, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 8 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece costs $6.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks.
   - Therefore, 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood will provide \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, which is July 19th, starting from December 31st.

1. **Calculate the total number of days:**
   - From January 1 to July 19:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - Each pound requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Routine**: Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. **Variations**:
   - For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each week.
   - For 1 week, he spent 6 hours.

First, calculate the number of weeks he followed his regular routine:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks with 5 hours: 2
- Week with 6 hours: 1
- Weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - There are 48 people on the bus.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - New total: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second Stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - New total: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Jame's current age. We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Then, we subtract 5 years to find the cousin's age in 8 years:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

Now, we need to determine the cousin's current age. Since the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Finally, we find the age difference between Jame and his cousin by subtracting Jame's current age from the cousin's current age:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the costs of the items Errol bought. The computer costs $1,100, and the printer costs $400 less than the computer, which means the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ 1100 + 700 = 1800 \]

Errol spent a total of $2,400 on the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer. Therefore, the total cost of the 2 monitors is:
\[ 2400 - 1800 = 600 \]

Since the 2 monitors together cost $600, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ 600 \div 2 = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back based on the information given.

1. Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
2. Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of seashells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

Total vlogs made so far:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Next, we subtract the total vlogs made from her monthly goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To determine how much you end up paying, we need to calculate the total cost including the tip and then split the bill accordingly.

1. Calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. Add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

3. Since the bill is split evenly, each person pays half of the original bill:
   \[
   \text{Your Half of the Bill} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

4. You are responsible for the entire tip, so you pay:
   \[
   \text{Total You Pay} = 25 + 10 = 35
   \]

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

The next day, he adds another $10:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8 from his total:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

Finally, he triples the remaining amount:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Thus, the eldest boy now has:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"To determine the change Verna received, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the number of sandwiches each person ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Adding the number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor gives:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

First, we need to express Shiloh's age in 7 years and his nephew's age in 7 years:
- Shiloh's age in 7 years: \( 44 + 7 = 51 \)
- Nephew's age in 7 years: \( N + 7 \)

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees:
- The actual temperature is 468 degrees.
- The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage error is given by:
  \[
  \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
  \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees:
\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days it takes for a beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The initial height is 4 feet, and it doubles each day. Therefore, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( H(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day:

- Day 0: \( H(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 1: \( H(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 2: \( H(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 3: \( H(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \text{ feet} \)

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much more George needs to pay:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of one gumball.

1. **Convert each type of coin to cents:**
   - Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
   - Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
   - Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
   - Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

2. **Sum the total amount of money:**
   - Total = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

3. **Determine how many gumballs he can buy:**
   - Each gumball costs 5 cents.
   - Number of gumballs = 345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine the total number of legs for the pets in the store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet:

- Each dog has 4 legs. With 5 dogs, the total number of legs for the dogs is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs. With 2 cats, the total number of legs for the cats is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs. With 10 birds, the total number of legs for the birds is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Adding these together, the total number of legs for all the pets is:
\[20 \text{ (dogs)} + 8 \text{ (cats)} + 20 \text{ (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

"To solve the problem, we start with the initial weight Jamaal is using, which is 8 pounds. He then increases this weight by 50%. 

To find 50% of 8 pounds:
\[ 50\% \times 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the original weight:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

However, this new weight is too heavy, so Jamaal decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

- Games purchased in the second year: 24
- Games purchased in the third year: 48
- Games received for Christmas: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

Thus, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which Ruiz and Marissa make chocolates.

1. **Ruiz's Rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's rate is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

2. **Marissa's Rate:**
   - Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa's rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Chocolates Made in 12 Hours:**
   - If they both work for 12 hours, the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz is:
     \[
     60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - The total amount of chocolates made by Marissa is:
     \[
     90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa together is:
     \[
     720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down Howard's spending over the three days:

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends four times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left.

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

**First Four Hours:**
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For four hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Next Two Hours:**
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For two hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Total Earnings:**
- Adding the earnings from both periods:
  \[
  30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Number of rotations per month = \(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation set}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations}\).

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Number of rotations per year = \(145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}\).

3. **Determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - Number of years = \(\frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}\).

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. 

First, we calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items after the discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = \$25 + \$35 = \$60
   \]

2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 30\% \times \$60 = 0.30 \times \$60 = \$18
   \]

3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \$60 - \$18 = \$42
   \]

4. Subtract the total cost after discount from Joe's initial amount of money:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$50 - \$42 = \$8
   \]

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."
"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Butter per dozen croissants**: It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
2. **Butter for 4 dozen croissants**: Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we multiply the butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]
3. **Butter for a week**: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily butter requirement by 7:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 7 days} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow a series of conversions:

1. **Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour:**
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second.
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour).
   - Therefore, the speed in kb per hour is \( 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \).

2. **Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:**
   - There are 1000 kb in 1 Mb.
   - Therefore, the speed in Mb per hour is \( \frac{72000 \, \text{kb/h}}{1000 \, \text{kb/Mb}} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \).

Thus, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Convert the height requirement to inches:**
   The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement in inches is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the additional height Adam needs to grow:**
   Adam's current height is 40 inches. The additional height he needs to reach the requirement is:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years required for Adam to grow the additional height:**
   Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to calculate his commission based on the profit from the car sales. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the total sales amount:**
   James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total acquisition cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition cost per car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total acquisition cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James's commission is 10% of the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17,500}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many men can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, given the total number of riders and the percentages provided.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

2. **Determine the price of the silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price for all three jewels:**
   Now, we sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \[

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. 

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Bob is initially 75 miles ahead. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. 

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by calculating the daily and weekly customer processing rates for each of them.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel expenses**: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- **Monthly maintenance cost** = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- **Monthly maintenance cost** = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- **Annual maintenance cost** = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- **Annual maintenance cost** = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total cost for the first year** = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- **Total cost for the first year** = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
     \[
     30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - First, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
     \[
     30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Then, the cooking time for beans is:
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Sum the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
     \[
     30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of the days over the past 30 days is as follows:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

The next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.

First, convert the current height from feet to inches:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, calculate the additional height needed:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Additional height needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, denoted as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly savings for Neil.
2. Calculate the total savings for Rong over ten years.
3. Calculate the total savings for Neil over ten years.
4. Sum the total savings of both Rong and Neil.

First, let's find out how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculate the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, we first calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) represent the total bill. The heartworm check can be expressed as:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Next, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then compare this total to the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"To determine Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount, we first calculate the total cost of each item he ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the deal and the cost per scoop. The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" and each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 2 paid scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to consider the different rates at which she taps her feet based on whether her arms are raised or at her sides.

1. **Tapping rates:**
   - When her arms are at her sides:
     - Right foot: 300 taps per minute
     - Left foot: 250 taps per minute
   - When her arms are raised:
     - Right foot: 200 taps per minute
     - Left foot: 200 taps per minute

2. **Time distribution:**
   - Total time: 5 minutes
   - Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
   - Time with arms at her sides: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes

3. **Calculate the total taps for each foot:**
   - **Right foot:**
     - With arms at her sides: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
     - With arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
     - Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\)
   - **Left foot:**
     - With arms at her sides: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)
     - With arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
     - Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

4. **Combined total number of taps:**
   - Total right foot taps: 1300
   - Total left foot taps: 1150
   - Combined total: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450 \text{ taps}\)

The combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant after some were sent for repair, we start by calculating the initial total number of chairs. The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. Adding these together gives:

170 + 23 = 193 chairs

Next, we account for the chairs that were sent to the carpenter for repair. There were 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs sent for repair. Adding these together gives:

20 + 13 = 33 chairs

To find the number of chairs remaining in the restaurant, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total number of chairs:

193 - 33 = 160 chairs

Therefore, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is 160."
"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, we first need to calculate the time each takes individually.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Next, we calculate the average time by summing the times and dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship given in the problem: the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given relationship is:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

1. **Total number of spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Percentage of blue spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Convert to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools is 40%.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of people who had voted by midday. Given that 5000 people lined up and 2/5 of them had voted by midday, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means 2000 people had voted by midday, leaving:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

people who had not voted by midday. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. We calculate this as:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted between midday and 16:00. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the ages of the individuals involved. Let's denote Dora's age as \( D \), her father's age as \( F \), and her mother's age as \( M \).

Given:
- Dora's age, \( D = 15 \)
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \)
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \)

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"To determine how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the total annual electricity cost:**
   - The monthly electricity bill is $100.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates:**
   - Jenna has 4 roommates, making a total of 5 people sharing the cost.
   - The annual cost per person is \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) dollars.

Thus, each roommate, including Jenna, will pay \( 240 \) dollars per year for electricity.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses is:
     \[
     8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
     \]
   - Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, the total number of plates is:
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
     \]

2. **Broken Items:**
   - 10 glasses were broken, so the remaining number of glasses is:
     \[
     96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
     \]
   - 6 plates were broken, so the remaining number of plates is:
     \[
     48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
     \]

3. **Total Remaining Items:**
   - The total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the trades Lorraine makes and the resulting number of buttons she ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Number of large stickers left: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
   - She trades these remaining large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \)

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

8. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 87
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \)

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \).

According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, and this total is equal to the number of people on the council, which is 33:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, we can find \( F \) by substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

"To determine how many people think that horse #12 will win, we start by calculating the number of people who think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Next, we find the number of people remaining after those who think horse #2 will win are accounted for:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Then, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, we find the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

40 people - 24 people = 16 people

Thus, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is 16.

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we start by understanding the given information:

- Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
- One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
- There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]
Solving for the total number of Pomeranians:
\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( T \) be the total number of puppies. We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times T = 18
\]
Solving for \( T \):
\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first calculate the total amount of money he currently has. Jayden initially had $70. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Adding this to Jayden's initial amount:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we start by noting that the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas together cost 30 dollars. Therefore, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 - 30 = 34 dollars

Since the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

34 / 2 = 17 dollars

Thus, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the different riding patterns over the week.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let:
- \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob buys.
- \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob buys.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of branches Felix climbs per day based on his weekly earnings. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in a week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbs per day is 60.

"To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower Rose picks.
2. Subtract the petals of the flowers that were dropped.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:**

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
  \[
  4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:**

\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the petals of the flowers that were dropped:**

- 1 flower with 5 petals:
  \[
  5 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 6 petals:
  \[
  6 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 4 petals:
  \[
  4 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 7 petals:
  \[
  7 \text{ petals}
  \]

Total petals dropped:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of petals remaining in the vase:**

\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

\[
\boxed{79}

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the total number of marshmallows used and lost, and then determine how many are left for making additional S'mores.

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag:** 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John:** 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean:** 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground:** 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, subtract this total from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine the total amount of money used by Jack and his three friends, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4 hours they played.

First, let's establish the play time per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- \( u \) be the amount of sugar in ounces.

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance: \( z = f \).
2. The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar: \( s = u \).
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).
4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Substituting the known relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Thus, John spent a total of $4500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - Twice the number of cars he sold is \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars Joe has left is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

So, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy collected, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how it affects the time taken to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production:

- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- The farmer has 3 cows, so the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.

The farmer's goal is to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the goal:

- Additional milk needed: \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

- Additional cows needed: \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each partially used glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800, we first calculate the total cost of these items:

Total cost = Cost of car + Cost of phone
Total cost = $10,000 + $800
Total cost = $10,800

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

Total amount Gabriel has = Money from working on weekends + Money from his brother
Total amount Gabriel has = $5,000 + $200
Total amount Gabriel has = $5,200

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the total cost:

Money needed = Total cost - Total amount Gabriel has
Money needed = $10,800 - $5,200
Money needed = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town will build three times as many homes as in the first year. This means they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add up the homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years is 144.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables based on the given information:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
- My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

Thus, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of books each person has:
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we have \( A \).
- Substitute \( A \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
  \[
  S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
  \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84

   \]
3. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50.
4. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]
5. To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for both the small and large masks separately and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's determine the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to account for all his daily activities and subtract the total from 24 hours, the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Adding these up:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting this from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To solve the problem, we start with the total number of marbles Dean has, which is 30. 

First, Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Calculating 1/5 of 30:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]
So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. We subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
4. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago.

We can write the equation based on the fourth point:
\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10,000 gallons, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the hay requirements for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over the 2-week period. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we determine the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Therefore, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokémon."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching the show.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching the show:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) miles.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \times 18 = 36 \) miles.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) miles.

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 + 110 = 410 \) miles.
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \) miles.

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 - 36 = 374 \] miles.

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \] miles.

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
48"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
   - 25% of 8 years is \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \) years.
   - Therefore, Nani's sister's age is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum the ages of all three family members:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30 years.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had, which is 12 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges.

First, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling:
  \[
  2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
  \]

Next, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
\]

Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
\]

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:
\[
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
\]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[
6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve the problem of how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. The number of additional plants needed is:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90}{30} = 3
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net temperature change over the given time periods.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on low: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we sum the total cooling and subtract the total warming to find the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.
- Net temperature change: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Similarly:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month. Therefore:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of checks Buford writes per year:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the howls of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias' and Chikote's howls.
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - The total combined howl duration is the sum of the howl durations of all three wolves.
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by using the given information:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

The total amount collected from these sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times this total amount. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person at the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices, in terms of \( x \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into \( 8x \) parts.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 8 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After the First 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   Janet works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices and quantities are as follows:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
\[ S = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption:

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total earnings from selling cookies:
   - Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each.
   - Total earnings from cookies = 80 * $1 = $80

2. Calculate the total earnings from selling cupcakes:
   - Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each.
   - Total earnings from cupcakes = 60 * $4 = $240

3. Calculate the total earnings from both cookies and cupcakes:
   - Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320

4. Calculate the amount given to her sisters:
   - Suzanne gave $10 to each of her two sisters.
   - Total amount given to sisters = 2 * $10 = $20

5. Calculate the money left after giving her sisters their share:

"To solve this problem, we start by noting the total number of eggs hidden, which is 100. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone. Therefore, the number of eggs that were found by the friends is the total number of eggs minus the eggs found by the Smith twins and the eggs that were not found:
\[ 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the friends found 30 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day, and then scale that up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In 30 days, 40 dwarves can mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, given that the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches.

First, let's establish the cost per sandwich from the given packages:
- The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- The second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent across the first two packages, we can use this rate to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate her total expenses.
4. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the hourly rate after expenses.

**Step 1: Total hours spent**
Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

**Step 2: Total earnings**
Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

**Step 3: Total expenses**
Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

\[ 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City, which is 1955 kilometers:
\[ 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cups she drinks in that period. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water each day, so over 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of laundry loads Greg does in a year based on his weekly routine.

1. **Weekly Laundry Loads:**
   - Greg washes sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed each week.
   - The laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.

2. **Calculating Twin Sheets Loads:**
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets per load, the number of loads for twin sheets is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

3. **Calculating King Sheets Loads:**
   - The machine can wash 1 king set per load, so the number of loads for the king sheet is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and king sheets:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

5. **Yearly Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is:
     \[
     3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}
     \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes to complete his part. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer, her part took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To determine Frankie's score, we start with the information that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then use his walking speed to find the total time.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine the savings Jenny made by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
2. Determine the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.
3. Determine the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.
4. Calculate the savings by finding the difference between the two costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas.**
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

**Step 2: Determine the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.**
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

**Step 3: Determine the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.**
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

**Step 4: Calculate the savings.**
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

Given:
1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to break down the sales by type and then calculate the earnings for each type.

1. **Total Bikes Sold**: 300
2. **Trekking Bikes Sold**: Half of the total bikes
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes}
   \]
3. **BMX Bikes Sold**: 15% of the total bikes
   \[
   0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes}
   \]
4. **MTB Bikes Sold**: The remaining bikes
   \[
   300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes}
   \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

2. Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.
3. Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
4. Add the extra learning time to the regular class time.
5. Convert the total minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week.**

John has 6 periods a day plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day. He goes to class for 5 days a week:
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total minutes spent in class each week.**

Each class is 40 minutes long:
\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.**

John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days:
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Add the extra learning time to the regular class time.**

Total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours.**

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:**
   \[
   \text{Total days in June} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the total miles Soledad plans to hike each day:**
   \[
   \text{Miles per hike} = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hikes per day} = 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total miles per day} = 125 \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total miles Soledad will hike in June with her current plan:**
   \[
   \text{Total miles in June} = 250 \times 30 = 7500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine the additional miles needed to reach her goal of 9,300 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Additional miles needed} = 9300 - 7500 = 1800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the additional miles per day Soledad must hike to cover the additional miles:**
   \[
   \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left after Pierre and Paul take their shares.

First, let's calculate Pierre's share:
- Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples.
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, let's calculate Paul's share:
- Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples.
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add the shares of Pierre and Paul to find out how much they have taken in total:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total 12 kg to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production by the first four workers:**
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   For the first two workers:
   \[
   2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   For the next two workers:
   \[
   2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Total production by the first four workers:
   \[
   120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift:
   \[
   400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Total production by all five workers: 380 toys.
   - Total production by the first four workers: 200 toys.
   - Production by the fifth worker:
   \[
   380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis gave to Kris are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

1. **Calculate half the circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of this distance is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

Given that Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)
   - \( S = 9 \)

4. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into groups of 8. The number of groups (and thus the number of boxes) is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking 3 miles, considering her different walking speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This can be calculated as:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given information: Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) is the number of marbles Bob currently has. Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to ensure that the final temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T_2 \).

Donny mixes 4 ounces of water from the first mug (33 degrees) with 1 ounce of water from the second mug. The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (from the first mug)
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (from the second mug)
- \( T_2 \) is the unknown temperature of the second mug

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \)
   - So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation for potatoes: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
   - Calculation for scoops: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Set up the proportion to find the number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - We need to find out how many potatoes (\( x \)) are needed for 18 scoops.
   - Proportion: \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \)
   - Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 2 \times x
     \]
     \[
     54 = 2x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) eggs.

2. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs.

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 + 150 = 240\) eggs.

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens is \(240 \div 12 = 20\) dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

First, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

"To solve the problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables. Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. According to the problem:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial amounts of money Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we start by noting that half of the mural is yellow. Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the remaining half of the mural to be divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. The total amount of paint for these three colors is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:

\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1, given that 1 pod is used per cycle.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to break down the problem into the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches, given that he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how much chalk is used each subsequent day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - The remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk for each subsequent day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many apples Newton brought home, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza that Kate's friends will consume and then determine how many whole pizzas are required.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the changes in the number of bandages over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: \( -38 + 50 = +12 \) bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 10 fewer than the first day, so \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: \( -28 \) bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: half a pack, so \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the total amount John spends on both the scotch and the cognac:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\).
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

4. **Total Number of Trees:**
   - Adding the totals together: \(50 + 90 = 140\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"To determine how much root beer each person can drink at the party, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the remaining amount of root beer step by step.

1. **Initial amount of root beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **After the children drank some:**
   The children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie spilled some:**
   Barbie spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie helped himself:**
   Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **At the party:**
   There are 3 people at the party, and they share the remaining 8 gallons equally. The amount each person gets is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:
\[
\boxed{2.67}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be expressed as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes and then the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Total fish = 66
   - Fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \)

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish:**
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
   - Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Total fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
   - Total fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"To determine the distance the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total distance all four dogs need to walk based on the average distance. Given that the average distance per dog is 3 miles and there are 4 dogs, the total distance is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we sum the distances walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The total weight of the tunas is:
\[ 56 \, \text{kg} + 46 \, \text{kg} + 26 \, \text{kg} = 128 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, the total earnings are:
\[ 128 \, \text{kg} \times 0.50 \, \text{\$/kg} = 64 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then find the difference between the selling price and the buying price.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - The selling price is given as \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.
   - The buying price is $72.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \( \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \( \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \).

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the selling price and the buying price.
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27

Thus, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we start by calculating the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day, and Jordan has 2 children. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Next, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 per day and Jordan's wife changes 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how far off Tim's guess was from the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

"To solve the problem, we need to break it down into two main parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the lengths of the two pieces of the board. Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he increases this by 2.5 times.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we need to find out how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

"To determine the total amount Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price:
  \[
  8 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% off:
  \[
  8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[
8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. Therefore, Jake pays 60% of the original price:
\[
40 \times 0.6 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

"To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we first calculate his total earnings from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since Ryan earns $6 each week, his total earnings are:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought one for himself and 3 friends, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \, \text{ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so:
\[ \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
