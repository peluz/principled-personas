"To figure out the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs, given that the repairs increased the value by 150%.
3. Subtract the total investment from the new value of the house to find the profit.

**Step 1: Total Investment**
- Purchase price: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: New Value of the House**
- The repairs increased the value by 150% of the original value.
- Original value: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

**Step 3: Calculate the Profit**
- New value of the house: $200,000
- Total investment: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home after the initial 3 hours.

Next, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. Here's the breakdown of his return trip:

1. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
2. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

3. For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, then she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.

2. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another hour

So, she has covered 6 miles in 2 hours.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the trail:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since she has already spent 2 hours, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the remaining 9 liters of orange drink are mixed with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
2. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has: \( 20 + 5 = 25 \).
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: \( 25 - 2 = 23 \).

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days of the year.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Adding these amounts together gives the total dog food needed for the first year:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- The football team played 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of games won.
- \( L \) as the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (total games played)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (they won 8 more games than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amounts of potato salad for adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To figure out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90
  \]

So, Sasha's profit is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 16000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = $56,000.

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \).
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30769.23 + 12307.69 \).
   - Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92.

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
   - Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92.

3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Finally, find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to identify which items are food and which are nonfood:
- Food items: milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars)
- Nonfood items: light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), roach traps (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there is a 10% tax on nonfood items, we need to calculate the tax:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Adding the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Sure, let's break it down:

1. John has 10 hectares of land.
2. Each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
3. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
   \[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

4. John can harvest every 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

5. The total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:
- Difference in time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To figure out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total earnings from inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle.

- Bicycles: 5 people, each with 2 tires, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles: 3 people, each with 3 tires, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- Unicycle: 1 person, with 1 tire, so \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total earnings are \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents.

Since 100 cents equal 1 dollar, the total earnings in dollars are \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack.
   - After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   - The seagull ate 7 fries (half of 14).
   - The remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   - The pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
   - The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

4. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   - The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - The remaining fries after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - The remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

5. **Ants carried off one fry:**
   - The remaining fries after the ants is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

6. **Five fries were left:**
   - We know that \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

"To figure out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's look at his schedule:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[ 3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[ 2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add the total hours for the week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.
3. **Number of Increases**: Over 36 months, there are 36 / 2 = 18 two-month periods.
4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per gallon:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost of sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

3. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total revenue is \( 10G \).
   - The total cost is \( 5G \).
   - The profit is given as $25.
   - The profit equation is: \( 10G - 5G = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = 5 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   - \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
     \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. This means the net increase in trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}

Total cakes bought: \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, the total number of cakes I bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens and \( W \) be the number of white chickens.
2. According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To figure out how long Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then determine how long it takes him to walk that distance at his walking speed.

The park is a rectangle with a length of 6 miles and a width of 1.5 miles. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( t \) it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

\[ t = \frac{distance}{speed} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we can set up the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

New total cards: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:** Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
5. **Fries taken by Colby:** Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. We have two aquariums:
   - Aquarium 1 has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium 2 has 32 snails.

2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
   \[
   32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

4. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2f
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   28 = 4f
   \]

6. Solve for \( f \):
   \[
   f = \frac{28}{4} = 7

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we add 10 years to each of their current ages, which means adding 20 years in total to their current sum.

20 + 20 = 40

40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we can determine the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Given:
- Total number of players on the football team: 105
- Number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense.
- Number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

From the problem:
- Number of players on the offense: \( 2D \)
- Number of players on the special teams: \( \frac{D}{2} \)

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan period is 5 months. First, convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.00833
   \]

   Now, calculate the total interest for 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.00833 \times 5

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the remaining land represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls.
2. This means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.
3. The performance is with just the female members, so initially, 26 girls are set to perform.
4. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, only half of the 26 girls can perform:
   - 26 / 2 = 13 girls can perform.
5. The choir's 3 teachers decide to join the performance, adding to the number of performers.

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:
- 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**

"To figure out how many cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

   30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles.

3. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile:
   \[
   \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail of hay per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the hay.

4. Each bail of hay costs $3:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we need to determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay.

5. Michael has six 5 dollar bills:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bill} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Calculate the change:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of change Michael has is:

"To figure out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get his desired 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the conditions given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the two allergens. 

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups, and each group has 200 employees.
- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"To figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oats Consumption per Horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, each horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for All Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
   - Total daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - Over 5 days, the total consumption = 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Number of bags needed = 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, so 2 packs contain:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:

"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the order they are stacked. 

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, calculate the total amount of money Ali has from the $10 and $20 bills:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there's a large jar filled with red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We need to find out how many more green jelly beans there are compared to red jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

"To calculate the grams of protein John gets from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day for a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly protein intake from mushrooms is:
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Where \( J \) is Jerry's current age. Simplifying the equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

So:

\[ J = 10 \]

Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To figure out how many hours I need to work to pay for the dental work, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Since I need 2 implants, the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount I need to pay:**

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are twice and three times the smallest angle, which means they are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, the largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:

"To figure out the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to start by understanding the total number of washes she can get from the bottle. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, let's convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour:
- There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour).
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kb.

Next, let's convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- \(72000 \div 1000 = 72\) Mb per hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, let's break it down:

1. The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the requirement in inches is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many more inches he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the requirement:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much I made from selling the used cars.

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   - I sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **Commission:**
   - My commission is 10% of the profit.
   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, I made $17,500 from selling the used cars.

$17,500"

   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of a Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of a Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the difference in their speeds and the initial distance between them. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. The initial distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To figure out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, let's break it down:

1. **Total Time:** James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours.
2. **Free Hour:** He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. **Cost Breakdown:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs twice the first hour, so \(15 \times 2 = 30\).
   - The third hour costs twice the second hour, so \(30 \times 2 = 60\).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs: \(15 + 30 + 60 = 105\).

"To figure out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish reading the 200-page book, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the book at his planned pace of 10 pages per day.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we subtract the number of days it will take Mike to finish reading from the total number of days available:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To figure out the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to break down the expenses:

1. The initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

The total monthly maintenance cost is:
- Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

The annual maintenance cost is:
- Monthly maintenance cost * 12 = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost gives us the total cost for the first year:
- Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the cost of the two vaccines for John's dog is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, the heartworm check costs:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, let's break down the costs and savings:

1. **Cost of damage to car if pothole is not fixed:**
   - The pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.

2. **Cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - The city will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - Total cost of the asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75.
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195.

3. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Cost of damage if not fixed - Cost of fixing the pothole
   - Savings = $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, let's break it down step by step.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. To find the average time, we add the cat's time and the dog's time and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

"To solve the problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches gives us the total length of Topher's shoe:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To figure out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Convert to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%

"To figure out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water he uses to make the ice cubes and then subtract that from the 32 ounces he started with.

First, let's calculate the water used for each type of ice cube:

- For the giant cubes: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, so the total water used for the giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.
- For the medium cubes: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, so the total water used for the medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.
- For the small cubes: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes, so the total water used for the small cubes is \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[12 + 14 + 4 = 30\] ounces.

Finally, subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:

"To solve this, let's set up the equations based on the information given. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it. We know two things:

1. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against: \( F = 2A \).
2. The total number of votes is 33: \( F + A = 33 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, we can find \( F \) by substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the first equation:

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"To figure out the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
2. The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding these fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

So, after buying the fish:
- Total white fish: \( 4 + x \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + y \)

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Let's solve this equation:
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To ensure the pipes don't freeze, we need to figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the house warm enough. Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the night temperature:**
   - The day temperature is 45 degrees.
   - The night temperature is 33 degrees colder than the day temperature.
   - Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees.

2. **Calculate the temperature increase needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees.
   - Current night temperature is 12 degrees.
   - Temperature needed to prevent freezing is 32 degrees.
   - Temperature increase required = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

3. **Determine the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - Number of logs needed = Temperature increase required / Temperature increase per log
   - Number of logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3
4. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary cost for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Since we need the total amount of money paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary cost by 3:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To figure out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, let's start by calculating the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To figure out how much money Jack and his friends used, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]
   - Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     z = 1
     \]

3. **Calculate the Amount of Oil:**
   - The amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces.
   - Substitute \( z = 1 \):
     \[
     4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ ounces}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.
3. The total time walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.
4. To convert the total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
720"
"Alright, let's break this down step by step:

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.
2. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, bringing the total to:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]
3. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]
4. Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, Julie scored:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points} \]

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"Alright, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each segment of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, Mason travels for 4 hours at a rate of 8 miles per hour. The distance for this part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same rate of 8 miles per hour. The distance for this part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both segments:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To figure out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika has $150 from her part-time job.
- Her mom gives her $80.
- She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

   2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
   \]

2. James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair:
   \[
   \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair}
   \]

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of one basket of green food is $25.
2. The cost of one basket of red food is $18, but you get $2 off for each basket of red food.

First, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, calculate the cost for 3 baskets of red food before the discount:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Now, apply the $2 discount for each basket of red food:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Subtract the total discount from the cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms are in one-half of the 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms, knowing that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be my age.
   - My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
   - My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
   - My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The sum of all our ages is 87.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87
     \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - First, expand and combine like terms:
     \[
     x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
     \]
     \[
     6x + 9 = 87
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 9 from both sides:
     \[
     6x = 78
     \]
   - Divide by 6:
     \[
     x = 13

"To figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, let's start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required for 27 students, with each student getting 2 glue sticks:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this need. We divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 infected people and considering that each infected person infects 6 others every day.

**Day 0:**
- Initial infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. With 40 customers each giving her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. First, calculate 10% of Rafaela's total:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
2. According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

Now, we know Anne has 16 books. To find out how many books Fawn has:
\[ F = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   With 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Determine the number of flowering plants:**

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and assuming the payment is for all the times she mowed his lawn, \( J \) must be 1 (since the problem doesn't specify a rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

Now, we can calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:
- Joe's lawn: \( J = 1 \) time
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J = 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times

Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed lawns, and she mowed lawns 9 times, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales:
- Total earnings = $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns = $6
- Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is:

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, we calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Adding this to the initial 12-hour rate:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"To figure out how much hay Nate needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the hay needed for the goats:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- There are 15 goats.
- So, the total hay for the goats is \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, we calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
- Twice the amount each goat needs is \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
- So, each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
- There are 12 sheep.
- So, the total hay for the sheep is \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:
- Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
- Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Currently, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is: \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds: 200
   - Patients admitted over 2 weeks: 700
   - Total occupied beds: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity of the hospital: 1000 beds
   - Total occupied beds: 900 beds
   - Unoccupied beds: \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total emails sent per day**: 16
2. **Work emails**: 7

First, we calculate the number of non-work emails:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we determine how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder are to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. The remaining emails are:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:
\[ 1 \]

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out Shawna's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, to find out how old Shawna's father is, we know he is five times as old as Shawna:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
2. Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \) (total Pokemon caught)
2. \( X = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, I'll calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

Next, I'll calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance traveled north: \(36 \text{ miles}\).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

  3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, I add the peeling time and the cooking time to get the total time:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take me 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights go to Greece.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the remaining flights are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), and each destination (France and Germany) gets half of this, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To solve this, we first determine the rate at which I read. If it takes me 10 minutes to read 3 pages, then my reading rate is 3 pages per 10 minutes, or 0.3 pages per minute.

To find out how long it takes to read 18 pages, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, I spend 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests check out early, so the number of guests becomes \(100 - 24 = 76\).
3. 15 guests check out late, reducing the number of guests to \(76 - 15 = 61\).
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests check in, increasing the number of guests to \(61 + 30 = 91\).
5. After dinner, 7 more guests check in, bringing the total to \(91 + 7 = 98\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the prices:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of animals sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x = 12x \).
   - The total earnings from all sales is \( 8x + 12x = 20x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know the total earnings are $120, so:
     \[
     20x = 120
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
     \]

5. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since \( x = 6 \), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, if 40 dwarves each mine 36 pounds of ore per day, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:
\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

To find out how much ore they can mine in 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

"To figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Weekly Laundry:**
   - Greg needs to wash sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed each week.
   - The laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, Greg will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so Greg will need to do:

     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheets}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and king sheets:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

5. **Yearly Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is:
     \[
     3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}

"To figure out how long 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Each cat eats 60 grams of food per feeding.
2. Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed per feeding is:
   \[ 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \]

3. The cats are fed twice a day, so the total amount of food consumed per day is:
   \[ 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

4. To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   \[ 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) be the amount of fence Harry gets.

1. \( S + H = 100 \) (total fence)
2. \( H = S + 60 \) (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

Substitute the second equation into the first:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required, and finally, calculate the total cost.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area of all four walls = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

2. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**

"To find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate at which it blinks. Given that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate of blinking per minute:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for 459 blinks. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The probability of the first lottery ticket winning is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.
3. To find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.
4. Converting this to a percentage, we get 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Since Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, Carlos must have collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey must have collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:

\[
27 \text{ (Jim)} + 22 \text{ (Carlos)} + 11 \text{ (Carrey)} = 60 \text{ seashells}
\]

They then divided the 60 seashells equally among themselves:

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5

"Alright, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12

   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how many books Bob can buy per school, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine the cost of one book. Since 100 books cost $500, the cost per book is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Finally, since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
   \[
   \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
   \]

So, Bob can buy \(\boxed{1800}\) books per school."

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production.
   - Time required = Total snowballs needed / Net snowballs made per hour
   - Time required = 60 / 12 = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

First, we need to find out how much each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we determine the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how much I will earn after selling all the tunas, I need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas.
2. Multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram.

First, let's add up the weights of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Next, I'll calculate the total earnings:
- The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, I will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

If Ian has a board that is 40 feet long and he cuts it into two pieces where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece. Then, the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we start by calculating the sale price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it is $3.00 off, so the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we divide the sale price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick. There are 30 sticks in the bag, so:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"Alright, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of strawberry cubes.
- Let \( B \) be the number of blueberry cubes.

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is:

"To solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time it takes for each side:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the land part and the water part.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 100 yards (half of 200 yards)
3. **Distance in Water**: 100 yards (half of 200 yards)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we start by determining Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, Emma must be:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Next, we calculate the average of their ages by adding their ages together and dividing by 2:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price.
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon.
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora, so he is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Age of John's Youngest Son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Age of John's Youngest Son in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the peeling rate for Ana:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Determine the peeling rate for Jane:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference between the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To figure out how much Mark paid in total, let's break it down step by step.

First, the cost of the new radiator is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the price Mark pays for the radiator is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours to install the radiator:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this, we first need to find out the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends):

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
