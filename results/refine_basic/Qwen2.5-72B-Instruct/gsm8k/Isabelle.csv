"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total investment.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. So, the total investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down:

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find out how many meters he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters each week.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement:**
   - Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Total daily feed requirement = 3 cups/chicken/day * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

2. **Calculate the total feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
   - Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

3. **Determine the feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total daily feed requirement = 60 cups.
   - Total feed given so far = 40 cups.
   - Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- For 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.
- In each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"Hello! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

We know that:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Let's calculate the number of sheep in each city step by step.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of sheep in all three cities:
- Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
- Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the full 200 GB file again:**
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file: 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows restart: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the full file again: 100 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \)

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:
\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to consider both the costs and the revenue generated each year.

1. **Initial Planting Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3
4. **Net Annual Profit**: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To determine the number of years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, then she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.

2. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**
   - Total Distance = 12 miles
   - Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

2. **Total Time Required:**
   - Using the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for Total Time:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Time Already Spent:**
   - Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

4. **Remaining Time:**
   - Remaining time to complete the trail = Total Time - Time Already Spent
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

5. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total Distance - Distance Already Covered
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

6. **Required Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - Using the formula for speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the remaining 9 liters of orange drink are mixed with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, let's break down each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is:

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then extend that to a week.

1. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
2. John has 10 dogs.

First, we calculate the total time spent per day:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent per week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, let's start by figuring out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   - Over 30 days, he eats: \( 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \).

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is: \( \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is: \( 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \).

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \(6\) miles per hour × \(2\) hours = \(12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5\) miles per hour × \(4\) hours = \(6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12\) miles + \(6\) miles = \(18\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total calories in the bag:**
   - The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories:**
   - The entire 300g bag has 1250 calories.
   - Grams per calorie = 300 grams / 1250 calories = 0.24 grams/calorie.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories * 0.24 grams/calorie = 48 grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, one for each cup of coffee.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

We can set up the equation to find \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To help Uriah lighten his book bag, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total weight of the 30 comic books he plans to remove. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

After removing the comic books, Uriah still needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To solve this, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( W \) be the number of games won and \( L \) be the number of games lost. We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can express the number of copies Marilyn's record sold as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the dinosaur picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amounts of potato salad for adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old.
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey.

First, we can determine Corey's age:
- Since James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we can find Amy's age:
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Finally, we can determine Jackson's age:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your gardening math problem. Let's figure out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and he also has one before bed. This routine is followed every weekday. On weekends, however, he switches things up a bit and has a soda with dinner instead of water.

Let's break it down:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks 4 glasses of water each day. So, for 5 days, that's 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses.
- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 3 glasses of water each day. So, for 2 days, that's 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses.

Adding these together, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 + 6 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across. We know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to cover 14 segments, knowing that each segment takes 10 minutes:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, I'll calculate how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy's mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then calculate the volume. 

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV time he spent from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we need to determine how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( d \) represent the number of ducks. We can set up the equation:
\[ 300 = 50d \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is:

"To figure out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water and the total amount used.

1. **Identify the ratio and total amount:**
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the common factor for the ratio.
   - The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons.
   - The amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups.
   - The total amount is the sum of the sugar and water: \( 7x + 13x = 20x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that \( 20x = 120 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 20, we get \( x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

4. **Calculate the amount of sugar:**
   - The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \).
   - Substituting \( x = 6 \), we get \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

First, let's find Lylah's salary:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we apply the 40% increase to Lylah's salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her running speeds at different times. 

For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in the first 3 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, her speed drops to 5 miles per hour. She continues to run for the remaining 4 hours at this speed. The distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these two distances together gives us the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.
- The test had 75 questions in total.
- So, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.
- The test had 100 questions in total.
- So, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Total incomplete questions = \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the number of pink gumballs
- \( B \) is the number of blue gumballs, which is 12

Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, calculate \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. Over a week (7 days), this amounts to:
   \[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

2. Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked these 14 hours, his earnings would be:
   \[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"Sure, let's break down the costs and calculate the total, including the tax on nonfood items.

First, we identify the food and nonfood items:
- Food items: milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars)
- Nonfood items: light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), roach traps (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the nonfood items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Adding the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:**
   - John has 10 hectares of land.
   - Each hectare has 100 pineapples.
   - So, the total number of pineapples is \( 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \).

2. **Determine how many times John can harvest his field in a year:**
   - John can harvest every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the number of harvests per year is \( \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Each harvest yields 1000 pineapples.
   - There are 4 harvests in a year.
   - So, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is \( 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \).

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To figure out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles that came by.

First, let's calculate the number of tires for each type of vehicle:
- Bicycles: 5 people each with 2 tires, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles: 3 people each with 3 tires, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- Unicycle: 1 person with 1 tire, so \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's solve the problem step by step, starting with the information given:

1. Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate 14 of them.
2. A seagull then stole the pack and ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one more fry.
6. Finally, 5 fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. After Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. The three pigeons ate 9 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, we add the hours from all the days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.
3. **Number of Increases**: Over 36 months, there are 36 / 2 = 18 two-month periods.
4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

   \]
5. Substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
   \[
   2B + B = 24
   \]
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
   \[
   B = 8

"To find the total cost of each uniform, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

"To figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. **Calculate the total annual payment:**
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"Sure, let's calculate the total time Billy will need to prep the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

First, we need to determine the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we divide the number of apples her mom picked by 2:
\[ \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the apples Jenna picked to the apples her mom picked:
\[ \text{Total apples} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, they both picked 30 apples in total.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Let's break it down:

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - Total straw distributed: 160 pieces.

4. **Straw for rats:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats: \(3 \times r \times 6 = 18r\) pieces.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Hello! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question about Elaine's Pokemon cards.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

"To find out how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **One-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Original weekly salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.

3. **Original annual salary:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **New weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New annual salary with the raise:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money made in the year:**
   - Total money = One-time monetary reward + New annual salary
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

$114,200"
"Hello! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question about Josie's grape farm and wine production.

Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find out the total amount of grapes produced, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons of grapes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels of wine} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cheese for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total.

First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode during the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode during the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total:
- Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40 grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20 grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To find the cost of each cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   Each plate costs $6000.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   \[
   \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   \[
   20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[

"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this chicken egg problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( W \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \(d\) and \(v\):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can set up the equation to find the number of customers on the third day:
   \[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ 250 + x = 500 \]
   \[ x = 500 - 250 \]
   \[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.

The principal amount is $2000, and the interest is 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over this period is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question about James's Pokemon cards.

James starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

First, let's calculate the total number of cards he has initially:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so he now has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

- James buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:

"To figure out how many tomato vines Steve needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
2. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes per week.
5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so to produce 63 tomatoes, Steve needs \(63 \div 3 = 21\) vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of students in the school hall is 1000.
2. 30% of the students leave through exit A:
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students
3. After 300 students leave through exit A, the remaining number of students is:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students
4. 3/5 of the remaining students leave through exit B:
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students
5. The rest of the students leave through exit C. To find this number, we subtract the students who left through exits A and B from the total:
   - 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, the total number of letters he receives each week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of pages he needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time he spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

Thus, Mike spends \(\boxed{3}\) hours writing letters each week."

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's solve this step by step. We have two aquariums: one with 4 snails and another with 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time is:

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
2. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

"To find out how much John pays a year for his driving service, we need to break down the costs into two main parts: the cost per mile and the monthly bonus.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so the weekly miles driven are 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so the annual miles driven are 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so the total annual bonus is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Books and Unsold Books:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 200.
   - The number of books sold in the first and current years is 90 + 45 = 135.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:

"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he received due to the company's good performance.

1. **Calculate the total number of working hours in April:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - April has 30 days, which is approximately 4.29 weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 = 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.
   - Total working hours in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson earns $10 per hour.
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"To figure out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in one week:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Joey loses \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \).

Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:
- Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks.
- To lose 8 pounds, Sandy will need \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \).

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Hello! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa. Let's break down his expenses:

1. **Business Suits**: 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   \[
   5 \times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200
   \]

Now, let's add up all these expenses:
\[
600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
\]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he plans to spend is:
\[
6000 - 2000 = 4000
\]

Subtracting the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cera's Current Age:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 10 people left (since 1/4 of 40 is 10). If 22 men stayed at the party, we need to determine how many women are left.

First, let's find out how many men left:
- Initially, there were 25 men.
- 22 men stayed, so 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must have been women.

Now, let's calculate the number of women who stayed:
- Initially, there were 15 women.
- 7 women left, so 15 - 7 = 8 women stayed.

Therefore, the number of women left is 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

"To solve this, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Calculate the new total distance Tyson runs each day.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

The market price of the wallpaper is $400. A DIY project saves 20% of this cost. 

First, calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself. 

Next, subtract the savings from the market price to find the total cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale, let's break down the sales for each day and account for the returns:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\(50 \times 2 = 100\) shoes.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan is for 5 months. First, convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
   \]

   Now, calculate the total interest for 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} \approx 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, this means that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Then:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, I'll first calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

2. Add up all the stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

3. Count the total number of zebras:
   \[
   2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]

4. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Cannolis and Corns:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so:
     \[
     \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80
     \]

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
     \[
     \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
     \]

3. **After Buying Fewer Corns:**
   - Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
     \[
     \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is:
     \[
     \text{Combined total} = 100 + 60 = 160
     \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he found out he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can add up the steps he has already taken and subtract this from his total goal to see how many steps he had left before his jog. Then, we can determine how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the steps he had left after the jog from the steps he had left before the jog.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left to reach 10,000 before the jog:
10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps

Steps left after the jog:
2,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog:
4,000 (steps left before the jog) - 2,000 (steps left after the jog) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks for the fourth of July. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400.
2. He also buys another pack that costs twice as much, so that's \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of these two packages before any discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. The discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After applying the discount, the cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total, the final amount Tim spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars on fireworks.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation: 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To figure out how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Charlotte wants to buy before any discounts:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $165.00:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Wayne's Drive Time:**
   - Wayne's drive from his hotel to the theater takes 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive is four times as long as Wayne's.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - This means Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive takes 4 minutes).

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck contains 25 cards:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we calculate the number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes, and each box contains 40 cards:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives:
\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

"Sure, let's calculate the costs for Becky and Kelly step by step.

First, for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- Total cost before discount: \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Total cost after discount: \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- Total cost before discount: \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount.
- Discount amount: \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- Total cost after discount: \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Difference in cost: \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar.

So, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"To solve this, let's break down the laundry items per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: 2 sheets/room * 80 rooms = 160 sheets
- **Total comforters**: 1 comforter/room * 80 rooms = 80 comforters
- **Total pillow cases**: 4 pillow cases/room * 80 rooms = 320 pillow cases
- **Total towels**: 8 towels/room * 80 rooms = 640 towels

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry:

160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = 1200 pieces of laundry

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake to use up all her sprinkles.

Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs to bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the information given. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \). According to the problem, one-fourth of the total number of students is 20:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To figure out how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his new shoes, we need to break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total minutes required to break in the shoes by the number of days he can walk.

First, let's determine the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks. Since he can walk 4 days a week, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of walking days per week:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day. The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. We divide this total by the number of days he can walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the overlaps between the allergies. 

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Total: 9 + 6 = 15

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they have been counted twice. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
- Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total kids in the class: 32
- Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question about Uncle Ben's horses.

To figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oats Consumption for One Horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, each horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for Four Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has four horses.
   - So, the total daily consumption for all four horses is 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - Over five days, the total consumption is 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the amount in each bag: 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's denote:
- The number of insects David found as \( D \).
- The number of insects Lily found as \( L \).
- The number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used together, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, let's convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4 to make it easier to add:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which cost $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To find out the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost and Yield of Each Type of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend on wood.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that provides the most sticks per dollar. However, since the question asks for the most sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we will focus on the 2 x 4 pieces.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To figure out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 sled dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Next, we need to determine the number of pairs of snowshoes:
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs needed = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To figure out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of bus trips without the pass:**
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
   - She does this 5 days a week.
   - So, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - Therefore, the total cost of bus trips per week is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:**
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings by buying the weekly bus pass is the difference between the total cost of bus trips without the pass and the cost of the weekly bus pass.
   - Savings = Total cost without the pass - Cost of the pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for. 

First, let's determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit:
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days

- Total cost of computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Next, we subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
- Total cost of 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Finally, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know that the boys brought back 60 shells each.
2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of shells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of shells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's break it down step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To figure out how much I need to pay, I'll start by calculating the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:

$50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Since my wife and I are splitting the bill evenly, but I'm paying the entire tip, I need to pay:

$50 / 2 (my half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $25 + $10 = $35

Therefore, I end up paying $35.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the problem:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
3. Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).
4. In the second half, Elvis saves twice as much each day, so he saves \( 2x \) per day.
5. The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
6. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]
7. We know the total savings for the month is $1125, so:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
9. The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars, with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

   - Second flower shop: 15 roses
   - Third flower shop: 30 roses

   Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

2. **Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per month:**
   - Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

3. **Calculate the total number of roses Ford can supply per month:**
   - Ford grows 40 roses every week.
   - Total roses Ford can supply per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

4. **Determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:**
   - Roses required per month = 260 roses
   - Roses Ford can supply per month = 160 roses
   - Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

"To figure out the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to understand the percentage by which her oven is off. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

First, let's calculate the percentage increase:
- The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage increase is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set for a desired actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the tires rotate \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, the total number of rotations per month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of rotations per year is \( 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \) rotations.

4. **Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.
   - The number of years before replacement is \( \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \) years.

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we first need to determine the total number of washes she can get from the bottle. The bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, so with 1 pump per wash, she will get:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The bottle costs $24.00, so the cost per pump is:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with Joe's shopping trip.

Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip. The store is offering a 30% discount on all items. The shirt he wants costs $25, and the shorts cost $35. Let's figure out how much he will have left after his purchase.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50, so after spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after his purchase.

"To figure out how much butter Juan will need, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how much butter is required for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants will require \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\) pound of butter.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - Since 1 pound of butter is needed per day, for 7 days, the total amount of butter required is \(1 \times 7 = 7\) pounds.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Cost per month: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Cost per month for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional 45 months cost
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, let's break it down:

- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is 16 ounces (since 1 pound = 16 ounces).
- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Scarlett spent on her aquarium and all the other items.

Let's break it down:

- The aquarium cost her $10.00.
- She bought 2 bags of rocks, each costing $2.50, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
- She also got 3 pieces of coral, each for $2.00, so that's 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- She bought 20 fish, each for $0.50, so that's 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
- Lastly, she needed fish food, which cost $2.00.

Now, let's add it all up:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet, and since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the requirement in inches is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many more inches he needs to grow to meet the height requirement, we subtract his current height from the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To determine how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the difference in their speeds and the distance between them. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. 

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Julie's weekly production is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Adding both their weekly productions together gives us the total weekly production:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. 

The volume of the hole is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time it will take him to dig the hole is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly hanger rental is $5,000.
3. The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A, each costing $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
  7 * $0.5 = $3.5
- He also bought 10 candies of type B, each costing $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
  10 * $0.75 = $7.5

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of all the candies:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
$15 - $11 = $4

So, Adam received $4 in change.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's figure out how many books Sally has.

We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and Janey has 21 books. We can set up the equation like this:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

First, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches:**
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - Current height = 20 feet
   - Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

2. **Determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches:**
   - Desired height = 600 inches
   - Current height = 240 inches
   - Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

3. **Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:**
   - Growth rate = 30 inches per day
   - Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

So, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how many toys James needs for the doggie shelter.

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs join the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs. After buying these toys, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. This means he needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs. When he returns, he discovers that 3 dogs have left the shelter, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs. Since he already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is:

4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 1 (final purchase) = 25

"To find out how much Skyler invested, let's break down the investments step by step.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount.
   - Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances's investment
   - Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

"To find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal, we first add up the signatures they already have:

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:
\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that amount. So, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

If Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load the elevator can handle.

1. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
2. Jack and 8 other adults make a total of 9 people.
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Therefore, Max has \( 68 + 5 = 73 \) cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \( 73 - 12 = 61 \) cookies.

3. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**

"To find the original length of the dress, let's start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( L \) represent the original length of the dress in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]
\[ 1.5L = 140 - 20 \]
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's solve this step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and the combined ages of all five children total 44 years.

Let's denote:
- The age of one twin as \( T \)
- The age of one triplet as \( R \)

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \)
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this, let's start by calculating the cost of the candies. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rong's Monthly Savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Neil's Monthly Savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong.
   - First, calculate 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

3. **Total Savings Over Ten Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.
   - Rong's total savings over ten years: \( 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \).
   - Neil's total savings over ten years: \( 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \).

4. **Combined Total Savings:**
   - Add Rong's and Neil's total savings: \( 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \).

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The heartworm check cost is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - Amount left: \( 125 - 100 = 25 \) dollars.

So, John leaves with 25 dollars."
"To find the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the fireworks from two sources: the city's display and the ones she sets off herself.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:
- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks in the city's display is \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks.

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her house:
- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- So, the number of fireworks she can see from the city's display is \( 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \) fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah has 3 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks she will set off is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the fireworks she sets off herself to find the total number of fireworks she will see:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135 fireworks.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, including Larry:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives us the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out the speed of the turtle. If the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and runs at 15 feet per second, then the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total water usage by the city:**
   - The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Calculate the industrial water usage:**
   - 80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the industrial water usage is \( 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \) of the river's total water.

3. **Calculate the non-industrial water usage:**
   - The non-industrial water usage is the remaining portion of the city's total water usage.
   - This is \( 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \) of the river's total water.

Thus, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream would be made in 48 hours, let's break down the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - The factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:

- **Chocolate Ice Cream in 48 hours:**
  - \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

- **Vanilla Ice Cream in 48 hours:**
  - \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of both types of ice cream to get the overall production:

- **Total Quarts:**

"Sure, let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Sure, let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with her $6.00, considering the deal at the ice cream parlor.

Each scoop costs $1.50, and the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. 

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

   - Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

3. **Total Days:**
   - Two weeks equal 14 days.

4. **Total Candy Consumed:**
   - Ginger: \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy: \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \)

5. **Candy Left After Two Weeks:**
   - Ginger: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \)

6. **Difference in Candy:**
   - Amy has \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \) more candy than Ginger.

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"Sure, let's calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.

"To solve the problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches gives us the total length of Topher's shoe:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. We can set up the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

   - Candidate A got 20% of the total votes.
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Next, determine the number of votes candidate B received:
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Finally, calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

"Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, which means Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris's new total is:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

and Beck's new total is:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract Beck's total from Boris's total:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three homes is 250.
- The first house needs half as many cases as the second house.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as \( x \).

Since the first house needs half as many cases as the second house, the second house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases as well.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of cases:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Hello! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. To find out how much money he makes from the eggplants, we multiply the number of eggplants by the price per eggplant:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make, we subtract the amount he has already made from his goal:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling his 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the journey into the driving and hiking portions and calculate each distance separately.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

2. **Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

3. **Calculate Emma's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30T \)
   - Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

4. **Calculate Ava's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
   - Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

5. **Find the Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

"To solve this, let's break it down:

- For 5 days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times each day.
- For the remaining 2 days, they ride their bikes twice as much as on the usual days, which means 6 times each day.

First, calculate the total number of rides for the 5 usual days:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rides for the 2 special days:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, add the rides from the usual days and the special days:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
3. After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3
4. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:

"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school, we need to consider the contributions from both the students and the teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of students:
- There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 40 \times 25 = 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Now, let's calculate the number of teachers:
- There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Finally, let's find the total number of trees planted by adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 + 240 = 1240

The total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:

"To figure out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, let's start by adding up the stuffed animals she already has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. So, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To earn the video game achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Let's break down how much she has already played:

- For the first 2 weeks, she plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.
- For the next week, she plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Adding these together, the total hours she has played so far is \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

To find out how many more hours she needs to play to reach 30 hours, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **First Car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second Car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

1. **Third Grade:**
   - Number of students: 500
   - Number of students who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - Number of students: 100
   - Number of students who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - Number of students: 400
   - Pass rate: Twice the fourth grade's pass rate
   - Fourth grade pass rate: 40/100 = 0.40
   - Fifth grade pass rate: 2 * 0.40 = 0.80
   - Number of students who passed: 0.80 * 400 = 320

4. **Total Number of Students:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

5. **Total Number of Students Who Passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700

6. **Overall Pass Rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%

"To figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Glass Chips**: Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips. So, the total number of glass chips is:
   \[
   2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Chips per Square Inch**: It takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. Therefore, the total area of the mosaic that can be made with 144 chips is:
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the Mosaic**: Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:**
   Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts of tea.
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:**
   Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea.
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. **Add the tea consumed by both groups of students:**
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. **Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:**
   There are 10 quarts of tea left.
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. **Convert quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):**
   \[
   48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To figure out how many branches Felix climbed on average each day, we need to start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he charges $0.25 for each branch and he made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
3. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
4. They drop 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 \text{ (John's S'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's S'mores)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining 14 marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To figure out how much money Jack and his friends used, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce salt scrub.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. We subtract the number of cars sold and given away from the total number of cars Joe initially had:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know the total number of Magic Cards is 341. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to consider the base installation fee and any additional charges for items beyond what is included in the standard package.

The standard package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's determine the number of additional items:
- Additional mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Additional chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Additional pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

Total additional items: \(2 + 1 + 10 = 13\)

Each additional item costs $15.00, so the cost for the additional items is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

The base installation fee is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 129 + 195 = 324 \]

So, the total cost for Angela will be:

"To find out how much money Roy has, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, Anthony's savings are:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
   \[
   0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Adding this to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
   \[
   30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars}

"Hello there! Let's work through this problem step by step, just like we would in a fun math class!

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - So, \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason is traveling at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours initially, and then after a rest, he continues for another 6 hours. To find the total distance he has traveled, we calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together.

For the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To figure out how much money I have in my purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in my old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
- I have been paid $150 for my part-time job.
- My mom gives me $80.
- I still need $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money I have in my purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money I have is the sum of my purse money, my part-time job earnings, and the money from my mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, I have $120 in my purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, let's start by calculating the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

First, we calculate the slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down:

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows required is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Now, we add the remaining lengths together:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how much more money Gabriel needs to buy his car and phone.

First, let's add up the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- The car costs $10,000.
- The phone costs $800.
- So, the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Next, let's see how much money Gabriel already has:
- He has $5,000 from working on weekends.
- His brother gave him $200.
- So, the total amount he has is $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
- $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest investment, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \).
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 300 \left(1 + 0.75 \times 3\right) \]
\[ A = 300 \left(1 + 2.25\right) \]
\[ A = 300 \times 3.25 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:**
   - There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
   - Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

2. **Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos used:**
   - Total burritos used = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos

4. **Subtract the total number of burritos used from the original number of burritos ordered:**
   - Original number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos
   - Total number of leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 23
\]

So, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"Let's solve this step by step. We know that:

1. Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the information given:
- \( S = A + 25 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

We also know that the total number of books is 85:
- \( S + A + F = 85 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
- \( S = (F - 12) + 25 \)
- \( S = F + 13 \)

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:
- \( (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \)
- \( F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \)
- \( 3F + 1 = 85 \)
- \( 3F = 84 \)
- \( F = 28 \)

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle for each type of drink:

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the specific quantities David wants to buy:

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total:

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**

"To solve the problem, let's start by figuring out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to determine in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of Kelly's grocery items:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Since she has 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and assuming the payment is for all the times she mowed his lawn, \( J \) must be 1 (since the problem doesn't specify a rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

Now, let's calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:
- Joe's lawn: \( J = 1 \) time
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J = 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times

Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed lawns, and she mowed lawns 9 times, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales:
- Total earnings = $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns = $6
- Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74

So, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, which means she read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today. Daniel didn't read any pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages. The total number of pages Daniel read is \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. This means they will use 2 adult bowls in total.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls.
4. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After Calvin and his wife have their dinner, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls
5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's figure out how much William spent in total.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50.
2. William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]
3. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50.
4. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]
5. To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, let's break it down step by step.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- This means each small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the total material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- This means each large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the total material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find the average price per ticket that Deepa paid, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought. 

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 tickets

Next, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total number of tickets = 27

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 = $8

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you figure out how much free time Harold has in his day.

First, let's break down Harold's daily activities:
- Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
- He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
- He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour:**
   - Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - This means he completes \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) packages per hour.

2. **Determine his hourly earnings:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
   - Therefore, his hourly earnings are \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \) dollars per hour.

3. **Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:**
   - He works 8 hours a day.
   - His total earnings are \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which means every 30 minutes.
2. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.
3. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one, so it takes \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.
4. To find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30 (since he drinks one bottle every 30 minutes).

So, \(180 \div 30 = 6\).

John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:

"To solve this, let's break down the expenses Julia and Nadine made:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Total Revenue:**
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   \[

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, let's add this to the initial 12-hour rate:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours, we subtract the total cost of his stay from the 24-hour rate:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hay for the goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. **Hay for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. **Total hay needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Craig and his brother are playing a game where they take turns spelling out the longest words they know and counting the letters in those words. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. 

First, we calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled:
\[ 20 \text{ words} \times 15 \text{ letters/word} = 300 \text{ letters} \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we calculate the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the letters spelled by Craig and his brother:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} \]

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Swim Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swim:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**

"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

We know the following:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so we need to subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Currently, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - So, the number of initially occupied beds is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
     \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
     \[
     50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients}
     \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we calculate his age as:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.
2. Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( X \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
  \[
  A + S + X = 339
  \]
- Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
  \[
  X = S + 5
  \]
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
  \[
  S = 4A - 13
  \]

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40

   - Distance traveled north: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

Next, I'll calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance traveled north: \(36 \text{ miles}\).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
374 miles"
"Sure, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had and how many were left after the party.

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
2. She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Adding these together, the total number of brownies Greta had initially is:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[ 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \]

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of:
   \[
   2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
   \]
3. After giving away 4 boxes, she has:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]
4. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
   \]
5. The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 2:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
   \]
6. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"To find the total number of states in both India and the USA, we start by noting that the USA has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

First, we calculate half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"To figure out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, let's break down the sales and calculate the earnings step by step.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**

"Sure, let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the remaining soil.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To figure out how long it will take me to peel and cook 90 shrimp, I need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:
- I can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, I divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp:
- I can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, I need to determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
  \[
  \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
  \[
  \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, I add the peeling time and the cooking time to get the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take me 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information:

- Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill.
- He also writes 1 check per month for the gas bill.
- He writes 2 checks per month to the church.
- He writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service.

First, calculate the monthly checks:
- Electric bill: 1 check/month
- Gas bill: 1 check/month
- Church: 2 checks/month

Total monthly checks:
1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks/month

Next, calculate the annual checks for the monthly bills:
4 checks/month × 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Now, add the quarterly checks:
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter × 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Finally, add the annual checks for the monthly and quarterly bills:
48 checks/year (monthly) + 4 checks/year (quarterly) = 52 checks/year

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights go to Greece.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the remaining flights are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), and each destination (France and Germany) gets half of this, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church is:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)
- For the kids: \( 4 \times x = 4x \)

Adding these together gives the total size of the watermelon:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 8 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After the First 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, if 40 dwarves each mine 36 pounds of ore per day, the total amount of ore mined by all dwarves in one day is:
\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

To find out how much ore they can mine in 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich based on the given packages and then apply that rate to the 8-sandwich package.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the packages we know:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the 8-sandwich package:
\[ 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:

"To figure out the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

"To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To figure out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for my 3 cats, I need to break it down step by step:

1. Each cat eats 60 grams of food per feeding.
2. Since I have 3 cats, they eat a total of 60 grams * 3 = 180 grams per feeding.
3. The cats are fed twice a day, so they consume 180 grams * 2 = 360 grams of food per day.
4. With 720 grams of cat food, it will last 720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves each week by the number of weeks she has been saving:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks she needs to save 80 more toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - So, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

2. Next, we know that one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second. Therefore, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Since there are 5 springs, each working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by all 5 springs in 4 hours is:
   - 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Determine the initial height:**
   - Each story in the mall is 24 feet high.
   - Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, so the initial height is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - After the first bounce, the height is \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce.
   - After the second bounce, the height is \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to calculate the total number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let the total weight of the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required, and finally, calculate the total cost.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area of all four walls = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

2. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. So, in 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. So, in 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down each one.

1. **Biggest Slide:**
   - Length: 300 feet
   - Speed: 60 feet/minute
   - Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

2. **Second Biggest Slide:**
   - Length: 240 feet
   - Speed: 80 feet/minute
   - Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

3. **Difference in Time:**

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day at the office. Let's calculate the total time he spends on these activities over 5 days.

First, let's find out how much time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour on lunch and breaks each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time over 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate the distance Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this amount from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. Sheila then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off its original price of $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

1. The number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
2. The number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the large jellyfish, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, so:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. She walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
3. It takes her 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach.

First, let's find her speed on the beach:
- If 2 miles take 40 minutes, then 1 mile takes 20 minutes.
- Therefore, her speed on the beach is 1 mile per 20 minutes.

Next, let's determine her speed on the sidewalk:
- Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 1 mile per 10 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
- At a speed of 1 mile per 10 minutes, it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Finally, let's add the times together to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
- Time on the beach: 40 minutes
- Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
- Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

"To figure out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, let's start by calculating how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. So, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then multiply these probabilities together.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability of winning is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. The probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos.
   - So, Carlos collected \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - So, Carrey collected \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells:**
   - Jim: 27 seashells
   - Carlos: 22 seashells
   - Carrey: 11 seashells
   - Total: \( 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \) seashells

4. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:**

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land. Here's the breakdown of his sales:

1. He sold half of the land for $50:
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - After this sale, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his original land for $30:
   - 1/4 of the original 80 square meters is 20 square meters.
   - After this sale, he has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

3. He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
   - The total from this sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60

Total earnings = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per book:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - Therefore, the cost per book is \( \frac{500}{100} = 5 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Since each book costs $5, the total number of books Bob can buy is \( \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \) books.

3. **Distribute the books equally among the 3 schools:**
   - To find out how many books each school gets, divide the total number of books by 3: \( \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \) books.

So, Bob can buy \(\boxed{1800}\) books per school."
"Let's go through the sequence of events step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices is:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.

So, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices is:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

So, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production.
   - Time required = Total snowballs needed / Net snowballs made per hour
   - Time required = 60 / 12 = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total distance all four dogs need to walk together. Since the average distance each dog needs to walk is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs, the total distance is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the distances the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

So, the total distance for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:
- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.
- Therefore, the total number of balloons is \(10 \times 30 = 300\).

Next, let's subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon:
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
- Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is \(300 - 12 = 288\).

So, the number of balloons they threw is 288.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to determine the amount of each medicine in one dose:
- The first medicine is 14 mL.
- The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

Next, we add these amounts to find the total amount of medicine in one dose:
- Total for one dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the total for one dose by 8:
- Total for 8 doses = 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the relationships given in the question:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

Let's denote:
- The number of paintings Kim has as \( K \),
- The number of paintings Shelley has as \( S \),
- The number of paintings Samantha has as \( M \).

From the information provided:
- \( M = 27 \)
- \( M = S - 12 \)
- \( S = K + 8 \)

First, we can substitute \( M = 27 \) into the equation \( M = S - 12 \):
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, we substitute \( S = 39 \) into the equation \( S = K + 8 \):
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, let's break down the capacity of each bookcase first:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Adding these together, each bookcase can hold \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's figure out how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's determine how much Rose will earn from selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. So, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:

Number of sets = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Each set of 3 eggs sells for $1, so:

Total earnings = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we start by calculating the sale price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it is $3.00 off, so the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we divide the sale price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick. There are 30 sticks in the bag, so:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is:

"Sure, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"Hi there! I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

2. Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67.
   - Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

So, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the costs and the number of days the restaurant is open.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total cost per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the watermelons.
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Calculate the total profit.
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price.
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon.
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora, so he is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Age of John's Youngest Son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Age of John's Youngest Son in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:
8"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the peeling rate for Ana:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Determine the peeling rate for Jane:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

First, the cost of the radiator with the discount:
The original price of the radiator is $400, and he gets it for 80% off. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to get the price he pays for the radiator:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator:
The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
230"
"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. The total number of legs is 70. We need to find out how many of the animals are chickens.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we have:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
