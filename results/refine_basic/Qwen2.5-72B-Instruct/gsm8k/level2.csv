"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Janet has each day. Her ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, which totals 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily.

Subtracting the eggs used from the total eggs laid, we get:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs remaining.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount she makes is:
9 * 2 = $18.

Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow a series of arithmetic steps, focusing on the percentages and the total costs involved.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original value ($80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different segments of John's journey and calculate the distances for each segment.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled back home = 135 miles.
   - Final distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time required to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the 12-mile trail:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles, totaling 2 hours so far. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To determine the original price of the book before the discount, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid, $19.50, represents 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount). 

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the given information:

- Henry's total trip is 60 miles.
- He made his first stop after 20 miles.
- He made his second stop 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, calculate the position of the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve the problem, let's define the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know the cost of one pair of high heels is \( $33 \). The cost of the other pair of high heels is twice this amount, which is \( 2 \times 33 = $66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we start by calculating each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we find the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as \( R \), the number of jewels Aaron has as \( A \), and the number of jewels Siobhan has as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Raymond has 40 jewels, so \( R = 40 \).
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so \( A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \).
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so \( S = A - 2 \).

First, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[
A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:
\[
S = A - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   - Add the points from both periods:

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then divide the distance by the time.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.
2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends running each week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Average Speed**:
   - Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
   \[
   400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

2. Add 140 to both sides to isolate \( x \):

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to determine the total amount John spent on ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties John bought as \( b \) and the number of red ties as \( r \).

Given:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties: \( r = 2b \).
- The cost of each blue tie is $40.
- John spent $200 on blue ties.
- The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie.

First, we calculate the number of blue ties John bought:
\[
\text{Total spent on blue ties} = \text{Number of blue ties} \times \text{Cost per blue tie}
\]
\[
200 = b \times 40
\]
\[
b = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we determine the number of red ties:
\[
r = 2b = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of each red tie:
\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie}
\]
\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie}
\]
\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we find the total amount spent on all ties:
\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties}
\]
\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back, we need to use the relationship between distance, rate, and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels during his initial trip:
- Tom's ship travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour.
- He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
- Therefore, the distance he travels is:
  \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour:
- The distance to travel back is the same, 30 miles.
- The rate for the return trip is 6 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the time it takes to travel back is:
  \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Thus, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the 7.5 pounds from the comic books, he still needs to remove:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of geometric sequences. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. Here, the common ratio is \( \frac{1}{2} \) because each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
- The common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).

We need to find the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. **4th level**: \( a_4 = 16 \)
2. **3rd level**: \( a_3 = a_4 \times 2 = 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
3. **2nd level**: \( a_2 = a_3 \times 2 = 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
4. **1st level**: \( a_1 = a_2 \times 2 = 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the relationships given in the problem using algebraic expressions.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we can express Sarah's laundry as:
\[ S = 4D \]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[ S = 400 \]

Substituting \( S = 400 \) into the equation \( S = 4D \):
\[ 400 = 4D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can express Raymond's laundry as:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2}S \]

Substituting \( S = 400 \) into the equation \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \):
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = R - D \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To determine the most cost-effective way for Vincent to buy 18 flowers, let's compare the two options:

1. **Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50:**
   - Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars

2. **Packages of 2 flowers for $1:**
   - Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - Total cost: \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars

By comparing the total costs, we see that buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 is cheaper than buying them in packages of 3 for $2.50.

To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of the cheaper option from the cost of the more expensive option:
\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won and \( L \) represent the number of games lost.

We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald's record sold. According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can express the number of copies Marilyn's record sold as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Simplifying the right side, we find:

\[ H = 8,000 \]

Thus, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

- James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James and Corey to find Corey's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can use Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, focusing on the relationship between Lee's and Gerald's times and the impact of Gerald's improved speed.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - Gerald's improved time is \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to express the relationships given and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote:
- \( d \) as the number of dogs,
- \( c \) as the number of cats,
- \( r \) as the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of dogs \( d = 60 \).
2. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so \( c = 2d \).
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( r = d + c - 12 \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[ c = 2d = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ r = d + c - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we find the total number of pets by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = d + c + r = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"To solve this problem, we'll start by determining the number of boys and girls in Grade 5, and then find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts.

1. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   - Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the number of girls in the Girl Scouts:**
   - Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts:**
   - The number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is:
\[
40

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, given that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked and each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes.

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes:**
   - Since the volume is halved when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - The sauce volume is 32 ounces, so the initial volume of tomatoes is:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - The number of cans used is:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - The total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
   - 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. **Cars Taking an Exit**: 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by each of Jerome's friends and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}

"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read each day over the next 4 days, we first calculate the total number of pages he needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining number of pages is:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

He has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average.

"To solve this problem, we need to use proportional reasoning to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Given:
- The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
- The city is 42 miles across.

First, we set up the proportion to find the total time \( T \) it will take to cover 42 miles:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{T \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( T \):

\[
3 \text{ miles} \times T \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
3T = 420
\]

\[
T = \frac{420}{3}
\]

\[
T = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}

"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of a single box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

Each box has an outer dimension of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, which means we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

- Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 3 = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, Henry actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, and he was left with 110 cookies. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

Since he dropped 5 cookies, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

Thus, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine the final cost of gas after applying the cashback, we need to follow a straightforward arithmetic process:

1. Calculate the total cost of gas before any cashback:
   - The price per gallon is $3.00.
   - The number of gallons purchased is 10.
   - Total cost before cashback = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00.

2. Calculate the total cashback:
   - The cashback per gallon is $0.20.
   - The number of gallons purchased is 10.
   - Total cashback = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00.

3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost before cashback:
   - Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Thus, the final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

"To determine the total amount of water that entered Julia's boat by the time she reached the shore, we need to use proportional reasoning and unit conversions.

First, let's establish the rate at which water enters the boat:
- The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.

Next, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know:
- It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.

We can calculate her rowing speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

With the total distance rowed, we can determine the total amount of water that entered the boat. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet:
\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that entered the boat by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we apply the 40% increase to Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step, focusing on the arithmetic involved.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   - Add the hours from all the days together.
   - Total: \(8 + 12 + 28 = 48\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her running speeds at different intervals.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \).

2. **Next 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie's speed decreases to 5 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \).

3. **Total distance:**
   - Adding the distances from both intervals: \( 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the initial conditions and the actions taken by Jennie. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. 

First, we calculate one-third of 60:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. After stamping these 20 letters, she adds them to the pile of already-stamped letters. The problem states that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

To find out how many letters were already in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the 20 letters she added from the current total of 30:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

1. Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After these actions, Julia had 12 spoons left.

We can express the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband's contribution and before using any for sampling as:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons left is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 \]

We know that this equals 12:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we start by identifying the quantities of each type of sausage. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles.
   - Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total earnings from inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total earnings in cents are:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total earnings in dollars are:
\[
500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

   - The number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. **Raccoon Stole Two-Thirds of the Remaining Fries:**
   - The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - The number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

6. **Ants Carried Off One Fry:**
   - After the ants took one fry, the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

7. **Five Fries Were Left:**
   - According to the problem, 5 fries were left.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
     \]

8. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Add 1 to both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3:
     \[
     x - 30 = 18
     \]
   - Add 30 to both sides:
     \[
     x = 48
     \]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Kimo has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Kimo has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
- The total number of hours per week is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the entire semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- Therefore, the total number of hours for the semester is \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Sum the lengths of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes over a period of 2 months. 

First, let's determine the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Next, we sum these monthly requirements to find the total monthly banana requirement:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total requirement for 2 months:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.

"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of exponential growth.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Exponential Growth Formula:**
   - The formula for the final price after a certain number of increases is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Calculation:**
   - Using a calculator to compute \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore, the final price is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $766.75.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.
- Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of crabs Bo has.
- \( M \) as the number of crabs Monic has.
- \( R \) as the number of crabs Rani has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Bo has 40 crabs, so \( B = 40 \).
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so \( M = B - 4 \).
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so \( R = M + 10 \).

First, we substitute \( B = 40 \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[
M = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, we substitute \( M = 36 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[
B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

Now that we know \( C = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses ordered:
\[
4C = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Since Fred has not delivered any red roses yet, he must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Therefore, the number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information provided:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]

3. **Solve the second equation for \( M \):**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

4. **Substitute \( M \) back into the first equation to find \( J \):**
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 21 + 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 23
   \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning margin between the two teams in the 4 by 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race.

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds.
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

The difference in their total times is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To address the question, we need to calculate the probabilities of two distinct events and then determine the relative likelihood of one event compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Comparing the Probabilities
To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

### Final Answer:
200%"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break down the information and set up the equations step by step.

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

The cost to the trader for each bag, including the purchase and transportation, is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars per bag} \]

The selling price per bag is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars per bag} \]

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars per bag} \]

The total profit made by the trader is given as $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the costs and then determine how much each friend paid.

1. **Cost of the tickets:**
   - The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.

2. **Cost of the food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - Therefore, the cost of the food is:
     \[
     20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
     \]

3. **Cost of the rides:**
   - They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
     \[

4. **Total cost:**
   - Adding up all the costs:
     \[
     20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing the total weekly amount by 7 days:

\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the final number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into algebraic expressions and then solve for the unknown, which is the cost of each cup.

Given:
- Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.

First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this amount:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost per cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups:
\[ 20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Let \( c \) be the cost of each cup. The total cost of 240 cups is:
\[ 240c = 34800 \]

To find \( c \), we solve the equation:
\[ c = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information and find the number of red chickens Jerry has.

Let \( R \) represent the number of red chickens and \( W \) represent the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, given the total number of customers over three days and the counts for the first two days.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250 = 250

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool (in gallons), and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool (in gallons).

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons leaked out in 4 minutes), and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
\[ 2S + 16 = 32 \]
Subtract 16 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 16 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount due**

Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months**

Janeth will pay $165 each month for 12 months. The total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance**

The remaining balance is the total amount due minus the total amount paid:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias is:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 7 = 11 \text{ dahlias} \]

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 11 \text{ dahlias} = 15 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack using algebraic expressions based on the given information.

1. Let \( H \) represent Harriet's current age. According to the problem, \( H = 21 \).

2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   A = 3H
   \]
   Substituting \( H = 21 \):
   \[
   A = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]

3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   H = \frac{Z}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \( Z \):
   \[
   Z = 2H
   \]
   Substituting \( H = 21 \):
   \[
   Z = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45
  \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{(H + 3) + (A + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we first need to calculate the new total number of cards and the new number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

The new total number of cards is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, the total number of letters he receives each week is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

3. **Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since Mike responds in kind, he needs to write 5 pages for each of the 6 letters.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to write is \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \).

4. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \( 30 \times 6 = 180 \) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is \( \frac{180}{60} = 3 \).

Thus, Mike spends \(\boxed{3}\) hours writing letters each week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total minutes Jason has used and then subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Fries:**
   Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Fries Taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin has 19 fries left.

3. **Fries Taken by Billy:**
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy takes 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin has 9 fries left.

4. **Fries Given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin.

5. **Fries Taken by Colby:**
   Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby takes 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Last Night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.
     \[
     \text{Cougars killed today} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem.

Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has. We are given the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

4. Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[ A_a = 52 \]

First, we substitute the value of \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( J_a \):
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the value of \( J_a \) to find \( J_b \):
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

\text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170
\]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[
\text{Remaining stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
\]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum these times.

1. **Calculate the time for small holes:**
   - Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes: 30
   - Total time for small holes: \( 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Calculate the time for large holes:**
   - Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes: 15
   - Total time for large holes: \( 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Sum the total times:**

"To solve this problem, we start with the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages, which is equivalent to adding 20 years to their current total age.

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (10 years for each person) = 40

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve the problem, let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand the right-hand side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Now, isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

2. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones occupy 8 inches. Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of beads that fit into the remaining 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:
     \[
     \frac{17}{0.25} = 68
     \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over two weeks, with each doubling their output in the second week.

First, let's determine the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we calculate the total number of stories each wrote over the two weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

Thus, the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether is 360."
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the current ages of Ann and her brother. Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age. Therefore, her brother is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

1 quarter = 25 cents
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Adding these together, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the speeds of the cars and the distance traveled. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

The distance both cars travel is the same, 480 miles. We need to find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover this distance. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the 480 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra to find the total number of medals given out for counting.

Let \( A \) represent the number of medals Ali has, and \( I \) represent the number of medals Izzy has. According to the problem:

1. Ali has 22 medals:
   \[
   A = 22
   \]

2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali:
   \[
   I = A - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 22 \):
   \[
   I = 22 - 5 = 17
   \]

3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out. Let \( T \) represent the total number of medals given out. Therefore:
   \[
   A + I = \frac{T}{10}
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 22 \) and \( I = 17 \):
   \[
   22 + 17 = \frac{T}{10}
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   39 = \frac{T}{10}
   \]

4. To find \( T \), multiply both sides by 10:
   \[
   T = 39 \times 10 = 390
   \]

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[
\boxed{390}

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will receive. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will receive:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total working time and then apply her earning rate.

1. **Total Time Worked:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a span of 3 hours.
   - She takes a 30-minute break during this period.
   - Therefore, the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. **Convert Working Time to Minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

3. **Calculate Earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes.
   - The number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes is 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.
   - Therefore, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to account for the extra points given in the fourth round. Each player who has more than 20 points gets an additional point:

- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

83"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the ages of Will's two sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half the age of the oldest, which is 4 years old. 

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges bought: 15 - 12 = 3.

Thus, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

**Day 2:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum the totals for each type of exercise over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we add these totals together to get the overall total count of activities:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household over a period of time and then determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total rice consumption per meal for the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

   Since they eat rice twice a day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the total rice consumption per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The household consumes 14 kg of rice per week.

   Therefore, the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

   - Since Watson works 5 days each week, the total number of working days in April is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) days (since we consider only full weeks for simplicity).

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 20 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 200 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2000 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2000.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2000 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3200 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"To determine how many people John loses to, we start by calculating the number of people he beats. Given that John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can find this number by calculating 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beats 16 people. Since he arm wrestles a total of 20 people, the number of people he loses to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Thus, John loses to 4 people.

"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning. Given that the bakery produces 60 loaves each day and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[ \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we first need to understand the rate at which each person loses weight.

1. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use her weekly weight loss rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve the problem of how many new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days, we need to break it down into two parts: the growth of new arms and the growth of new legs.

1. **Growth of New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new arms grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **Growth of New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new legs grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total Number of New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and the number of new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Therefore, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"To determine how much Theo can spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract this from the amount he wishes to spend after saving.

1. **Calculate the cost of the business suits:**
   - 6 suits * $100/suit = $600

2. **Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**
   - 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - 5 * $100 = $500
   - $500 + $700 = $1200

4. **Sum up all the expenses:**
   - $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

5. **Determine the amount Theo plans to spend after saving:**
   - Theo wants to save $2000 from his $6000.
   - $6000 - $2000 = $4000

6. **Calculate the remaining amount for gifts:**
   - $4000 (planned spending) - $1950 (total expenses) = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption:

- Three family members each eat 3 eggs per day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two family members each eat 2 eggs per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:
\[ 9 + 4 = 13 \text{ eggs per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( Q \) represent Quinn's age.
2. Let \( J \) represent Jane's age.
3. Let \( T \) represent Trent's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Quinn is 30 years old: \( Q = 30 \)
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: \( J = Q - 3 \)
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane: \( T = J + 5 \)

First, substitute \( Q = 30 \) into the equation for Jane's age:
\[ J = 30 - 3 \]
\[ J = 27 \]

Next, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the equation for Trent's age:
\[ T = 27 + 5 \]
\[ T = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to express the relationships given and then solve for the unknowns. Let's denote the current population of Chile as \( P \).

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, \( 60000 = \frac{P}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( P \), we get \( P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \( 120000 \).

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step, focusing on the arithmetic and fractions involved.

1. **Initial Marbles:**
   Solomon initially has 50 marbles in his store.

2. **Marbles Bought:**
   Solomon buys 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. Adding these to his initial store:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. **Marbles from Father:**
   Solomon's father gives him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. First, we calculate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of 20:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{2 \times 20}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]
   Adding these 8 marbles to the total:
   \[
   70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to express the relationships given and then solve for the total number of children in the classroom.

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the number of boys.
- \( G \) as the number of girls.
- \( N \) as the number of nongendered children.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of boys \( B = 30 \).
2. The number of girls \( G \) is 3 times the number of boys, so \( G = 3B \).
3. The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys, so \( N = \frac{1}{10}B \).

First, substitute the value of \( B \) into the equations for \( G \) and \( N \):
- \( G = 3 \times 30 = 90 \)
- \( N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \)

Now, we can find the total number of children by summing the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[
\text{Total number of children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
\]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
3x = 45

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils each of Jam's boxes contains. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the proportional relationships and unit conversions involved in cooling the coffee and the resulting weakening effect.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the bus at each stop and determine how many people initially got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time required to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. 

First, determine the remaining percentage of charge needed:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required in minutes is:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour = 60 minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we start by calculating the total number of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we can find this number by multiplying 220 by 40% (or 0.40):

\[
220 \times 0.40 = 88 \text{ ruined castles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we divide the number of ruined castles by 2:

\[
88 \div 2 = 44 \text{ unmanned ruined castles}
\]

Thus, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times as many hot dogs as Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]
3. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate compared to Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:
\[
3 - 2 = 1

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 students fewer than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

Now, we find the number of students in the smallest group:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of cows and \( h \) represent the number of chickens.

1. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   c + h = 60
   \]

2. There are twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   h = 2c
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( c \):
\[
c + 2c = 60
\]
\[
3c = 60
\]
\[
c = 20
\]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[
h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs:
\[
\text{Total legs from cows} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]
\[
\text{Total legs from chickens} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: Josh starts juggling with 3 balls.
2. **Weekly Progress**: Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. **After 4 Weeks**: After 4 weeks, he has added 4 more balls to his initial 3 balls. So, he is juggling 3 + 4 = 7 balls.
4. **Talent Show Incident**: On stage, Josh drops 3 balls.
5. **Balls Caught**: 2 of the dropped balls are caught and returned to him.
6. **Balls Lost**: 1 ball is lost completely.

Now, let's calculate the number of balls Josh has left to juggle:

- Initially, he has 7 balls.
- He drops 3 balls, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left.
- 2 balls are caught and returned, so he has 4 + 2 = 6 balls.
- 1 ball is lost, so he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls.

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 5 balls.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, so both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run by 1/5, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000 meters"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

Thus, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( M \) represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks. According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

Next, let \( S \) represent the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. The problem states that \( S = 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
\[ S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Now, let \( V \) represent the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that \( V = 3S \). Substituting \( S = 7 \):
\[ V = 3(7) = 21 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. Let \( O \) represent the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out can be expressed as:
\[ M + S + V + O = 50 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 31 + O = 50 \]

Solving for \( O \):
\[ O = 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times as many points as Sara, who has 8 points.

The equation can be written as:
\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So the equation simplifies to:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

Next, solve for \( E \) by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the sales for each day and account for the returns.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Next, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Milk from the first half of the sheep:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep, so half of them is 15 sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 1 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from the first half is \( 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg} \).

2. **Milk from the second half of the sheep:**
   - The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 2 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from the second half is \( 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg} \).

3. **Total milk collected:**
   - Adding the milk from both halves, the total milk collected every day is \( 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \).

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 45 kg.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest is calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has based on the information given about Axel's pesos.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together to get the total number of pesos:

"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use algebra to set up and solve an equation. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

Given that Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining. According to the problem, the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the performance is with just the female members, we initially have 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

Thus, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16."

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11.

Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of millipedes**: She saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of bug:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( E \) represent Erica's age.
Let \( B \) represent Beth's age.
Let \( A \) represent Alice's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = E + 5 \) (Beth is 5 years older than Erica)
2. \( A = B + 7 \) (Alice is 7 years older than Beth)
3. \( E = 30 \) (Erica is 30 years old)

First, substitute \( E = 30 \) into the first equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 35 \) into the second equation to find \( A \):
\[ A = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[ A - E = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"To determine the energy savings, we start by calculating the energy used by the air conditioner in its original and reduced usage scenarios.

1. **Original Daily Energy Usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If it runs for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Reduced Daily Energy Usage:**
   - If the usage time is reduced by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Daily Energy Savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily usage:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. **Convert Daily Energy Savings to Kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **Total Energy Savings Over 30 Days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the total energy savings in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the meat and cheese required to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches required = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cannolis and \( K \) represent the number of corns.

1. Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis:
   \[
   C = 40
   \]

2. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis:
   \[
   K = 2C
   \]
   Substituting \( C = 40 \):
   \[
   K = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
   \[
   C_{\text{new}} = C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

4. Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   K_{\text{new}} = C_{\text{new}} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

5. The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = C_{\text{new}} + K_{\text{new}} = 100 + 60 = 160

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We know the following:

- Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps.
- He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
- He did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ (goal)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left)} = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the total steps he had taken by the end of his jog:

\[ 8,000 \text{ (total steps by the end of jog)} - 6,000 \text{ (steps before jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the calculations for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

First, calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the monthly payment for one employee:
\[ 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/month} \]

Now, calculate the total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

The weekly payment for one employee remains the same:
\[ 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

The monthly payment for one employee remains the same:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/month} \]

Now, calculate the total payment for all employees in June:

"To address this problem, we need to apply basic principles of probability. Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means there is a 1% chance that any given candle will explode. Out of the candles that do explode, 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:

\[
\text{Probability of a candle exploding} = 0.01
\]
\[
\text{Total number of candles} = 50000
\]
\[
\text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. The probability of an exploding candle having this defect is 5%:

\[
\text{Probability of an exploding candle smelling like wet dog} = 0.05
\]
\[
\text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25

"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price per blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

First, let's calculate the discount amount per blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we find the discounted price per blouse by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price.

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses by multiplying the discounted price by the number of blouses.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathered half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
- Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Her sister gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister did not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of apples:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We now have a system of two linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
C + D = 180 \\
2C + D = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[
124 + D = 180
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into distinct segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - The distance traveled over the next 2 days is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to Lillian's garden by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the price of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4

"To solve the problem, let's denote the total number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5.

The total amount of money Kenny makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total money he makes is:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Setting up the equation:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]

To solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6. 

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the letters in Indras' name and her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after applying the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as \( x \).

1. **Total amount spent:**
   - George had $5 initially and had 1% of his money left, which is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The total cost for the candy bars is \( 0.75x \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total amount spent on chips and candy bars is the sum of the costs of the chips and the candy bars.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     1.20 + 0.75x = 4.95
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 1.20 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     0.75x = 4.95 - 1.20
     \]
     \[
     0.75x = 3.75
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.75:
     \[
     x = \frac{3.75}{0.75}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we start by calculating the weight of each piece. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have eaten is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting this from the original weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We are given that the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an algebraic equation based on the given information.

1. **Cost of the super ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20 and includes the movie, one popcorn, and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - The movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     15 + P = 19

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the original cost of filling one helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon went up by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. To find the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price, we calculate:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
11050

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
     \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:
- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8 sapphires)
- 2 rubies

The value of the 5 remaining sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of all her jewels is:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To determine the total number of cards, we start by calculating the number of each color of card based on the given information.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Next, we sum the number of cards of all colors:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, with 3 of them having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, with 4 of them having spots.

First, we find the total number of puppies:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of spotted puppies:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of spotted puppies, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given conditions into an algebraic equation. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Thus, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, the combined length is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion from set theory. This principle helps us avoid double-counting the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Let's define the sets:
- Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the union of sets \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 32 \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of oranges Stetson ate. Given that Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we have:

\[
\text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of the shoes as \( S \). According to the problem, the cost of the handbag is $20 less than three times the cost of the shoes. This can be expressed algebraically as:

\[ \text{Cost of the handbag} = 3S - 20 \]

Given that the cost of the shoes \( S \) is $80, we substitute \( S \) with 80 in the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of the handbag} = 3(80) - 20 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication and subtraction:

\[ \text{Cost of the handbag} = 240 - 20 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the handbag} = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

"To solve the problem of determining how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for all four horses is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
     \]

Thus, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given.

Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.

We know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so in four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \).

According to the problem, in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age:
\[
A + 4 = 3 \times 14
\]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
A + 4 = 42
\]

Next, solve for \( A \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
A = 42 - 4
\]
\[
A = 38

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up and solve an algebraic equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
   \[ L + D + B = 43 \]
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
   \[ L = D + 7 \]
3. David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.
   \[ D = \frac{1}{2}B \]

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation to find the cost of the headphone set and then determine how many additional CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the cost of one CD.
- \( H \) as the cost of the headphone set.
- \( T \) as the total amount Tom spent.

From the problem, we know:
- \( C = 4 \) dollars.
- \( T = 48 \) dollars.

The total amount spent can be expressed as:
\[ T = C + H \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 48 = 4 + H \]

To find \( H \), we solve for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. The number of additional CDs, \( N \), can be calculated as:
\[ N = \frac{H}{C} \]
\[ N = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ N = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Routine**: Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. **Variations**:
   - For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each week.
   - For 1 week, he spent 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the number of weeks he followed his regular routine:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks with 5 hours: 2
- Week with 6 hours: 1
- Weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent Jame's current age, and \( C \) represent his cousin's current age.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, \( J + 5 = 27 \).
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( J + 8 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Therefore, \( C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5 \).

3. **Substitute Jame's current age into the equation:**
   - Since \( J = 22 \), we substitute \( 22 \) for \( J \):
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
     \]
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2(30) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 55 - 8 = 47
     \]

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( C - J \):
     \[
     C - J = 47 - 22 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.
3. The computer costs $1,100.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. \( C = 1100 \)

First, substitute the value of \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation to find \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the bill is split evenly, each person would normally pay half of the original $50:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, since you are responsible for the entire tip, you need to add the $10 tip to your half of the bill:

$25 + $10 = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the daily savings amount for the second half of April, given that Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half of April is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total savings for each half of the month:**
   - The first half of April has 15 days, so the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).
   - The second half of April also has 15 days, so the total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

4. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives \( 4B \).

The total amount of money to be divided is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total amount:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now that we know Brad receives 20 dollars, we can determine how much Jeff receives by calculating \( 4B \):

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Thus, Jeff receives 80 dollars.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **First, Elise writes the full alphabet twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half once: \(13\) letters.

3. **Then, she re-writes everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Rewriting all 65 letters: \(65\) letters.

4. **Finally, we sum up all the letters she has written:**
   - Total letters: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the weights of each individual:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent Shiloh's current age and \( N \) represent his nephew's current age.

We know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the payments the tooth fairy made to Sharon for each tooth she lost.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount per tooth as she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00 per tooth, half of that is:
   \[
   0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, the total is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}

2. \( R = M + 20 \) (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
3. \( R = A + 45 \) (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)

First, we can use the first equation to substitute \( R \) in the other equations:
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]

Next, solve for \( M \) and \( A \):
\[ M = 80 - 20 = 60 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

"To determine the average number of birds Mack saw each day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds observed. Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Summing these values gives us the total number of birds:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw each day is 40.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the initial value of the number train as \( x = 20 \).

1. Calculate half of the number: 
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. Add this half to the starting value:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. Divide the result by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. Subtract 12 from the starting value:
   \[
   x - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]

5. Multiply the results from steps 3 and 4:
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Thus, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \).

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to use proportional reasoning to determine the correct setting for achieving a desired temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by a consistent percentage.

First, let's establish the relationship between the set temperature and the actual temperature. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. This means the oven is running 18 degrees hotter than the set temperature.

To find the percentage increase:
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This 4% increase is consistent for any temperature setting. Therefore, if Maggie wants the oven to reach 520 degrees, we need to find the set temperature \( x \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees.

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Actual temperature} = \text{Set temperature} \times (1 + 0.04)
\]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[
520 = x \times 1.04
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Thus, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the durations of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours = 120 minutes.
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies:
- 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Thus, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To determine the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we start by calculating the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

First, we find 30% of Herb's house value:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill based on the hours they worked and the rate of pay, which is $10 per hour.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill.

   - Calories burned per hour: 500 calories
   - Total calories burned from aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)

2. **Running:**
   - Time spent: 1 hour
   - Calories burned per hour: 600 calories
   - Total calories burned from running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

3. **Total calories burned:**
   - Total calories burned from both activities: \(1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\)

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the beanstalk. The beanstalk doubles its height every day, starting from an initial height of 4 feet. We need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The height of the beanstalk can be expressed as:
\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, we solve the inequality:
\[ 2^n > \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Next, we find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \): \( 2^0 = 1 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 2^1 = 2 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \) (greater than 5)

Thus, \( n = 3 \) is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality. Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed algebraically as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

2. Subtract \( J \) from both sides to isolate the variable:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

3. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For four hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Next Two Hours:**
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour}
  \]
- For two hours, the total earnings are:
  \[
  6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Total Earnings:**
- Adding the earnings from both periods:
  \[
  30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow a series of arithmetic and unit conversion steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Therefore, the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will take to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. 

First, we calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Total cost before discount: \( 25 + 35 = 60 \).

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
- Discounted total: \( 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \).

Finally, we subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money:
- Joe has $50.
- Amount left after purchase: \( 50 - 42 = 8 \).

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for the additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional 45 months cost

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the amounts of meat each player who ordered meat consumed.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of seats in the auditorium. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of remaining seats, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to find the total price for all three jewels. Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of the gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of the silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel \( D \) is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel \( G \) is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel \( S \) is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel \( G \):
\[
G = \frac{4}{5} \times D
\]
Substituting \( D = 2000 \):
\[
G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel \( S \):
\[
S = G - 400
\]
Substituting \( G = 1600 \):
\[
S = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total Price} = D + G + S
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \)."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed in algebra. The key is to determine how quickly Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob.

1. **Identify the speeds and the initial distance:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 mph
   - Tom's speed: 70 mph
   - Initial distance between Tom and Bob: 75 miles

2. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is how fast Tom is catching up to Bob.
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

3. **Determine the time to catch up:**
   - The time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob is the initial distance divided by the relative speed.
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by calculating the daily and weekly customer processing rates for each of them.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we are told that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the distances each person ran in terms of algebraic expressions. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

Given:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran.
- Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

First, calculate the distance Reggie ran:
\[ \text{Distance Reggie ran} = 5 \times \text{Distance Paisley ran} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn:
\[ \text{Distance Reggie ran} = \text{Distance Lynn ran} + 3 \]
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), solve the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( R \) represent the sales from red hats, and \( G \) represent the sales from green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, and this amount is half the sales from green hats. Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = 400 \]
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From the second equation, we can solve for \( G \):
\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]
\[ G = 400 \times 2 \]
\[ G = 800 \]

Now, we calculate the total sales for the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = R + G = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find the total sales for the second month. The problem states that the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, we sum the total sales for both months:
\[ \text{Total sales for both months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of history teachers. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find this number by multiplying 150 by 60% (or 0.60):

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the total number of teachers is 150, the number of math teachers is:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the amounts of money each person has.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the amount of money Aurelia has.
- \( K \) as the amount of money Kassidy has.
- \( R \) as the amount of money Rayna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Aurelia has $120.
   \[
   A = 120
   \]
2. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
   \[
   K = \frac{3}{4}A
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 120 \):
   \[
   K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
   \]
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   \[
   R = K + 60
   \]
   Substituting \( K = 90 \):
   \[
   R = 90 + 60 = 150
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money they have together:
\[
\text{Total} = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360
\]

If they decide to share the total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:
\[
\text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120
\]

Thus, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"To determine the total duration of Sarah's basketball game, we start by calculating the time for the four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie, we add this extra time to the total:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Thus, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to calculate the sum of the flour, sugar, and salt required for each muffin and then multiply by the number of muffins.

For each muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

First, we calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins:
- Total flour: \( 5 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 80 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total sugar: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total salt: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \)

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of dry ingredients:
\[ 80 \text{ tablespoons} + 48 \text{ tablespoons} + 4 \text{ tablespoons} = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients needed to make 16 muffins is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of the days over the past 30 days is as follows:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

The next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and we know Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first isolate the term involving \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.

**Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.**
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet
- Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

**Step 2: Calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches.**
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Additional height needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

**Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.**
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. **First Change:**
   - 8 more dogs join the shelter.
   - Total dogs now: 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs.
   - Total toys after first purchase: 4 (initial) + 8 (bought) = 12 toys.

3. **Second Change:**
   - When James returns, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left.
   - Total dogs now: 12 (previous) * 2 = 24 dogs.
   - James needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs.
   - Total toys after second purchase: 12 (previous) + 12 (bought) = 24 toys.

4. **Third Change:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now: 24 (previous) - 3 (gone) = 21 dogs.
   - James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that are gone.
   - Total toys needed: 21 toys.

Since James already has 24 toys and only needs 21, he does not need to buy any more toys. However, the question asks for the total number of toys he needs, which is the number of toys he has after all the changes.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine Skyler's investment, we first need to break down the contributions of Dylan and Frances, and then find the remaining amount that Skyler invested.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   The total amount is $1200, and after Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   The remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments is:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

Thus, Skyler's investment is:
\[

"To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first add the number of signatures they currently have:

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:
\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by understanding the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can establish the ratio as follows:

\[ \text{Ratio of potatoes to hash browns} = \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{1 \text{ potato}}{6 \text{ hash browns}} \]

This means that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:

\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then determine how much this total exceeds the elevator's maximum load.

1. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
2. There are 9 people in total (Jack + 8 other adults).
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg. To find out how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to express the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, which we will denote as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To solve the problem, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Add the time for ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode.
   - \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( T \) represent the age of one of the twins, and \( R \) represent the age of one of the triplets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( L \) be the cost of one lollipop and \( C \) be the cost of one candy. We are given:
- \( L = 0.40 \) dollars
- Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20.

We can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 5L + 4C = 3.20 \]

Substituting the value of \( L \) into the equation:
\[ 5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20 \]
\[ 2.00 + 4C = 3.20 \]

Next, we solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C = 3.20 - 2.00 \]
\[ 4C = 1.20 \]
\[ C = \frac{1.20}{4} \]
\[ C = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. Using the values of \( L \) and \( C \):
\[ 10L + 10C = 10(0.40) + 10(0.30) \]
\[ 10L + 10C = 4.00 + 3.00 \]
\[ 10L + 10C = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we start by calculating their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. First, we calculate how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the services and then determine how much money John has left after paying the bill.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The heartworm check cost is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100

"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit based on the given unit prices and then sum these costs.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.50, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.50.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.00, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5.00
- Total cost for apples: $6.00
- Total cost for oranges: $21.00

The total price for the crate is \(5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Next, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs currently available
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then compare this total to the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of Adam's points:
   \[
   0.30 \times 50 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

"To determine how much money Greta has left to spend after her retirement and car payments, we start by calculating the amounts allocated to each.

1. **Retirement Account Contribution:**
   Greta contributes 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck to her retirement account.
   \[
   2400 \times 0.50 = 1200
   \]

2. **Car Payment:**
   Greta uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her monthly car payment.
   \[
   2400 \times 0.20 = 480
   \]

3. **Total Deductions:**
   We add the amounts for the retirement account and the car payment to find the total deductions.
   \[
   1200 + 480 = 1680
   \]

4. **Remaining Money:**
   Finally, we subtract the total deductions from her original paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.
   \[
   2400 - 1680 = 720
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given:

Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck in pounds.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul \( 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \) pounds.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

We can write the equation for the total capacity as:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \]

Now, solve for \( G \):
\[ 8,800 + G = 11,600 \]
\[ G = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ G = 2,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of dumplings each group of people ate. 

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the division of $100 in the ratio 3:2 between Gerald and Julia. This means that for every 5 parts (3 parts for Gerald and 2 parts for Julia), the total amount of $100 is divided.

First, we calculate the value of one part:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we determine Gerald's share:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Julia's share is:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book:
\[ \text{Money left with Gerald} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationship between the speeds of the cat and the turtle. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is given as 15 feet per second.

First, we calculate the turtle's speed:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to determine how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we start by calculating the rate at which they are raising money. 

Given:
- The goal is to raise $6300.
- After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

First, we find the amount raised per hour:
\[
\text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining $4200:
\[
\text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours needed:

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Total Water Usage by the City**: The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. **Industrial Water Usage**: 80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
3. **Non-Industrial Water Usage**: To find the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]"

"To determine Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount, we first calculate the total cost of each item he ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final total:

Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the deal and how it affects the total number of scoops Erin can get with her $6.00.

1. **Cost per scoop**: Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. **Deal**: Buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

First, let's determine how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) Erin can get with her $6.00.

- **Cost for 2 scoops**: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- **Number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy**: \(\frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2\) sets.

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we start by calculating the total amount of candy each person consumes over this period.

First, we calculate the total number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we determine how much candy each person has left after 14 days. Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

For Ginger:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

For Amy:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**

"To determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, we start by calculating the time each takes individually.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Next, we find the average time by summing the times and dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we first convert the feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet is equivalent to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship provided in the problem. The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given relationship is:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we start by calculating the total number of spools Candy has. 

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

First, we sum these quantities to find the total number of spools:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

Thus, the percentage of blue spools is:
40%"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we start with the initial number of people lined up at the polling station, which is 5000.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find this number, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means 2000 people had voted by midday. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find this number, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted between midday and 16:00. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) represent Dora's age, \( F \) represent Dora's father's age, and \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora's age \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age \( F \) is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
3. Dora's mother's age \( M \) is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of votes each candidate received based on the given percentages and additional information.

1. **Votes for Candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for Candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Votes for Candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than Candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for Candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Votes for Candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for Candidate A and Candidate B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for Candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Thus, Candidate C received 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Each gallon jar costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon jar costs $3, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the distribution of their hobbies. The class has 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students like either playing video games or playing music.

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of marbles each person has in terms of algebraic expressions.

Let \( S \) represent the number of marbles Sean has. According to the problem, Sean has 56 marbles:
\[ S = 56 \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, the number of marbles Carl has, \( C \), is:
\[ C = 4S \]
Substituting \( S = 56 \) into the equation:
\[ C = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, the number of marbles Cal has, \( L \), is:
\[ L = 2S \]
Substituting \( S = 56 \) into the equation:
\[ L = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, and \( A \) represent the number of votes against it.

We know two things:
1. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:
   \[
   F = 2A
   \]
2. The total number of votes is 33, which is the total number of people on the council:
   \[
   F + A = 33
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( A \):
\[
2A + A = 33
\]
\[
3A = 33
\]
\[
A = 11
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( F \) using the first equation:
\[
F = 2A
\]
\[
F = 2 \times 11
\]
\[
F = 22
\]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[
\boxed{22}

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of shirts required for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, focusing on the relationships between the fractions and the given numbers.

1. **Identify the number of Pomeranian girls:**
   - We are told that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   - Let \( P \) be the total number of Pomeranians.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1}{3}P = 6\).

2. **Solve for the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   P = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We are told that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of puppies.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{2}{3}T = 18\).

4. **Solve for the total number of puppies:**
   - To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

"To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first calculate the total amount of money he currently has. Jayden initially had $70. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Adding this to Jayden's initial amount:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation. Let's denote the price at which Bennet sells each ear of corn as \( x \).

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total revenue from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

He wants to make a total of $135. Therefore, the revenue from the 25 ears of corn must make up the difference:
\[ 60 + 25x = 135 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ 25x = 135 - 60 \]
\[ 25x = 75 \]
\[ x = \frac{75}{25} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Thus, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \( \boxed{3} \) dollars."

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the driving distance is:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The family hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - The hiking distance is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the total points each of them earns based on the given conditions and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

### Emma's Score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from timer: \( 30T \)
- Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

### Ava's Score:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B + 3 \)
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
- Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

### Difference in Scores:
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the different riding patterns over the week.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebra to determine how many white fish Bob bought. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( y \).

Given:
- Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.
- He bought 17 more fish in total.
- After adding these fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \) (twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish)

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start by understanding the fractions of the total sales that are smart TVs and analog TVs.

Given:
- Total TVs sold = 40
- Fraction of smart TVs = \(\frac{1}{4}\)
- Fraction of analog TVs = \(\frac{1}{8}\)

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25

"To determine how much money John is missing for his school trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the school's contribution, which is half of the total cost of the trip.
2. Subtract the school's contribution from the total cost to find out how much John needs to raise.
3. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school is covering half of this cost:
\[ \text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we subtract the school's contribution from the total cost to find out how much John needs to raise:
\[ \text{Amount John needs to raise} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John already has $50, so we subtract this from the amount he needs to raise:
\[ \text{Amount John is missing} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary cost for all employees over that period.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

First, let's calculate the number of students:
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 40 \times 25 = 1000 \).

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Now, let's calculate the number of teachers:
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \).

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we start by calculating the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- \( u \) be the amount of sugar in ounces.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( f = z \) (the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest)
2. \( s = 2z \) (the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest)
3. \( u = s \) (the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt)
4. \( o = 2s \) (the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt)

We also know that the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + o + u = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 2s \]
\[ s = 2z \]
\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( 4 \) ounces.

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Thus, John spent a total of $4500.

"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we start by adding the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes he already has:

8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number required:

63 cupcakes - 48 cupcakes = 15 cupcakes.

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the initial number of cars Joe has. Given that Robert has 20 cars and Joe has twice as many, we calculate Joe's initial number of cars as follows:

\[ \text{Joe's initial cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ \text{Cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Therefore, the number of cars given away is:

\[ \text{Cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars sold and given away from his initial number of cars:

\[ \text{Cars remaining} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much each of the 20 students raised. Since the students raised a total of $125,000 and there are 20 students, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over two days and then convert that time into minutes.

1. **First Day:**
   - Sandy walked for 8 hours.

2. **Second Day:**
   - She walked half as many hours as she did on the first day.
   - Half of 8 hours is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

3. **Total Time in Hours:**
   - Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
   - Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

4. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60.
   - Total time in minutes = 12 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach using basic arithmetic operations.

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.
2. **First Break Count**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Lunch Break**: When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. To find out how many cars left, we calculate half of 70:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. **Remaining Cars**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is the total number of cars after the first break minus the number of cars that left:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of Magic Cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P \), we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how this affects the time it takes to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to express the relationships between the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

Let's denote:
- \( K \) as the number of dishes Kora made.
- \( R \) as the number of dishes Rory made.
- \( J \) as the number of dishes Jada made.

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, substitute \( K = 20 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 20 + 20 = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[
J = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the contributions and the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current daily milk production:

- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- The farmer has 3 cows.

Thus, the current daily milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the total cost:

Money needed = Total cost - Total amount Gabriel has
Money needed = $10,800 - $5,200
Money needed = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, which can be calculated as:

4 * $20 = $80

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount of money Craig has initially. He has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which gives him:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( J_s \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- \( J_d \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- \( P_s \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- \( P_d \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes:
   \[
   J_d = 60
   \]

2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks:
   \[
   J_d = 2 \times J_s
   \]
   Substituting \( J_d = 60 \):
   \[
   60 = 2 \times J_s \implies J_s = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
   \[
   P_s = 2 \times J_s = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
   \[
   P_d = \frac{1}{2} \times J_d = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[
\text{Total socks} = J_s + P_s = 30 + 60 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total dishes} = J_d + P_d = 60 + 30 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180
\]

Thus, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"In the context of set theory, we can represent the students in Miss Susan's class using sets. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( M \) be the set of students good at math.
- Let \( E \) be the set of students good at English.

We are given:
- The total number of students in the class, \( |M \cup E| = 20 \).
- The number of students good at math only, \( |M - E| = 5 \).
- The number of students good at English only, \( |E - M| = 8 \).

We need to find the number of students good at math, which is \( |M| \).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the union of two sets, we have:
\[ |M \cup E| = |M| + |E| - |M \cap E| \]

We also know:
\[ |M| = |M - E| + |M \cap E| \]
\[ |E| = |E - M| + |M \cap E| \]

From the given information:
\[ |M - E| = 5 \]
\[ |E - M| = 8 \]
\[ |M \cup E| = 20 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of students good at both math and English, i.e., \( |M \cap E| = x \).

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
\[ 20 = (5 + x) + (8 + x) - x \]
\[ 20 = 5 + x + 8 + x - x \]
\[ 20 = 13 + x \]
\[ x = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( |M| \):
\[ |M| = |M - E| + |M \cap E| \]
\[ |M| = 5 + 7 \]
\[ |M| = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is \( 12 \).

"To determine the number of groups that can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the total concert time and the intermission:
- Total concert duration: 2 hours
- Convert hours to minutes: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \)
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Total time available for performances:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the total available time by the time required per group:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

1. **Identify the principal (P):**
   \( P = 300 \) dollars

2. **Identify the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Identify the time (t):**
   \( t = 3 \) years

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 202500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A):**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500
   \]
   \[
   A = 202800 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we will use basic arithmetic and set theory to determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of these shirts have collars.
   - Number of white shirts with collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts with no collars:**
   - Total white shirts = 40.
   - White shirts with collars = 20.
   - White shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20.

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of these shirts have buttons.

4. **Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts = 50.
   - Floral shirts with buttons = 20.
   - Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30.

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 30.
   - Number of white shirts with no collars = 20.
   - Difference = 30 - 20 = 10.

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of goats sold from each farm:

- From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we determine the number of goats remaining in each farm:

- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we start by calculating the total number of pairs he buys in a year. Given that he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we can find the annual total by multiplying the monthly amount by the number of months in a year:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the given discount, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. Calculate the total cost of the green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 baskets of green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75
     \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the red food before the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 54
     \]

3. Apply the discount to the red food:
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

4. Calculate the total cost of the red food after the discount:
   - Subtract the total discount from the original cost of the red food:
     \[
     54 - 6 = 48
     \]

5. Calculate the total cost of all the baskets:
   - Add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food:
     \[
     75 + 48 = 123
     \]

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is one-half of the total 90 rooms:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town will build three times as many homes as in the first year. This means:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Doubling this amount for the third year gives:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]
4. To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes built each year:
   \[
   12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \text{ homes}
   \]

Thus, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- My brother's age is \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother).
- My sister's age is \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister).
- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 13 \]

Thus, I am 13 years old.

2. Determine how many packs of 8 glue sticks are needed to get at least 54 glue sticks:
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs}
   \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs}

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial volume of water passing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the volume doubles, so we calculate the new volume as follows:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons. Therefore, we add this to the volume from the second day:

\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

"To address the problem of exponential growth in the context of the plague, we start with the initial number of infected individuals and apply the growth rate over the specified period.

**Initial Condition:**
- Number of infected people on Day 0: 10

**Growth Rate:**
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, we multiply the number of customers by the amount each tipped:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

Next, add the number of oranges given to her son:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, Jennifer remains with 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

2. Let \( G \) be the number of green cars.
3. Let \( B \) be the number of blue cars.
4. Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow cars.

From the problem, we know:
- The rink has 12 red cars: \( R = 12 \).
- The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars: \( G = R - 2 \).
- The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars: \( B = 3G \).

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of books is 85: \( S + A + F = 85 \).
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

Next, we calculate Keenan's monthly contribution by subtracting Madeline's contribution from the total monthly cost:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly contribution} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the month is four weeks long, we divide Keenan's monthly contribution by 4 to find the weekly amount:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly contribution} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends 40 dollars per week on groceries.

"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we will break down his consumption over the three days step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) pieces.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   - Total eaten by the end of the second day: \( 24 + 10 = 34 \) pieces.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Remaining pieces after the second day: \( 60 - 34 = 26 \) pieces.
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \) pieces.

4. **Total Pieces Eaten:**
   - Total eaten by the end of the third day: \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) pieces.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is \( \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is \( \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Thus, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total cost of the 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has, which is $12.48:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. Given that she earned $33 for 3 hours, we calculate her hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Number of Hours}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

This means Ella earns $11 per hour. To find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

\[ \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Thus, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours.

132"
"To solve this problem, we start by adding the number of marbles Paul initially has to the number of marbles his friend gave him. Paul starts with 52 marbles and receives 28 more from his friend:

52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Next, we need to account for the marbles Paul lost. He lost 1/4 of his total marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total gives us the number of marbles Paul has left:

80 - 20 = 60 marbles

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens he plans to sell to make a profit of $2000. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
   \]

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens:**
   Each chicken is sold for $50.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the chickens:**
   Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Micah and Mitchell combined. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sold by all three is 32 glasses, we can calculate the combined sales of Micah and Mitchell as follows:

32 (total glasses) - 14 (glasses sold by Julie) = 18 (glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined).

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

18 (glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined) / 2 = 9 (glasses sold by each boy).

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

14 (glasses sold by Julie) - 9 (glasses sold by Micah) = 5.

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling her rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new rope Sarah wants to buy. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she will buy 20 meters:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how much money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sarah will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left over."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Let's denote her current age by \( x \).

Given:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

To find \( y \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Money Left in Budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
     \[
     65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we start by calculating the number of microphones that won't fit. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we start by calculating the total number of petals for each type of flower.

First, for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and its speed is given as 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \]

So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig, \( W \), can be calculated as:

\[ W = 5T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ 55 \] meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided. Let \( c \) represent the cost of one carrot. Ellen's daily food expenses include two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars. The total cost of her daily food is $11.

The equation representing her total daily cost is:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 2c = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 1 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use algebra to find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the problem:
- The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- The second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

First, we need to determine the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:
\[ \text{Total times mowing lawns} = J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume that the total payment of $6 is for all 9 times she mowed lawns. Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Next, we know Tasha's total earnings from all activities (lemonade sales and mowing lawns) is $80. We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} + \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 80 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} + 6 = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade sales, we solve for the unknown:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha originally had. According to the problem, Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the distance Anis rowed. Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles and Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed:

\[ \text{Additional distance Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance Anis rowed by adding this additional distance to Dijana's distance:

\[ \text{Total distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed on that day:

\[ \text{Total distance rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use proportional reasoning to determine the amount of material required for the specified number of masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow a straightforward arithmetic process:

1. **Calculate the total number of tickets purchased:**
   - Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies 3 times.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets is \( 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times/movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \).

2. **Determine the total amount spent:**
   - Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets.

3. **Calculate the average price per ticket:**
   - The average price per ticket is the total amount spent divided by the total number of tickets.
   - This can be calculated as \( \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} \).

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Thus, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Adding these up:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles and gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 marbles is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles given away is:
\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \text{ marbles} \]

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial number of marbles:
\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \text{ marbles} \]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age, and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
4. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago.

We can write the equation based on the fourth piece of information:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to set up and solve an equation based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we express the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 3 \times y \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is the sum of the pieces thrown at the red and yellow balloons:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total distance Jon drives in a 30-day month. Given that he drives 100 miles each day, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine how many tune-ups are required based on the car's maintenance schedule. Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Thus, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Thus, the total amount of water used over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, use the value of \( J \) to find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the hay requirements for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps, focusing on the rates and distances involved.

1. **Initial Swimming Distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Time for Initial Swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Rest Time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Time for Remaining Swimming:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To determine the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let \( M \) represent Marcus's age, \( L \) represent Leo's age, and \( D \) represent Deanna's age. We are given the following information:

1. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{L}{2} \)

First, substitute the value of \( D \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 26 - 5 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( M \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To find \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the points scored by Bahati, \( A \) represent the points scored by Azibo, and \( D \) represent the points scored by Dinar.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From the second equation, \( A = B - 20 \).
- From the third equation, \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we first convert the number of cups to a numerical value:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

1. **Determine the initial number of occupied beds:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 2 weeks
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

4. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( J \), by Jason as \( X \), and by Jordan as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \( X = 2J \)
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \( D = 2X \)
3. Jason carried 2 balls: \( X = 2 \)

First, substitute \( X = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( J \):
\[ X = 2J \]
\[ 2 = 2J \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Next, substitute \( X = 2 \) into the second equation to find \( D \):
\[ D = 2X \]
\[ D = 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now, we have the number of balls each person carried:
- Jeffrey: \( J = 1 \)
- Jason: \( X = 2 \)
- Jordan: \( D = 4 \)

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan:

"To determine the cost of the travel tickets, we start by noting that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Given that the supplies cost $400, we calculate the additional cost for the tickets as follows:

\[ 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

Adding this additional cost to the original cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships given in the problem. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

First, we substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, we substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Therefore, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the key pieces of information:

- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- The total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode.

First, we calculate the number of episodes:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ episodes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent watching all the episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

"To calculate the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the ages of each family member based on the information provided:

1. Nani is 8 years old.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, which means:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
   \[
   8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of all three family members:
\[
8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we start by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

Thus, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had, which is 12 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges.

First, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:
  \[
  2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
  \]

Next, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
\]

Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
\]

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:
\[
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
\]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[
6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and using the information given:

Let \( R \) represent the number of cherries Robert has.
Let \( J \) represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
Let \( C \) represent the number of cherries Richard has.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) (Robert has 30 cherries)
2. \( R = C + 10 \) (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)
3. The total number of cherries is 60.

First, we can find the number of cherries Richard has:
\[ R = C + 10 \]
\[ 30 = C + 10 \]
\[ C = 30 - 10 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Next, we use the total number of cherries to find the number of cherries Jerry has:
\[ R + J + C = 60 \]
\[ 30 + J + 20 = 60 \]
\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ R - J = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of item and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find the number of boxes sold each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( E \) be Emil's current age.
- \( D \) be Emil's dad's current age.
- \( B \) be Emil's brother's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
   \[
   E = 19
   \]

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
   \]
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   \[
   D = 43

"To determine how many students are leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students remain after the football players leave:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy and the total cost of these flowers. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we start by calculating the amount she sets aside each month for shoes. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.

First, calculate 25% of $2,000.00:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we calculate the total amount she sets aside in a year:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica sets aside $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve the problem of determining how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

### Peeling the Shrimp
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
  \[
  \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Cooking the Shrimp
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
  \[
  \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
  \[
  \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Total Time
- The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
  \[
  \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we sum the total cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra to find the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( D \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley.
   - Let \( B_1 \) be the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.
   - Let \( B_2 \) be the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the second time.

2. **Given information:**
   - \( D = 30 \) years (Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet).
   - \( B_2 = 3D \) (Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time is three times his dad's age when he saw the comet).

3. **Calculate \( B_2 \):**
   \[
   B_2 = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

5. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the first sighting:**
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, the difference in Bill's age between the two sightings is 75 years.
   \[
   B_2 = B_1 + 75
   \]

6. **Substitute \( B_2 \) into the equation:**
   \[
   90 = B_1 + 75
   \]

7. **Solve for \( B_1 \):**
   \[
   B_1 = 90 - 75 = 15
   \]

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month. Similarly, for 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month. For 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use ratios to find the number of flights to France.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) trips in total.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) flights.
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the howls of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias' and Chikote's howls.
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Total howl duration = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
   - Total howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we start by calculating the total amount of money he received from his parents.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total contribution from his parents is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( A \) be Akbar's age,
- \( L \) be Alessandro's age,
- \( H \) be Helene's age,
- \( W \) be Wilfred's age.

We know:
1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we write the equation for the total age:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values for Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person at the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we start by setting up the problem using ratios and proportions. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is thus divided into 8 parts, each part being \( x \).

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate the ratio of one adult's slice to the total watermelon and then convert it to a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total available time.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Total available time:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours available.

6. **Time left for updating records:**

"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can use algebra to set up and solve an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which translates to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total costs incurred by the studio. The costs include the rental fee for the studio and the fee per student per session.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: 4

First, calculate the total cost per session:
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = \text{Cost to rent the studio} + (\text{Cost per student} \times \text{Number of students}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = 25 + (1.50 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = 25 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = 40 \]

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
\[ \text{Total cost per week} = \text{Total cost per session} \times \text{Number of sessions per week} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per week} = 40 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per week} = 120 \]

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
\[ \text{Total cost per month} = \text{Total cost per week} \times \text{Number of weeks in a month} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per month} = 120 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per month} = 480 \]

Therefore, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the information given:

Let \( p \) represent the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, and \( m \) represent the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can write the following equations:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

Next, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

1. Solve for \( p \):
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

2. Solve for \( m \):
\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of discharge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. Here are the costs:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply the initial price by this growth factor:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

"To determine the total number of selfies and portraits, we start by calculating the number of pictures in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally across 8 albums. 

First, we find the number of pictures per album:
\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of selfies:
- 3 albums are selfies only.
\[ \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of portraits:
- 2 albums are portraits.
\[ \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to get the total:
\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

"To solve this problem, we will carefully track the number of guests at the hotel through each step of the day's activities.

1. **Initial number of guests:** The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Evening check-ins:** 7 more people check in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We are given:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily mining rate for 40 dwarves:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days they can mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and their cost. Given the packages:

1. 2 sandwiches for $3
2. 4 sandwiches for $6

We can determine the cost per sandwich by dividing the total cost by the number of sandwiches in each package:

- For the first package: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars per sandwich
- For the second package: \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars per sandwich

Since the cost per sandwich is consistent at $1.5, we can use this rate to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:

\[ 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

Given:
- The second person received $80 more than the first person, so the second person received \( x + 80 \).
- The third person received twice what the second person received, so the third person received \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Total days = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. **Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:**
   - Number of painters = 4.
   - Hours worked by each painter = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

Thus, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the concept of exponential decay, which is commonly used to model depreciation. The formula for exponential decay is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years (from 2007 to 2010)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra to determine the number of slices each person ate and then find the total number of slices consumed.

Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate. According to the problem:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so \( J + 3 = 10 \).

First, solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we know:
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Silvia ate \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

Next, calculate the total number of slices eaten:
\[ \text{Total slices} = J + (J + 3) + 2J \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 7 + 10 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total waiting time for Paul, we need to determine the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the total time until the fourth train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring produces one jellyfish every second.

First, let's convert the time from hours to seconds:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 14400 seconds:
- Since one spring produces 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, it will produce 14400 jellyfish.

Now, we need to find the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs:
- If one spring produces 14400 jellyfish, then 5 springs will produce 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

Thus, the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:

\[ B = 90 \]

The problem also states that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation:

\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the total distance James walked, then use his walking speed to determine the total time.

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost of buying bananas individually versus buying them in bunches.

First, let's determine the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved:

- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given conditions.

Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 40
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 20
\]

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine the height the bouncy ball reaches on its second bounce, we start by calculating the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Given that each story in the mall is 24 feet high and the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the height the ball reaches after the first bounce. Since the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the height the ball reaches after the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given, using fractions to represent the portions of the triceratops that were eaten at each step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This represents the remaining portion after the T-Rex and the velociraptors had their share. Since the Allosaurus ate the last half of what was left after the velociraptors, the 270 kilograms must be half of what was left after the velociraptors. Therefore, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex is:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the total weight of the triceratops. Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is:
   \[
   1080 \times 2 = 2160 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 2160 kilograms.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To solve the problem of how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to consider the speed of each train and the time they have been traveling.

1. The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Since both trains are traveling in opposite directions, the distance between them increases at the sum of their speeds.

First, calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

Next, add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them:
- Total distance apart: \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use our expertise in fractions and ratios.

We are told that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \). Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{T}{5} \]

Next, we are informed that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Thus, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \]

We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To solve this problem, we start by dividing the total length of the ribbon into 4 equal parts. Given that the total length is 100 centimeters, each of the 4 parts will be:

\[
\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
\]

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 cm parts into 5 equal parts. Therefore, the length of each of these smaller parts will be:

\[
\frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
\]

Thus, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and this 40% is equal to 240 boys. 

First, we calculate the total number of students in the school. If 40% of the total population is 240, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Population} = 240 \]

To find the total population, we solve for the Total Population:

\[ \text{Total Population} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Population} - \text{Number of Boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the shares of apples that Pierre and Paul will take and then find out how much is left for Jacques.

First, let's calculate Pierre's share:
- Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples.
- A quarter is represented by the fraction \(\frac{1}{4}\).
- Therefore, Pierre's share is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, let's calculate Paul's share:
- Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples.
- A third is represented by the fraction \(\frac{1}{3}\).
- Therefore, Paul's share is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
  \]

Now, we add the shares of Pierre and Paul to find out how much they have taken together:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the original 12 kg to find out how much Jacques will have left:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

First, let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Here, \( x \) is the number of minutes it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
255 \times x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 255 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time each person spent on their chores and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

   - Total production by the next two workers: \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

3. **Calculate the total production by the four workers:**
   - Total production by the four workers: \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

4. **Determine the total number of toys needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift: \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

5. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Total production by the four workers: 200 toys.
   - Total production by all five workers: 380 toys.
   - Production by the fifth worker: \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

6. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
4. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had a total of \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
5. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

Given that Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we know:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite the total equation as:
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

We also have the equation for Camden and Sarah:
\[ C + S = 30 \]

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable tree:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2. Thus, the total revenue from selling all the planks is:

   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total amount Jane has already saved. She saves $4 each week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This can be calculated as:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by translating the given information into an algebraic equation. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) represents the number of marbles Bob currently has. To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can use the principle of weighted averages. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T_2 \).

Given:
- The temperature of the water in the first mug, \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug.
- The final temperature of the mixed water, \( T_f \), must be at least 40 degrees.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot T_1) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{5} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in both cows and chickens over the 21 days and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

4. **Total number of cows after three weeks**:
   50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows

5. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
6. **Chickens added per day**: 10
7. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks**:
   20 initial chickens + 210 added chickens = 230 chickens

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ discount} = 0.10 \]
\[ 90\% \text{ of the total cost} = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 \]
\[ 0.90 \times \$40.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by translating the given information into algebraic expressions.

First, we determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. This can be expressed as:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem provides the ratio of potatoes to scoops: it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be broken down as:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

We can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) eggs.

2. Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs.

3. Add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:
   - Total eggs = \(90 + 150 = 240\) eggs.

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - The total number of dozens is \(240 \div 12 = 20\) dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the quantities given and the relationships between them.

1. There are 17 green jellybeans.
2. There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.

Next, we need to find the number of blue jellybeans. We do this by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans})
\]
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of men to women on the bus, which is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers is 84.

First, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

Next, we find the value of one part by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday over 3 days, considering both individual sunflowers and those sold in bouquets.

First, let's break down the daily sales:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
  \[
  \frac{26}{2} = 13
  \]

- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is:
  \[
  \frac{56}{8} = 7
  \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is:
\[
7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
\[
13 + 84 = 97
\]

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:
\[
97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of seashells each person collected and then find out how many each person gets after dividing them equally.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- \( J \) as the number of seashells Jim collected.
- \( R \) as the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells: \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos: \( J = C + 5 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey: \( C = 2R \).

First, we substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, we substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we know:
- Jim collected 27 seashells.
- Carlos collected 22 seashells.
- Carrey collected 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells collected is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of face masks Tyrion uses over a 2-day period, given his mask-changing habits.

1. Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times each time he goes out.
2. He goes out 3 times a day.
3. Therefore, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/out} \times 3 \text{ outs/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]
4. To find the total number of face masks used over 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:

"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Cole hid. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we have:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs found by each participant:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is:
  \[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which is:
  \[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is:
  \[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we sum the eggs found by all participants:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find the number of eggs still hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow a series of arithmetic steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, the first two complexes have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes.
   - 60% of 400 apartments is \(400 \times 0.60 = 240\) apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:**
   - The total number of apartments is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Therefore, his total earnings per week are \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\) dollars.

So, John makes:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the ropes and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote:
- The length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters.
- The length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the combined length equation:
- From \( R = 4B \), we have \( R \).
- From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can solve for \( Y \) as \( Y = B + 7 \).

Now, substitute these into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B = 5 \), we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie is given $5, and Rissa is given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount of money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we start by understanding the distribution of the paint colors. The mural is composed of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. Half of the mural is yellow, and the remaining half is equally divided among the red, white, and purple paints.

1. First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
   \[
   \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. Next, determine the total amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple colors:
   \[
   \text{Total paint for red, white, and purple} = 12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:
   \[
   \text{Red paint} = \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then sum these areas.

1. **Area of the bedrooms:**
   Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms:
   \[
   \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Area of the living room:**
   The living room is 5 times the area of one bedroom.
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Area of the rest of the house:**
   The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1, given that 1 pod is used per cycle.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and use arithmetic and ratios effectively.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

"To address the problem, let's break it down step by step, focusing on the percentages and arithmetic involved.

1. **Initial Chalk Length and Usage on Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Daily Usage and Remaining Chalk:**
   - From Tuesday onwards, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means that each day, 80% of the remaining chalk is left.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Chalk for Each Subsequent Day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling:**
   - After 1 day (Tuesday), the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days (Wednesday), the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's carefully track the number of apples Newton has at each step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fall out of the tree.
2. Newton picks up both apples. He puts one in his pocket and throws the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first apple he picked up) + 5 (from the thrown apple) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picks up these 6 apples, puts all but one in his pocket, and throws the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the thrown apple) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picks up all 7 apples and puts them in his pocket.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza that Kate's friends will consume and then determine how many whole pizzas are required.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices.

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(\frac{36}{12} = 3\) pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) pizzas.

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
- Total number of pizzas = 3 (cheese) + 3 (pepperoni) = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy \(\boxed{6}\) pizzas."

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - The net number of snowballs Jay can make in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to express the relationship between John's and Jim's ages.

Let's denote:
- \( J \) as Jim's age 20 years ago.
- John's age 20 years ago as \( 2J \) (since John was twice as old as Jim).

Given that John is currently 28 years old, we can determine his age 20 years ago:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \]

So, 20 years ago, John was 8 years old. According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim at that time:
\[ 2J = 8 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and work backwards from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
19"

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then sum them up.

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice the number of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]
   Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

3. The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red and black pens:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the total amount John spends on both the scotch and the cognac:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\).
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**

"To solve the problem, we start by translating the given statement into an algebraic equation. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40"" can be written as:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Here, \( x \) represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we start by calculating the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day, and Jordan has 2 children. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Next, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 per day and Jordan's wife changes 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of red jelly beans in the jar and compare it to the actual number of red jelly beans, which is given as 900.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Account for packing efficiency:**
   The jelly beans are packed with an efficiency of 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by the jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}

5. **Calculate the difference between the estimated and actual number of red jelly beans:**
   The actual number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

"To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning required for 80 meatballs. We'll break this down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of pounds of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - To find out how many pounds are needed for 80 meatballs, we use the proportion:
     \[
     \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef.
   - For 5 pounds of ground beef, the total amount of seasoning required is:
     \[
     \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

   - The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
   - The total cost without the discount is:
     \[
     35 + 40 = 75
     \]
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:
     \[
     75 \times 0.20 = 15
     \]
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     75 - 15 = 60
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the nail art:**
   - Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers.
   - The cost per nail is $3.
   - The total cost for the nail art is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given:

Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.
Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can express the number of paintings Shelley has as \( K + 8 \).
Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for Samantha's paintings as:
\[ 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( K \):

1. Simplify the equation:
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]

2. Add 4 to both sides to isolate \( K \):
\[ 27 + 4 = K \]
\[ 31 = K \]

Thus, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To determine the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find 80% of $40, we calculate \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - Adding this increase to the original price, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find 50% of $72, we calculate \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that 9 novels represent 3 quarters of that total.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels this year, we need to isolate the variable. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
2. Determine the total number of eggs.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs.**

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be expressed as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine the total time it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the land segment and the water segment.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)
3. **Distance in Water**: \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)

Next, we calculate the time for each segment:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both segments to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels.

Adding all these together gives the total number of pieces of popcorn:

"To determine how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the total cost of the trays she bought.

1. Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes:
   - Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
   - Total earnings from cupcakes = 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40.

2. Calculate the total earnings from cookies:
   - Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
   - Total earnings from cookies = 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40.

3. Calculate the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from cupcakes + Earnings from cookies
   - Total earnings = $40 + $40 = $80.

4. Calculate the total cost of the trays:
   - Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
   - Total cost of trays = 5 trays * $4/tray = $20.

5. Calculate the money left after buying the trays:
   - Money left = Total earnings - Total cost of trays
   - Money left = $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left is $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of seeds in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the number of seeds in a small sunflower is:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a series of algebraic equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackie's height before the summer.
2. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is \( J + 3 \).
3. Anne is 2 inches taller than Jackie's current height, so Anne's height is \( (J + 3) + 2 = J + 5 \).
4. Anne is twice the height of Albert, and Albert's height is 36 inches. Therefore, Anne's height is \( 2 \times 36 = 72 \) inches.

Now, we can set up the equation for Anne's height:
\[ J + 5 = 72 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J + 5 = 72 \]
\[ J = 72 - 5 \]
\[ J = 67 \]

Thus, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra to break down the information and find the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
- Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, let's determine the distance Aaron ran:
- Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

Next, let's find Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, let's determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Finally, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

   - Let \( J \) be James's current age.
   - Therefore, \( J = 2D \).
   - Substituting \( D = 9 \):
     \[
     J = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]
   - James is currently 18 years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Let \( J_{\text{John}} \) be John's current age.
   - Therefore, \( J_{\text{John}} = 19 + J \).
   - Substituting \( J = 18 \):
     \[
     J_{\text{John}} = 19 + 18 = 37
     \]
   - John is currently 37 years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Let \( Y \) be the current age of John's youngest son.
   - Therefore, \( Y = J_{\text{John}} - 32 \).
   - Substituting \( J_{\text{John}} = 37 \):
     \[
     Y = 37 - 32 = 5
     \]
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \( Y + 3 \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 5 \):
     \[
     Y + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8
     \]

The age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among the 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
