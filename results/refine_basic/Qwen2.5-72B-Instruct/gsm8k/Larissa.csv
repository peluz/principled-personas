"To figure out the total number of bolts needed for a robe, let's break it down:

- A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It also requires half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber, which means it needs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \text{ bolts in total} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total investment.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. So, the total investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down:

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find out how many meters he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can group them into pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass ($5) and one discounted glass ($3).
- The total cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

Kylar is buying 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the distance John travels away from home:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back home during the 4 hours:
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, add the distances he traveled back home:
- Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Finally, subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - For 40 hours, her earnings are: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - For 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by defining the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you with your question about Claire and her egg consumption.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. To find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks, let's break it down:

1. Claire uses 3 eggs each day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.
3. Over 28 days, Claire will use 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 84 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To figure out the speed I need to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, I'll start by calculating the total time I should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

Rearranging the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

I have already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time I have to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance I need to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed I need to walk the remaining distance, I use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, I need to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we start by determining how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Post-it Notes Remaining**: After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
   - Cost per red tie = 40 + 0.5 * 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = 600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on ties = 200 + 600 = 800

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - There are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Number of girls = 60.
   - Number of boys = 2 * 60 = 120.

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls.
   - Total number of students = 120 + 60 = 180.

3. **Find the number of teachers:**
   - There are 5 students for every teacher.
   - Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5.
   - Number of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36.

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
- So, for 180 days, the puppy will need:
  \[
  180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days of the year:
- The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day.
- So, for 185 days, the puppy will need:
  \[
  185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
  \]

Now, let's add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required, given that each bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
\]

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining how much laundry David does. We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

1. **Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50:**
   - Each package contains 3 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
   - The total cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Buying in packages of 2 for $1:**
   - Each package contains 2 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
   - The total cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

By comparing the two costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.

The savings by choosing the better price (packages of 2) is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"To solve this, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( W \) be the number of games won and \( L \) be the number of games lost. We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can express the number of copies Marilyn's record sold as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the dinosaur picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amounts of potato salad for adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then calculate the volume. 

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV time he spent from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

First, let's set up the equation to find Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we can calculate her new salary as follows:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.
- The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.
- The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Total incomplete questions = \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs, and \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Finally, find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. Over a week (7 days), this amounts to:
   \[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

2. Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked these 14 hours, his earnings would be:
   \[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, let's break it down:

1. John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
2. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
   \[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

3. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

4. To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:
- Difference in time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To figure out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles that came by.

First, let's calculate the number of tires for each type of vehicle:
- Bicycles: 5 people each with 2 tires, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles: 3 people each with 3 tires, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- Unicycle: 1 person with 1 tire, so \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's solve this step by step, starting with the information given:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry.
6. Five fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( x \).

1. After Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. After the seagull ate 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. After the three pigeons ate 9 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. After the ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

\[
x = 48

"To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To solve this, I'll first convert all the lengths to feet and then add them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total monthly requirement is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double this amount:

"To figure out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, let's break down the distances each person covers.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means each increase is a multiplication by 1.20 (since 20% is 0.20, and 1 + 0.20 = 1.20).
3. **Number of Increases**: Over 36 months, the price increases every 2 months. Therefore, the number of increases is 36 / 2 = 18.
4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
   Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be Seth's current age and \( B \) be Brooke's current age.
2. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:

"To figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment for all her debts:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"Sure, let's calculate the total time Billy will need to prep the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

First, we need to determine the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:

   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total number of pens Janet has now.

1. **Green pens**: Janet originally had 22 green pens.
2. **Yellow pens**: Janet originally had 10 yellow pens.
3. **Blue pens**: Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens is \(6 \times 9 = 54\).
4. **Red pens**: Janet bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

Adding all the pens together:
\[ 22 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (yellow)} + 54 \text{ (blue)} + 12 \text{ (red)} = 98 \]

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores.
3. Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests.
4. Calculate the score needed on the sixth test.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:
- Sum of the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Now, we determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:
- Average of 93 with five tests: \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \)

Finally, we calculate the score needed on the sixth test:
- Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
- The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
- Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \)
- Solving for \( x \): \( x = 465 - 367 = 98 \)

Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total.

First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode during the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode during the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distances from both periods:
- Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40g = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20g = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To find the cost of each cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   Each plate costs $6000.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   \[
   \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   \[
   20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To figure out how many times I need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, I'll start by calculating the total cost of the items I want to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since I want 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

I already have $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount I need is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

I earn $5 each time I babysit. I babysit 4 times, so my total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding my babysitting earnings to my savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

I still need:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

I earn $4 each time I mow the lawn. To find out how many times I need to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, I divide the remaining amount by my earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, I must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this chicken egg problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we have:
1. \( W = R + 2 \) (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
2. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the second equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To find out how many customers entered the store on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, 100 customers entered the store.
2. On the second day, 50 more customers entered than on the first day, which means 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Now, let's calculate the number of customers on the third day:

Total customers over three days = Customers on the first day + Customers on the second day + Customers on the third day
500 = 100 + 150 + Customers on the third day

Solving for the customers on the third day:
500 = 250 + Customers on the third day
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
Customers on the third day = 250

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we first need to calculate the total amount she has to pay back, including the 10% interest on the $2000 she borrowed.

The interest is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:

- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of students in the school hall is 1000.
2. 30% of the students leave through exit A:
   \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \) students.
3. The number of students remaining after some leave through exit A:
   \( 1000 - 300 = 700 \) students.
4. 3/5 of the remaining students leave through exit B:
   \( 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \) students.
5. The number of students remaining after some leave through exit B:
   \( 700 - 420 = 280 \) students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can determine Robert's candies by dividing John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - So, the number of pen pals he still has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters he receives each week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of pages he needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time he spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To figure out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Calls with the Boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra Calls to Other People:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total Minutes Used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes Remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information:

- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

"Sure, let's break it down:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to apply the makeup.
- The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to complete.

First, calculate the total hours of work:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount:
\[ 30,000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30,000 \text{ dollars} - 3,000 \text{ dollars} = 27,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall will have:
\[ 20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Number of windows in the bedrooms of one house: \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

2. Each house also has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Total number of windows in one house: \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. John has 2 houses, so we need to double the number of windows in one house.
   - Total number of windows in both houses: \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To solve this, let's break down the total number of stitches used for the different parts of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \(900 \div 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.

Adding these up, the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette are:
\[900 + 90 + 180 = 1170\]

The entire sweater project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[1800 - 1170 = 630\]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[630 \div 2 = 315\]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. Each of them will be 10 years older, so we add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco:

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we can determine the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To figure out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, who each consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal and eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 people in the household.
   - They eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   So, the total rice consumption per meal for the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

   Since they eat two meals a day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   So, the total rice consumption per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}

"To figure out how much John pays a year for his driving service, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - The driving service charges $2 per mile, so the cost for 15,000 miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total cost for the miles driven is $30,000.
   - The total bonus is $1,800.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"To figure out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, determine how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods are required for her to lose 8 pounds:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Theo can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

First, let's break down Theo's expenses:

1. **Business Suits**: 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   \[
   700 + (5 \times 100) = 700 + 500 = 1200
   \]

Now, let's add up all these expenses:
\[
600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
\]

Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip. So, the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
\[
6000 - 2000 = 4000
\]

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
\[
4000 - 1950 = 2050

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cera's Current Age:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is 105, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To figure out how many people show up for my Christmas party, I need to do a bit of math. Here's the breakdown:

- I invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- I also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

However, some people couldn't make it:
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of that number had previous commitments, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people.

Adding those who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments gives us \(8 + 2 = 10\) people who couldn't attend.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for my party is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run by 1/5, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000"

Next, we know the number of apples picked on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Tuesday} = 12 \]

For Wednesday, the number of apples picked is double that of Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we sum the apples picked over the three days:
\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan is for 5 months. First, convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
   \]

   Now, calculate the total interest for 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} \approx 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of pesos:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, this means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Then, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

2. The performance is with just the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

3. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

4. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them.
   - Total number of people who sang in the performance = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
   - Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16."

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can add up the steps he had already taken and the steps he had left to reach his goal, then subtract this total from his daily goal.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000

Total steps taken before the jog + steps taken during the jog + steps left after the jog = 10,000
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000

Solving for the steps during the jog:
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during jog = 10,000
steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000

   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport:**
   - Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.
   - It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
   - Time available to read = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Determine how early Toby will be:**
   - Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes.
   - Time left after reading = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"
"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ 3.00 \]

"To figure out how much Tim spent in total, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it's \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After applying the discount, the cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total, the final amount Tim spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
   where \( C \) is the number of camels and \( D \) is the number of dromedaries.

2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

"To figure out how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hot dog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hot dogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.
   - The total number of hot dogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

   - Bernadette's drive is four times as long as Wayne's.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - So, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive takes 4 minutes).

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = 1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = 3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

   - James takes 5 minutes longer:
   \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Run:**
   - Let \( R \) be the time it took James to run.
   - Jon's total time: 170 minutes
   - James' total time: \( 36 + 85 + R \)
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so:
   \[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + R = 180 \]
   \[ R = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:

2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

First, let's calculate the volume of one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total volume of soil needed for 10 raised beds:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we need to determine the number of bags required:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem step by step.

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in my class, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students in the grade level. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
\]

To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the overlaps between the allergies. 

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Total: 9 + 6 = 15

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they have been counted twice. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
- Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total kids in the class: 32
- Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, so 2 packs contain:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of animals:

- Total animals combined: \(40 + 80 = 120\)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of onions Sophia bought.
- \( y \) as the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for. 

First, let's determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit:
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days
- Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, find the cost of the house:

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars, with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To figure out how many letters Elise has written, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the full alphabet twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, writing it twice means:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   \(13\) letters.

3. Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written:
   \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

4. Rewriting all 65 letters again means:
   \(65\) letters.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
   \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's figure out how old his nephew is today.

First, let's set up the equation. If Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years he will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

Let's denote the nephew's current age as \( N \). In 7 years, the nephew will be:
\[ N + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To figure out the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to understand the percentage by which her oven is off. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

First, let's calculate the percentage increase:
- The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage increase is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set for a desired actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we first need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate it as follows:

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house value:
   \[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
   \[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
   \[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many cups and dishes Judy brought to the church's charity event. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so:

\[ \text{Number of dishes} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups and dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy:

\[ \text{Number of dishes brought by her friend} = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy's total utensils:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils} \]

Her friend's total utensils:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:
\[ 36 + 84 = 120 \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:

"To figure out how much water I need to drink, I first calculate the total calories burned from both activities.

For the aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For the running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Adding these together gives the total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since I need to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, I calculate the total water needed as follows:
1600 calories * (100 ml / 200 calories) = 800 ml

So, I need to drink 800 ml of water.

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there's a large jar filled with red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We need to find out how many more green jelly beans there are compared to red jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams.

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up an equation based on the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as \( J \).

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, so:

\[ \text{Pounds per hour for Ruiz} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours:

\[ \text{Pounds per hour for Marissa} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ \text{Total pounds for Ruiz} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ \text{Total pounds for Marissa} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

"To figure out the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we first need to understand how many washes she can get from the bottle. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how much money Joe will have left after his shopping trip.

Joe has $50 to spend. The shirt he wants costs $25, and the shorts cost $35. The store is offering a 30% discount on everything. Let's calculate the total cost of the items after the discount.

First, we find the total cost of the items before the discount:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the original price. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost after the discount from the $50 Joe has:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after his purchase.

"To figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - Gary does laundry twice a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, the total number of loads per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
     \]

2. **Determine the total amount of water used:**
   - Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
   - Therefore, the total amount of water used in a year is:
     \[
     104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water:**
   - The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon.
   - So, the total cost for the water used in a year is:
     \[
     2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the difference in their speeds and the distance between them. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10. 

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:

- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
- Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
- Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To figure out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to break down the digging into two parts: the soil and the clay.

1. **Soil Digging:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through the soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Clay Digging:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through the clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through the soil + Time to dig through the clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To figure out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the total number of people and the number of cupcakes each person will get. 

1. **Count the total number of people:**
   - Howie
   - His teacher
   - 25 classmates

   Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

2. **Determine the number of cupcakes per person:**
   - Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate).

3. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes:**
   - Total cupcakes = Number of people × Cupcakes per person
   - Total cupcakes = 27 people × 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. After 1 week, I received 2000 likes on my selfie.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is:
   \[ 2000 \times 70 = 140000 \]
3. Recently, I received 20000 more new likes. Adding these to the number of likes after three weeks gives:
   \[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

With a $2 voucher, the final amount Clara paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

On Wednesday, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Thus, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - This amount is half of what she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats are \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \).

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \).

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \).

4. **Sum the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
   - Total sales for both months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \).

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs I need for the party, I'll start by calculating the total number of deviled egg halves required. Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, I need to find out how many whole eggs are required:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, I will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To figure out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish reading the 200-page book, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the book at his planned pace of 10 pages per day.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we subtract the number of days it will take Mike to finish reading from the total number of days available:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly hanger rental is $5,000.
3. The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'll help you figure out how many toys James needs for the dog shelter.

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs join the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs. After buying these toys, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. This means he needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs. When he returns, he finds that 3 dogs have left the shelter, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs. Since he already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's start by setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it will take:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it will take:

"To figure out how much time John and Jack have left to get to school, we need to add the time they've already spent walking and then subtract that from their total time.

First, let's add the time it took them to get to the library and the fire station:
6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time they've already spent from their total time to walk to school:
30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent) = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's solve this step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and the combined ages of all five children total 44 years.

Let's denote:
- The age of one twin as \( T \)
- The age of one triplet as \( R \)

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \)
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how much time John has to nap. Let's break it down:

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. That's a total of:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

He has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is:
3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

So, the time John has left for napping after finishing his homework is:
180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost for the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total number of months in ten years.

First, let's determine Neil's monthly savings. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 

To find out how many more coins Neil saves each month:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
5760"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - Amount left: \( 125 - 100 = 25 \) dollars.

So, John leaves with 25 dollars."
"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To figure out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
   \]

   Total chairs currently available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs currently available = 48

   Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs currently available

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

So, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

"To figure out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to break down the problem into a few steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks the city will set off:
- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.
- So, the total number of fireworks the city will set off is \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks.

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her house:
- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- So, the number of fireworks she can see from the city's display is \( 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \) fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah has 3 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.
- So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

Finally, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300, assuming they raise an equal amount each hour.

First, let's find out how much they raise per hour:
- In the first 3 hours, they raised $2100.
- Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:
  \[
  \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
  \]

Next, we need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise:
- The total goal is $6300.
- They have already raised $2100.
- The remaining amount needed is:
  \[
  6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

"To figure out how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound of blueberries at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. The original price of each computer was $700.

First, find 10% of $700:
\[ 10\% \times 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs: \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine how long it takes each of them to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog, on the other hand, can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. So, the dog's time is:

\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time by adding the cat's time and the dog's time and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To figure out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, I'll add up the blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, I'll use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100

2. Next, determine the number of votes candidate B received:
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Finally, calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are required if the activity needs 12 groups instead of the initial 6 groups.

1. First, we find the number of students in each of the initial 6 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. Since the total number of students remains the same (54 students), we need to determine how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups.

3. The number of additional groups needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Here's what happens:

1. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

3. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

4. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

6. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Small Buttons (Final Count):**
   - Total small buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \) small buttons.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \).

According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which equals the total number of people on the council:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting \( F = 2A \) into the equation \( F + A = 33 \):
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the first house needs half the number of cases as the second house. Therefore, the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house. Therefore, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.
4. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2x + 2x = 250
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   5x = 250

"To figure out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, let's break it down:

- For 5 days, they ride their bikes 3 times each day.
  - So, for these 5 days: 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

- For the other 2 days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days.
  - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
  - So, for these 2 days: 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

- Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:
  - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"Sure, let's break it down:

- The bag initially has 35 marshmallows.
- John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- They drop 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, we calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, we subtract this from the total number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To figure out how much money Jack and his friends used, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce salt scrub.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars Joe has left is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

So, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food and dog food that Kimberly bought, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
- Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know the total number of Magic Cards is 341. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total number of eggs Cindy collected during the Easter Egg Hunt.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"To figure out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each segment of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance for the initial 4 hours of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance for the 6 hours after his rest:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the two distances to get the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To figure out how much money I have in my purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in my old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- I earned $150 from my part-time job.
- My mom gave me $80.
- I still need $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money I have in my purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money I have is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, I have $120 in my purse.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
  \[
  \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
  \]
- Total number of dishes:
  \[
  \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
  \]

Finally, the total number of socks and dishes together is:
\[
\text{Total} = 90 + 90 = 180

"In Miss Susan's class, there are 20 students. Out of these, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. The rest of the students, which means 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 students, are good at both math and English. To find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects: 5 + 7 = 12.

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, I'll start by calculating the total time available for performances, excluding the intermission. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 110 minutes left for the performances.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group. 

To find out how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes, I divide 110 by 10:

\[ 110 \div 10 = 11 \]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest investment, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \).
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 300 \left(1 + 0.75 \times 3\right) \]
\[ A = 300 \left(1 + 2.25\right) \]
\[ A = 300 \times 3.25 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of:

\[
\boxed{975}

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.
2. He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
   \[
   55 - 10 = 45
   \]
3. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats}
   \]
4. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
   \[
   45 - 20 = 25
   \]
5. To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since we are cleaning one-half of the 90 rooms:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. If it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}

"Let's solve this step by step. 

1. Let's denote my age as \( x \).
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the information given:
- \( S = A + 25 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

We also know that the total number of books is 85:
- \( S + A + F = 85 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
- \( S = (F - 12) + 25 \)
- \( S = F + 13 \)

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:
- \( (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \)
- \( F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \)
- \( 3F + 1 = 85 \)

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many glasses of lemonade the boys sold in total. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses. Julie sold 14 glasses, so the boys together sold:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Sure, let's break it down:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount she gets from selling the rope is:
   \[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

2. Sarah then uses this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. The cost of the new rope is:
   \[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

3. The amount of money Sarah has left after buying the new rope is:
   \[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, Sarah will have \$10 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve the problem, let's start by figuring out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to determine in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of Kelly's grocery items:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Since she has 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
- There is a 15-minute encore at the end.
- The total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert duration can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number he started with.

First, let's add up the toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:
200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add these up:
- Total chimichangas = 125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday)
- Total chimichangas = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many microphones won't fit into pairs. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't find a space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Each pair consists of 2 microphones, so the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Total petals on orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

2. Calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each daisy has 10 petals.
   - Total petals on daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

3. Find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
   - Difference = Total petals on daisies - Total petals on orchids
   - Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a whirligig, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Mark makes a week after his pay raise.

First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage:
- His original hourly wage was $10.
- He received a raise of $2 per hour.
- So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:
- He works 8 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- Therefore, he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.

Now, let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings:
- His new hourly wage is $12.
- He works 40 hours a week.
- So, his weekly earnings are $12 * 40 = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and assuming the payment is for all the times she mowed his lawn, \( J \) must be 1 (since the problem doesn't specify a rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

Now, we can calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:
- Joe's lawn: \( J = 1 \) time
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J = 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times

Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed lawns, and she mowed lawns 9 times, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales:
- Total earnings = $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns = $6
- Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To figure out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, let's break it down:

1. **Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, she will need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, she will need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Lollipops Sold:**
   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Total Revenue:**
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how many pets Larry has. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}

"To solve this, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

First, the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, the difference in distance:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To find out how much commission I will earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, I need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, for the New York Times:
- Each copy costs $5.
- I earn a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- I earn an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

So, the total commission I will earn is:
15.00"
"To find Leo's age, let's start by figuring out Marcus's age. We know that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. 

So, Marcus's age is:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo’s age by doubling Marcus's age:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the information:
- \( B + A + D = 45 \)
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( A = B - 20 \)
- \( D = B - 10 \)

Substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
- \( A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \)
- \( D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \)

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To figure out how many minutes I slept on my bed that day, I need to consider the total time I usually sleep and subtract the time I was sleepwalking and the time I woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - I usually go to sleep at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - I was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time I woke up early:**
   - I woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so I woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

So, the number of minutes I slept on my bed that day is 452.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract these 6 spoons from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

34"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 2 weeks
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

4. **Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we start by determining Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we calculate his age as:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We are given:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, I'll calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, I'll calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how many beads Adrianne has collected for her bracelets.

Adrianne received:
- 20 metallic beads from her mother.
- 10 more beads than her mother gave from her sister, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Twice as many beads as her mother gave from her friend, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add these amounts together:
20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"On Thursday, I caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, I caught 4 times that amount, which is 12 pounds. On Saturday, I caught half of what I caught on Friday, which is 6 pounds. 

To find the total amount of crawfish I caught over the three days, I add the amounts from each day:
3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, I divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

This leaves us with 30 - 6 = 24 students who are not football players.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders or band members together, we get the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Sophie's boot size is 5.
2. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots, so Charlie's boot size is:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]
3. To find the average size of the boots worn by both, we add their boot sizes and divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

The average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

\(\boxed{162}\)"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we start by calculating how many pretzels he eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we have:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find the total for a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"To figure out how much Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"Sure, let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the remaining soil.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you out with your question.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Let's calculate how much that is:

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. Over a year, she will save:

$500.00 * 12 months = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To figure out how long it will take me to peel and cook 90 shrimp, I need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, for peeling:
- I can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, I divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, for cooking:
- I can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To cook 90 shrimp, I need to cook 3 batches of 30 shrimp each:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
  \]
- Each batch takes 10 minutes, so for 3 batches:
  \[
  3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Adding the time for peeling and cooking:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take me 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information:

1. Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill.
2. He also writes 1 check per month for the gas bill.
3. He writes 2 checks per month to the church.
4. He writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month × 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter × 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Adding these together:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights go to Greece.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the remaining flights are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), and each destination (France and Germany) gets half of this, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 8 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After the First 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To figure out how many weeks I need to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, I'll break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000, and I want to save 20% of this amount.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

2. **Determine my total earnings per hour:**
   - I make $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   - Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25

3. **Calculate my total earnings per week:**
   - I work 40 hours a week.
   - Total earnings per week = $25 * 40 = $1,000

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   - Number of weeks = Down payment / Total earnings per week = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2

So, I will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy. Let's break it down:

- **Peaches**: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- **Pears**: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- **Kiwis**: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- **Apples**: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, let's break down the information:

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
2. She distributed these pictures equally into 8 albums.
3. Each album therefore contains 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.
4. 3 albums were selfies only, so the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.
5. 2 albums were portraits, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

Adding the selfies and portraits together, we get 27 + 18 = 45.

"To figure out how long James spends reading, we need to determine his reading speed and then use it to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This means his reading speed is:
\[ \text{Reading speed} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading speed}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The hotel initially has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests check out early, so the number of guests becomes \(100 - 24 = 76\).
3. 15 guests check out late, so the number of guests becomes \(76 - 15 = 61\).
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests check in, so the number of guests becomes \(61 + 30 = 91\).
5. 7 more people check in after dinner, so the number of guests becomes \(91 + 7 = 98\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She then gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. Let's figure out how much money she has left from her earnings.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies:
- 80 cookies * $1 per cookie = $80

Next, the total earnings from the cupcakes:
- 60 cupcakes * $4 per cupcake = $240

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
- $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
- 2 sisters * $10 per sister = $20

Finally, let's subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
- $320 (total earnings) - $20 (given to sisters) = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily mining rate for 40 dwarves:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total monthly mining rate:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days, they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"Let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each. To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to do a bit of math.

1. First, let's calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - With 3 cats, the total food per feeding is 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Next, let's calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

3. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - The first and second monkeys together eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

5. **Total consumption of the third monkey for the week:**
   - The total number of bananas is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas: \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

6. **Daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats \(147 \div 7 = 21\) bananas each day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - A dozen (12) roses cost $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses plus 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses at $2 each is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so the total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the total cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To figure out how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule of the trains:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"To figure out how long it took James to reach the store, let's break down his journey:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since the store is 4 miles away from his home).
2. He realizes he forgot something and walks back home, adding another 2 miles to his journey.
3. After returning home, he walks the full 4 miles to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is:
2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the costs.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up the following equations to find out how much fence Sam gets:

Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) be the amount of fence Harry gets. According to the problem:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Substituting the second equation into the first:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'll help you figure out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, let's break down the sales:
- Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.
- Half of them were Trekking bikes, so:
  \[
  \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes}
  \]
- 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so:
  \[
  0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes}
  \]
- The rest were MTB bikes, so:
  \[
  300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- The price of an MTB is $500.
- The price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, so:
  \[
  \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes:
  \[
  105 \times 500 = 52,500 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Earnings from BMX bikes:
  \[
  45 \times 250 = 11,250 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Earnings from Trekking bikes:
  \[
  150 \times 450 = 67,500 \text{ dollars}

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

To figure out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to consider both the rate at which the farmer is making bales and the rate at which the truck is picking them up.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales made is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
   \]

2. The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales picked up is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
   \]

3. To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made:
   \[
   30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}
   \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week:**
   - John has 6 periods a day and 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods a day.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.
   - Total periods per week: \( 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \).

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class each week:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes per week: \( 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \).

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday.
   - Extra learning time per day: \( \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \).
   - Total extra learning time for the weekend: \( 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total minutes spent learning each week: \( 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \).

5. **Convert the total minutes to hours:**
   - Total hours per week: \( \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \).

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Drop Height:**
   - Each story in the mall is 24 feet high.
   - The ball is dropped from the third floor, so the initial height is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) feet.

2. **First Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - After the first bounce, the height is \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Second Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce.
   - After the second bounce, the height is \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required, and finally, the total cost.

1. **Calculate the area of the walls:**
   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
     - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
     - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area of all four walls = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

2. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( T \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T}{15} = 6
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   T = 6 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   T = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
- Total eggs for the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

For the next 30 days:
- Chester increases his intake to 5 eggs per day.
- Total eggs for the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
- Total dozens of eggs: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

1. **Determine Rissa's initial amount of money:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie.
   - Therefore, Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for the amount given to their little sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money.
   - Therefore, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - Set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5.
   - After giving $3 to their little sister, Ronnie is left with:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mural is half yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

2. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, the total amount of paint for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how long it will take for me to have 60 snowballs, I need to consider both the rate at which I can make snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - I can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, I divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)

"To calculate the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, let's break it down step by step.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Second Day:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total for the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 50 + 90 = 140 \]

"To figure out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total distance all four dogs need to walk together. Since the average distance each dog needs to walk is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs, the total distance is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the distances the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

So, the total distance for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find out how much water the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy costs $40.
2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increases by 80%. 
   - 80% of $40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - So, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).
3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price then decreases by 50%.
   - 50% of $72 is \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after the discount in January is $36.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cleaning time needed:**
   - Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

2. **Determine the total available working time:**
   - The custodian works 8 hours a day.
   - 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
   - Over 5 days, the total available working time = 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes.

3. **Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day:**
   - Total cleaning time = 1200 minutes.
   - Number of days = 5.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

4. **Convert the average time spent cleaning per day into a percentage of the total working day:**
   - Total working time per day = 480 minutes.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes.
   - Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, let's break down the capacity of each bookcase first:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Adding these together, the total number of books one bookcase can hold is:
\[20 + 20 + 15 = 55\] books.

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought:
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, determine the total number of eggs:
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs
- 5 dozens = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, calculate how much Rose will earn from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
- Total number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets
- Total earnings = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, calculate Rose's profit:
- Profit = Total earnings - Total cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To figure out how many lemons Tim will need, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}\)

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled west:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled east:**
   - Elvis then drives east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you with your question about Helen's trip through Germany.

Helen stayed at a hotel for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240.

She also took the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. The cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8.

The total cost for the bus rides is:
7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

Adding the hotel and bus costs together, we get:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for her hotel and bus travels during her trip.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Janet goes to the mall and spends $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her younger sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Her parents gave her $40. Let's figure out how much money she has left.

First, let's add up all her expenses:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for two people, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total expenses: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, subtract the total expenses from the amount her parents gave her:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

"Hi there! I'm Larissa, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks.

First, let's break down the problem:

1. **Days Open:** Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. That means he is open 5 days a week.
2. **Cars Serviced per Day:** Josh services 3 cars each day.
3. **Earnings per Car:** He gets paid $4 for each car he services.

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings:

- **Cars Serviced per Week:** 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week
- **Weekly Earnings:** 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week

Next, we need to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks:

- **Earnings for 2 Weeks:** $60/week * 2 weeks = $120

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (one of each flavor):**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

5. **Baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:
- Total cookies = 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

"To figure out how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down the sale into two parts: the first half of his collection and the second half.

1. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. Half of his collection is 6 toy soldiers.
3. For the first half, he sells 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]
4. For the second half, he sells 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during the 14 days Nate is on vacation:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, when Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Finally, convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To figure out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, I'll start by calculating the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock:

\[ 3 \text{ feet of line} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to break down the costs and the number of days the restaurant is open.

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

So, the total cost per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the watermelons.
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Calculate the total profit.
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price.
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon.
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

   - James is twice as old as Dora, so he is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Age of John's Youngest Son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Determine the peeling rate for Jane:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

First, the cost of the radiator with the discount:
The original price of the radiator is $400, and he gets it for 80% off. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to get the price he pays for the radiator:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the cost of the mechanic's labor:
The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
