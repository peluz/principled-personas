"Okay, let's see. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 more for baking. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself. 

That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. She sells each egg for $2. So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

18"
"Well, let's see. If a robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, that means it needs 1 bolt of white fiber. So, if you add the 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white, you get 3 bolts in total.

"Okay, let's see here. Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That means he put in a total of $130,000. The repairs made the house worth 150% more than what he bought it for. So, 150% of $80,000 is $120,000. Add that to the original $80,000, and the house is now worth $200,000.

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract what he spent from what he sold the house for:
$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"Okay, let's see. James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. So, if I count it out:

3 sprints times 60 meters is 180 meters for one day. Then, he does this 3 times a week, so 180 meters times 3 days is 540 meters.

So, James runs 540 meters a week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed every day. So, for all the chickens, she needs:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups of feed per day} \]

In the morning, she gives them 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given so far is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much more feed she needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, I know that one glass costs $5. But every second glass is cheaper, only 60% of the price. So, 60% of $5 is $3.

Now, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, that means he's buying 8 pairs of glasses. In each pair, one glass costs $5 and the other costs $3.

So, for each pair, he pays:
$5 + $3 = $8

Since he's buying 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs × $8 per pair = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay:
64"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. That's easy enough.

Now, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep} \]

Next, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse has:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we need to add up all the sheep from the three places:
\[ 20 \text{ (Seattle)} + 80 \text{ (Charleston)} + 160 \text{ (Toulouse)} = 260 \text{ sheep} \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can usually download 2 GB every minute. So, if she downloads 40% of the file, that's 80 GB (because 40% of 200 is 80).

Now, to download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, it takes:
\[ 80 \div 2 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, her computer restarts for 20 minutes because of Windows updates. So, we add those 20 minutes to the 40 minutes:
\[ 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

After the restart, Carla has to start the download all over again. So, she needs to download the full 200 GB file again. At 2 GB per minute, that takes:
\[ 200 \div 2 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the 60 minutes from the first part and the 100 minutes from the second part:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.

160"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. That means he goes:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he's 180 miles away from home.

Then, he turns around and tries to get back home in 4 hours. But he spends the first 2 hours just sitting in traffic, so he doesn't move at all during that time.

After the 2 hours, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. That means he covers:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he's now:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 15 \, \text{miles} = 165 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour. That means he covers:
\[ 80 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he's now:
\[ 165 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

At the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Eliza works 40 hours at $10 an hour. So, for those 40 hours, she makes:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, she works 5 more hours, but these are overtime hours. Overtime pays 1.2 times the regular rate. So, her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

For the 5 overtime hours, she makes:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza made $460 this week.

460"
"Okay, let's see here. In the first month, the program got 60 downloads. In the second month, it got three times that, so that's 180 downloads. But in the third month, it dropped by 30%, so we take 30% off 180, which is 54. So, 180 minus 54 is 126 downloads in the third month. Now, if we add all these up: 60 plus 180 plus 126, we get 366 downloads in total over the three months.

366"
"Okay, let's see here. Toula bought some pastries from the bakery. She got 3 dozen donuts, 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. Now, let's figure out how much she spent.

- For the donuts, she bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68. So, 3 times 68 is 204 dollars.
- For the mini cupcakes, she bought 2 dozen, and each dozen costs $80. So, 2 times 80 is 160 dollars.
- For the mini cheesecakes, she bought 6 dozen, and each dozen costs $55. So, 6 times 55 is 330 dollars.

Now, we add all these up:
- 204 dollars for the donuts
- 160 dollars for the mini cupcakes
- 330 dollars for the mini cheesecakes

So, 204 plus 160 plus 330 equals 694 dollars.

The total cost is 694 dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Carlos is planting a lemon tree. It costs him $90 to plant it. Each year, the tree gives him 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. But, it also costs him $3 each year to water and feed the tree.

First, let's see how much money he makes from the lemons each year:
- 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's see how much it costs him each year to take care of the tree:
- $3

So, the money he makes each year after paying for water and feed is:
- $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to figure out how many years it will take for him to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the initial cost by the money he makes each year:
- $90 / $7.5 = 12

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making money from the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Melanie sold some vacuum cleaners at different houses. She started with a bunch, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call that number ""X.""

1. **Green House:**
   - She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   - So, she sold \( \frac{X}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   - After the green house, she had \( X - \frac{X}{3} = \frac{2X}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. **Red House:**
   - She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
   - After the red house, she had \( \frac{2X}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. **Orange House:**
   - She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   - So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2X}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
   - After the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2X}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that after all this, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2X}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
   \[ \frac{2X}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[ \frac{2X}{3} = 12 \]

3. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( X \):
   \[ 2X = 36 \]

4. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ X = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we got 20 students in the dance class. 

- 20% of them are in contemporary dance. So, 20% of 20 is 4 students.
- That leaves us with 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students are in jazz dance.

- 25% of 16 is 4 students.
- So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left.

These 12 students must be in hip-hop dance.

To find out what percentage that is of the whole class:

- 12 out of 20 students is 12/20 = 0.6, which is 60%.

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance.

60%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about fancy math or business stuff.

So, the merchant has two choices:
1. Buy jewelry worth $5,000.
2. Buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

The financial advisor says:
- The jewelry market will go up by 2.5%.
- The electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%.

To figure out which one will make more money, we need to see how much each one will be worth after the market goes up.

For the jewelry:
- If the jewelry is worth $5,000 and the market goes up by 2.5%, it will be worth \( 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \).
- So, the profit from the jewelry is \( 5125 - 5000 = 125 \).

For the electronic gadgets:
- If the gadgets are worth $8,000 and the market goes up by 1.2%, they will be worth \( 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \).
- So, the profit from the gadgets is \( 8096 - 8000 = 96 \).

Now, let's compare the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Gadgets profit: $96

The jewelry will make more money, so the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit from the jewelry is:
125"
"Well, let me think about this. The trains go 80 miles one way, and then they go 150 miles another way. So, if you add those two numbers together, that's how far they went in total. 

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train went 230 miles in the two days."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's see how much Jill makes each week from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets $20 for each hour.
- So, 35 hours times $20 is 700 dollars a week from teaching.

Next, let's see how much she makes each week from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets $30 for each hour.
- So, 15 hours times $30 is 450 dollars a week from coaching.

Now, let's add up what she makes in a week from both jobs:
- 700 dollars from teaching plus 450 dollars from coaching is 1150 dollars a week.

Finally, let's see how much she makes in a year:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- So, 1150 dollars a week times 50 weeks is 57,500 dollars a year.

57500"
"Okay, let's see. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. That's 3 eggs a day. There are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 eggs times 7 days, which is 21 eggs a week. She does this for 4 weeks, so 21 eggs times 4 weeks is 84 eggs. Now, a dozen is 12 eggs, so 84 eggs divided by 12 is 7. So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to walk and count.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then she walked 2 more miles in another hour. So, she's done 6 miles in 2 hours.

She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles. To figure out how long she should take for the whole trail, we can do a simple calculation:

12 miles ÷ 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

So, she needs to finish the whole 12 miles in 3 hours. She's already used 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the last 6 miles, we divide the distance by the time:

6 miles ÷ 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at 6 miles per hour.

6"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, I have 10 liters of orange drink, and it's mostly water—two-thirds of it. So, if I do the math, two-thirds of 10 liters is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But I spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so now I have 9 liters left. The water in those 9 liters is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, I have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it's also mostly water—three-fifths of it. So, three-fifths of 15 liters is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, I mix the 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the mixture is:
\[ 6 \text{ liters (from orange)} + 9 \text{ liters (from pineapple)} = 15 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond must be:
\[ 31 + 6 = 37 \] years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. So, to find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to see how many years have passed since Raymond was 23. That's:
\[ 37 - 23 = 14 \] years.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."
"Okay, let's see. Billy had 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 bought one DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs. The next 2 bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 4 more DVDs. The last 3 didn't buy anything, so that's 0 DVDs. 

So, if we add it all up: 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"Okay, let's see. If a candle gets 2 centimeters shorter every hour, and it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, that's 4 hours. So, if it gets 2 centimeters shorter each hour, in 4 hours it would get:

2 centimeters shorter per hour times 4 hours = 8 centimeters shorter

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter. 

8"
"Okay, let's see. Kyle got the book for $19.50, and that was after a 25% discount. So, the $19.50 is only 75% of the original price, because 100% minus 25% is 75%.

To find out what 100% is, we need to figure out how much 1% is first. We do this by dividing $19.50 by 75, which gives us $0.26 for each 1%.

Now, to find the full price, we multiply $0.26 by 100, because 100% is the whole price. So, $0.26 times 100 is $26.00.

The original price of the book was $26.00.

26.00"
"Okay, let's see. Marie bought a chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. She paid $50 in total. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she bought, and each box costs $8.50.

First, let's add up what we know:
- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: 5 packs at $3 each, so 5 times 3 is $15
- Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 each, so 4 times 1.50 is $6

Now, let's add these up:
- $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid $50 in total, so the money left for pizza is:
- $50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes she bought, we divide $17 by $8.50:
- $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie bought 2 boxes of pizza.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's look at the shorts:
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- So, for the shorts, it's 3 times $16.50, which is $49.50.

Next, the pants:
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- So, for the pants, it's 3 times $22.50, which is $67.50.

Now, the shoes:
- One pair of shoes costs $42.00.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- So, for the shoes, it's 3 times $42.00, which is $126.00.

Finally, we add all these up:
- Shorts: $49.50
- Pants: $67.50
- Shoes: $126.00

Total cost: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

So, Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing items.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Cynthia eats one scoop of ice cream every night. That means in 60 days, she'll eat 60 scoops. 

Now, each carton of ice cream has 15 scoops, and it costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total scoops by the scoops per carton:
60 scoops ÷ 15 scoops/carton = 4 cartons

So, she needs 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00, so:
4 cartons × $4.00/carton = $16.00

Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

16"
"Okay, let's see. Henry went 20 miles before his first stop. Then, he stopped again 15 miles before the end of his 60-mile trip. So, he stopped at 45 miles. To find out how far he went between the stops, we take the 45 miles and subtract the 20 miles. That's 25 miles. So, Henry went 25 miles between his stops.

25"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out.

So, Gloria is looking at some boots and two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which means it's $66. 

Now, if you add those two pairs of heels together, it's $33 + $66, which is $99. 

The problem says that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, if the heels cost $99, the boots must cost $5 more than that. 

So, the boots cost $99 + $5, which is $104.

The boots cost $104."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7 to 11. That means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years. Together, their ages add up to 162.

First, let's add the parts of the ratio:
7 + 11 = 18

Now, we know that 18 parts equal 162 years. To find out what one part is, we divide 162 by 18:
162 ÷ 18 = 9

So, one part is 9 years. Now, we can find out how old each of them is:
- Darrell's age: 7 parts × 9 years/part = 63 years
- Allen's age: 11 parts × 9 years/part = 99 years

Now, we need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years:
99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years.

109"
"Okay, let's see here. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans. The second friend says it's 20 more than half of 80, so that's 40 plus 20, which is 60. The third friend says it's 25% more than 80. Now, 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 plus 20 is 100.

Now, to find the average, we add these numbers up: 80, 60, and 100. That's 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are 3 guesses. So, 240 divided by 3 is 80.

The average guess is 80."
"Well, let's see. John's got 10 dogs, and he spends half an hour on each dog every day. So, that's 10 dogs times half an hour, which is 5 hours a day. Now, there are 7 days in a week, so 5 hours a day times 7 days is 35 hours a week. 

35"
"Okay, let's think about this. Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. 

If we take away the extra 30 gold coins, we can split the rest of the coins equally between gold and silver. So, 110 coins minus 30 extra gold coins gives us 80 coins. These 80 coins are split equally between gold and silver, so 40 silver coins and 40 gold coins.

But we need to add back the 30 extra gold coins, so 40 gold coins plus 30 more gold coins equals 70 gold coins.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 

70"
"Okay, let's see. Raymond has 40 jewels. Half of that is 20. Aaron has 5 more than that, so Aaron has 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 23 jewels.

"Okay, let's see. Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we need to figure out what 25% more than 4 points is. 

25% of 4 is 1 (because 25% is like a quarter, and a quarter of 4 is 1).

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 points plus 1 point, which is 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both halves:
4 points + 5 points = 9 points.

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points. 

9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Terry eats 2 yogurts every day. So, in 30 days, he would eat:
2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, the yogurts are on sale, 4 for $5.00. To find out how much one yogurt costs, we do:
$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

So, if Terry eats 60 yogurts, and each one costs $1.25, then he spends:
60 yogurts × $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

75.00"
"Well, let's see. John had 13 lego sets and sold 'em all. He used the money to buy some video games and had a bit left over. So, he don't have any of those lego sets no more. He's got 0 lego sets left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much, which means 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, to find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the total distance by the total time:
60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at 10 miles per hour.

10"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Now, skipping is half as fast as running, so if she skips at 3 miles per hour, she must run at 6 miles per hour. That's because 3 miles per hour is half of 6 miles per hour.

Next, running is four times faster than walking. So, if she runs at 6 miles per hour, she must walk at 1.5 miles per hour. That's because 6 miles per hour divided by 4 is 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. If she has 6 hours in total, one-third of that time is 2 hours, and two-thirds of that time is 4 hours.

So, in 2 hours of running, she covers:
- 2 hours × 6 miles per hour = 12 miles

And in 4 hours of walking, she covers:
- 4 hours × 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles

Adding these distances together, she covers:
- 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

So, in 6 hours, Dana can travel 18 miles.

"Well, let's see. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, that means Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Now, if Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, then Brandon’s iPhone must be 8 years old.

"Well, let me think about this. If Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone she can throw it three times as far, that means she can throw it 1200 feet. The dragon's flames only reach 1000 feet. So, if she stands just outside the dragon's flames, she can still hit the dragon. 

To figure out how far outside the dragon's flames she can stand, we need to subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone. 

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

"Well, let's see. Grandma Jones made 5 apple pies, and she cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, that's 5 times 8, which is 40 pieces of pie. At the end, there were 14 pieces left. So, the guests must have taken 40 minus 14, which is 26 pieces. 

26"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, a bag of chips has 250 calories for each serving, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. That means the whole bag has:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, if you've already eaten 1800 calories today and your goal is 2000 calories, you can eat:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many grams of chips that is, we need to know how many grams are in 200 calories. Since the whole bag (300g) has 1250 calories, we can figure out how many grams are in 1 calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

So, for 200 calories, you can eat:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Charlie needs to make 20 candles. He can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. So, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax.

Now, 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10. So, for 2 pounds, it will cost him 2 times $10, which is $20.

Charlie sells each candle for $2. So, if he sells 20 candles, he will make 20 times $2, which is $40.

To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract the cost from the money he makes. So, $40 minus $20 is $20.

So, Charlie's net profit is $20.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Each article takes 4 hours, so:
5 articles × 4 hours/article = 20 hours

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote:
2/5 of 5 articles = 2 more articles
5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles
7 articles × 4 hours/article = 28 hours

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. So, she wrote:
2 × 7 articles = 14 articles
14 articles × 4 hours/article = 56 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:
20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours

So, Meredith spent 104 hours writing articles over the three days."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Candice had 80 Post-it notes to start with. She went to the store and got more, but we don't know how many yet. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, and she had 23 left over at the end.

First, let's see how many Post-it notes she had in total before she used them. If she used 220 and had 23 left, she must have had:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

So, she had 243 Post-it notes in total before she used them. She started with 80, so the number of Post-it notes she got from the store is:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the package she bought had 163 Post-it notes.

\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, to find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide 200 by 40:
\[ 200 \div 40 = 5 \]
So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Now, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, he bought:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, John bought 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the red ties cost:
\[ 40 + (40 \times 0.5) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]
So, each red tie costs $60.

To find out how much John spent on the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]
So, John spent $600 on red ties.

Now, to find out the total amount John spent on all the ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
\[ 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

\[
\boxed{800}

"Well, let's see. If Tracy had a wire that was 4 feet long, and we know that 1 foot is 12 inches, then 4 feet is 48 inches. If she cut this wire into pieces that are 6 inches each, we just need to figure out how many 6-inch pieces fit into 48 inches. 

So, 48 divided by 6 is 8. 

Tracy got 8 pieces."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how many units are in the whole building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply 15 by 8:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]
So, there are 120 units in total.

Now, we're told that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we take 3/4 of 120:
\[ 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \]
So, 90 units are occupied.

To find out how many units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
30"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many eggs Lloyd's chickens make in a week. If they make 252 eggs every day, and there are 7 days in a week, then:
252 eggs/day × 7 days = 1764 eggs in a week.

Next, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs that is. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen:
1764 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens.

Now, if Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, then:
147 dozens × $2/dozen = $294.

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

294"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about boats and time.

So, Tom's boat goes 10 miles every hour. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. So, he goes 10 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 30 miles.

Now, he's coming back, but his boat is slower. It only goes 6 miles every hour. To figure out how long it takes to come back, we divide the distance by the speed. So, 30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour is 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"Okay, let's think about this. Uriah's book bag is too heavy, and he needs to take out 15 pounds. He's got comic books and toys in there. Each comic book is 1/4 pound, and each toy is 1/2 pound.

If he takes out 30 comic books, that's 30 times 1/4 pound, which is 7.5 pounds. So, he's already taken out 7.5 pounds with the comic books.

He still needs to take out 15 pounds minus the 7.5 pounds he already took out, which is 7.5 pounds more.

Each toy is 1/2 pound, so to take out 7.5 pounds, he needs to take out 7.5 divided by 1/2, which is 15 toys.

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Each truck tire costs $60 to fix, so for 6 truck tires, that's:
\[ 6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

Each car tire costs $40 to fix, so for 4 car tires, that's:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money made on Thursday is:
\[ 360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars} \]

On Friday, the mechanic only fixed 12 car tires. Each car tire costs $40 to fix, so for 12 car tires, that's:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's see which day the mechanic made more money:
- Thursday: 520 dollars
- Friday: 480 dollars

The difference in money made between the two days is:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the mechanic made 40 dollars more on Thursday.

"Well, let's see. The Doubtfire sisters got 7 little kittens from the shelter. Now, their momma says that their cat Patchy had 3 times as many as the ones they adopted, so that's 21 kittens.

"Well, let's see. Peter's got 42 dollars, and he wants to go to the movies. Each time he goes, he spends 7 dollars on a ticket and 7 dollars on popcorn. That's 14 dollars each time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know the bridge can only hold 5000 pounds. That's the most it can take.

Next, we have the truck and the driver. Together, they weigh 3755 pounds. So, we need to see how much weight is left for the boxes.

We do this by subtracting the weight of the truck and driver from the total weight the bridge can hold:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds.

This means we have 1245 pounds left for the boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes we can put on the truck, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:
1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes.

So, the truck can carry 83 boxes without going over the bridge's weight limit.

"Okay, let's see here. Stephen's groceries cost $40.00. The delivery people added a 25% fee, which is like a quarter more, so that's $10.00 extra. Then, they added $3.00 for bringing the stuff to his door. Stephen also gave a $4.00 tip. So, we add all that up:

$40.00 (groceries) + $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery) + $4.00 (tip) = $57.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"Okay, let's see. If there are 6 clusters of 20 raspberries each, that's like having 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries. Then, there are also 67 more raspberries just hanging around. So, if we add those 120 raspberries to the 67, we get 187 raspberries in total.

"Okay, let's see. Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She pays $500 for the stuff to make it and $800 for the jeweler to put it all together. That's $500 + $800, which is $1300. Then, she pays 10% of that to get it insured. Ten percent of $1300 is $130. So, she pays $1300 for the brooch and $130 for the insurance. All together, that's $1300 + $130, which is $1430.

"Okay, let's see. If Marcy works for 30 years, she gets a part of the $50,000 pension. She starts getting a part after 20 years, and for each year after that, she gets 5% more of the $50,000.

So, she works 10 years more after the 20 years. That's 10 years times 5%, which is 50% of the $50,000.

Now, 50% of $50,000 is $25,000.

So, if she quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $25,000.

$25,000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Aleena pays $140 every month for the first 6 months. So, for 6 months, she pays:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, for the next 6 months, she pays 10% less. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $140:
\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the new monthly charge is:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

For the next 6 months, she pays:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount she paid for the whole year, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, by the end of the year, Aleena paid:
1596"
"Well, let's see. Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill her tank back up. So, she gets 25 miles for every gallon of gas, 'cause 100 miles divided by 4 gallons is 25 miles per gallon. Her tank holds 12 gallons, so if she gets 25 miles for each gallon, then with 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles. That's 25 miles times 12 gallons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So, in one session, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, which adds up to 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week. So, in one week, he spends 3 hours per session times 3 sessions, which is 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. So, we take the 9 hours he spends in one week and multiply it by 4 weeks. That's 9 hours times 4, which equals 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

36 hours"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. So, that's 5 players for the girls' team and 5 players for the boys' team, which makes 10 players in total for each school. Each school also has a coach for the girls' team and a coach for the boys' team, so that's 2 coaches per school. 

Now, if we add the players and the coaches together, we get 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply 12 people by 4 schools, which gives us 48 people in total.

48"
"Okay, let's see here. The treasure chest has 175 diamonds. Now, it says there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so that means there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. It also says there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that means there are 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Now, to find out how many gems there are in total, we add them all up: 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems.

So, there are 595 gems in the chest."
"Well, let's see. If there are 60 girls and twice as many boys, that means there are 120 boys. So, in total, there are 60 girls plus 120 boys, which makes 180 students. Now, if there are 5 students for every teacher, we need to figure out how many groups of 5 there are in 180. That would be 180 divided by 5, which is 36. So, there must be 36 teachers.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself. Bailey ends up with $100 after 8 weeks. Each week, she gets $5. So, over 8 weeks, she gets:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

That means she got $40 from her allowance. If she has $100 at the end, and $40 of that came from her allowance, then the rest must be what she started with. So, we subtract the $40 from the $100:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey must have started with $60.

60"
"Okay, let's see here. Judy teaches dance classes, right? She does 5 classes every weekday, and 8 classes on Saturday. Each class has 15 students, and she charges each student $15.00. 

First, let's figure out how many classes she does in a week:
- She does 5 classes each day for 5 days, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- Plus, she does 8 classes on Saturday.
- So, in total, she does 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

Next, let's find out how many students she has in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Now, to find out how much money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00.

So, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

43 brownies times 3 dollars each is 129 dollars.

Next, the cheesecakes:
23 slices times 4 dollars each is 92 dollars.

Now, we add 'em up:
129 dollars from the brownies plus 92 dollars from the cheesecakes is 221 dollars.

So, Tommy raised 221 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done math like this before.

First, Shiela bought 5 cell phones, and each one costs $150. So, we need to find out how much all 5 phones cost together:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]
So, the phones cost $750 in total.

Next, there's a 2% interest on the total cost. To find out how much the interest is, we take 2% of $750:
\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]
So, the interest is $15.

Now, we add the interest to the total cost of the phones to find out how much Shiela needs to pay in total:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]
So, Shiela needs to pay $765 in total.

Since she's paying this over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she pays each month:
\[ 765 \div 3 = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

\[
\boxed{255}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds cost $2.74, which rounds to $3.
- Petunias cost $1.87, which rounds to $2.
- Begonias cost $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Now, let's see how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- For marigolds, he sells 12 pots at $3 each, so that's 12 * 3 = $36.
- For petunias, he sells 9 pots at $2 each, so that's 9 * 2 = $18.
- For begonias, he sells 17 pots at $2 each, so that's 17 * 2 = $34.

Finally, we add up all the money he makes:
- Total money = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

So, Artie will make $88.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on the beach with Luke.

So, Luke's sandcastle has 4 levels, and each level is half the size of the one below it. The top level, which is the smallest, is 16 square feet. 

If the top level is 16 square feet, the level below it (the third level) must be twice that, so it's 32 square feet. 

The second level is twice the size of the third level, so it's 64 square feet. 

The bottom level, which is the biggest, is twice the size of the second level, so it's 128 square feet.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the square footage and divide by the number of levels:
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet in total.

There are 4 levels, so we divide 240 by 4:
240 ÷ 4 = 60

So, the average square footage of a level is 60."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the puppy needs 1 cup of food every day for the first 180 days. So, if you do the math:
180 days times 1 cup each day, that's 180 cups of food.

Next, for the rest of the year, which is 365 days minus the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food each day. So, 365 minus 180 is 185 days. Now, 185 days times 2 cups each day, that's 370 cups of food.

Now, add the two amounts together:
180 cups plus 370 cups, that's 550 cups of food for the whole year.

Each bag has 110 cups of food. To find out how many bags you need, you divide the total cups by the cups per bag:
550 cups divided by 110 cups per bag, that's 5 bags.

So, Cecilia will need 5 bags of dog food for the first year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Now, if Sarah does 4 times as much as David, we can figure out how much David does by dividing Sarah's amount by 4. So, David does:

400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

Now, Raymond does half as much as Sarah. So, we take Sarah's 400 pounds and divide it by 2:

400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find out the difference between what Raymond and David do, we subtract David's amount from Raymond's:

200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50, to get 18 flowers, he needs 6 packages because 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, 6 packages at $2.50 each would cost him 6 times 2.50, which is $15.

Now, if he buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1, to get 18 flowers, he needs 9 packages because 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, 9 packages at $1 each would cost him 9 times 1, which is $9.

So, if he buys the flowers in packages of 2, he spends $9, but if he buys them in packages of 3, he spends $15. The difference between $15 and $9 is $6.

Vincent saves $6 by buying the flowers in packages of 2.

"Well, let's see. The groomer usually charges $100, but they're givin' John a 30% discount 'cause it's his first time. So, 30% of $100 is $30. If you take $30 off $100, that leaves $70. So, the grooming costs $70.

70"
"Okay, let's see. Two girls each got 1/6 of 24 liters of water. So, each girl got 4 liters because 24 divided by 6 is 4. Two girls means 4 liters times 2, which is 8 liters. Then, a boy got 6 liters. So, 8 liters for the girls plus 6 liters for the boy is 14 liters. If there were 24 liters to start with, and 14 liters were taken, that leaves 10 liters.

"Okay, let's see here. Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he got 21 more from the store, so that's 10 + 21, which is 31 stickers. He got 23 more for his birthday, so 31 + 23 is 54 stickers. Then he gave 9 to his sister, so 54 - 9 is 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 to decorate a card, so 45 - 28 is 17 stickers left.

"Okay, let's see here. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Now, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, 4 times 125 is 500. Then, 2 pounds less than 500 is 498. 

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together. So, 125 plus 498 is 623 pounds.

So, their combined weight is:

"Okay, let's see. Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. So, that's 3 times 25, which is 75 roses in total. Now, each rose has 8 thorns. So, 75 roses times 8 thorns is... 600 thorns. 

So, the total number of thorns is:
600"
"Okay, let's think about this. The team played 22 games, and they won 8 more games than they lost. 

If we say they lost \( L \) games, then they won \( L + 8 \) games. 

The total number of games is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

So, if we add those together:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Now, we need to figure out what \( L \) is. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The team won 15 games.

"Okay, let's think about this. Gene has been going on vacations since he was 23, and he's now 34. That means he's been going on vacations for 11 years. Each year, he goes on 4 vacations and gets a shirt from each one. So, if he gets 4 shirts every year for 11 years, that's:

4 shirts/year * 11 years = 44 shirts

So, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total. 

44"
"Okay, let's see here. The alarm went off three times today.

- The first time, it rang 4 times.
- The second time, it rang 3 times as much as the first time, so that's 12 times.
- The third time, it rang half as much as the second time, so that's 6 times.

Now, if we add all those up:
4 + 12 + 6 = 22

So, the alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **First, let's find out what Sylvie earns in a year right now:**
   - She gets $600 every month.
   - So, in a year, she earns $600 times 12 months, which is $7200.

2. **Now, the company gives her a raise after 5 years:**
   - The raise is 10% of her initial salary.
   - 10% of $600 is $60.
   - So, her new monthly salary is $600 + $60, which is $660.

3. **Let's find out what she earns in a year with the new salary:**
   - With the new monthly salary of $660, she earns $660 times 12 months, which is $7920 in a year.

4. **The raise only happens once, so her salary stays the same for the next 3 years:**
   - So, after 3 more years, she still earns $7920 in a year.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

7920"
"Okay, let's think about this. If Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, and together they sold 88,000 copies, we can figure out how many Harald sold.

Imagine Harald sold a certain number of copies, and we'll call that number \( H \). Marilyn sold 10 times that number, so she sold \( 10H \) copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

That means:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide 88,000 by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8,000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Christina invited 16 friends, but not all of them will show up. Since 1 out of every 4 friends doesn't come, that means 3 out of every 4 friends do come. So, we need to find out how many friends will actually show up:

16 friends × 3/4 = 12 friends will come.

Next, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend she invited, not just the ones who show up. So, we need to calculate how many gift bags she needs for 16 friends:

16 friends × 0.75 gift bags per friend = 12 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so we need to find out how much 12 gift bags will cost:

12 gift bags × $2 per gift bag = $24.

So, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags.

24"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

First, we need to know how much potato salad the grown-up dinos will eat. Each grown-up dino eats 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 grown-up dinos, so:
10 pounds per dino * 20 dinos = 200 pounds of potato salad for the grown-ups.

Next, we need to figure out how much the little dinos will eat. Each little dino eats half as much as a grown-up, so that's 5 pounds per little dino. There are 5 little dinos, so:
5 pounds per little dino * 5 little dinos = 25 pounds of potato salad for the little ones.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total:
200 pounds (for the grown-ups) + 25 pounds (for the little ones) = 225 pounds of potato salad.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"Okay, let's see here. Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so that's 6 pets for Marcia. Jan has three times as many as Marcia, so that's 18 pets for Jan. Now, if we add 'em all up: 4 for Cindy, 6 for Marcia, and 18 for Jan, that makes 28 pets in total.

28"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

Emily has four kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. James is 10 years old, and he's 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 11 years old.

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 9 years old.

Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson. So, if Amy is 9, then Jackson must be 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. It says Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee is 38 seconds, Gerald must have been 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald changed his diet and got 10% faster. If he was 10% faster, that means he can now run the same distance in 90% of the time it used to take him. 

To find 90% of 40 seconds, I do 40 times 0.90, which is 36 seconds.

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

36"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Dogs and Cats:**
   - We know there are 60 dogs.
   - For every dog, there are 2 cats. So, if there are 60 dogs, there must be:
     \[
     60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ cats}
     \]

2. **Combined Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   - Now, let's add the number of dogs and cats together:
     \[
     60 + 120 = 180
     \]

3. **Rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from 180:
     \[
     180 - 12 = 168 \text{ rabbits}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   - Finally, we add up all the pets: dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[
     60 + 120 + 168 = 348
     \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know there are 200 students in Grade 5. Out of these, 2 out of every 5 students are boys. So, to find out how many boys there are, we can do:

200 students / 5 = 40
40 students * 2 = 80 boys

So, there are 80 boys. That means the rest must be girls. To find out how many girls there are, we do:

200 students - 80 boys = 120 girls

Now, we're told that 2 out of every 3 girls are in the Girl Scouts. So, to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts, we can do:

120 girls / 3 = 40
40 girls * 2 = 80 girls in the Girl Scouts

To find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

120 girls - 80 girls in the Girl Scouts = 40 girls not in the Girl Scouts

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is 40."
"Okay, let's see. Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of that. So, if Harry's 9 hours is the whole thing, James slept 2 parts out of 3 of those 9 hours. 

To figure out how much that is, I can split 9 hours into 3 equal parts. Each part is 3 hours. So, 2 parts would be 6 hours. 

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept, I just need to see the difference between 9 hours and 6 hours. That's 3 hours.

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Freda makes tomato sauce, and when she cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, if she ends up with 32 ounces of sauce, that means she must have started with twice that much in tomatoes. 

So, 32 ounces of sauce means she started with:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces of tomatoes} \]

Each can of tomatoes she uses is 16 ounces, and each can has 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can:
\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes she used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

12"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes, then 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes. Also, 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, if 5 cars took an exit, that means 25 cars are left to drive through the traffic jam. Out of these 25 cars, 20 drove through in the second 15 minutes. That means the rest must have driven through in the first 15 minutes.

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 - 20 = 5 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out in my head.

Mary got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, first, we need to figure out how many plants she had before the new ones:

2 plants on each ledge, and she has 40 ledges, so:
2 plants/ledge × 40 ledges = 80 plants

Now, she got 18 more plants, so:
80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

Mary is giving away 1 plant from each of her 40 ledges, so she's giving away:
1 plant/ledge × 40 ledges = 40 plants

So, after giving away 40 plants, she will have:
98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

Mary will have 58 potted plants left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're countin' marbles.

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. That's easy to remember.
2. The second friend rang it 1/4 more than the first friend. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5. Add that to 20, and the second friend rang it 25 times.
3. The fourth friend rang it 60 times. That's a lot!
4. The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend. So, 60 plus 10 is 70 times.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
- First friend: 20
- Second friend: 25
- Third friend: 70
- Fourth friend: 60

20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the doorbell rang 175 times in total."
"Okay, let's see. Solo's got to read a bunch of pages from different books. He needs to read 4 pages from Science, 20 from Social Studies, 7 from History, and 8 from Geography. That's a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8, which is 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 39 - 15, which is 24 pages left to read.

He's got 4 more days to finish all this reading. So, to figure out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the 24 pages by 4 days. That's 24 ÷ 4, which is 6 pages a day.

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

6"
"Well, let's see. John drinks water with his breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then one more before bed. That's 4 glasses a day. He does this from Monday to Friday, so that's 4 glasses times 5 days, which gives us 20 glasses. On Saturday and Sunday, he skips the water at dinner and has a soda instead, so he only drinks 3 glasses of water each of those days. That's 3 glasses times 2 days, which is 6 glasses. So, if we add the 20 glasses from the weekdays and the 6 glasses from the weekend, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. The city is 42 miles wide. 

To figure out how long it takes to cover the whole city, we need to see how many 3-mile chunks fit into 42 miles. 

42 miles divided by 3 miles per chunk is 14 chunks. 

If each chunk takes 10 minutes, then 14 chunks will take 14 times 10 minutes. 

14 times 10 is 140 minutes.

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Poppy has a 1000-piece puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces in place. A quarter of 1000 is 250 pieces. So, she puts 250 pieces in place.

Now, we need to figure out how many pieces are left. If she put 250 pieces in place, then there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Next, her mom comes and puts a third of the remaining pieces in place. A third of 750 is 250 pieces. So, her mom puts 250 pieces in place.

Now, we need to figure out how many pieces are left after her mom puts 250 pieces in place. If there were 750 pieces left and her mom put 250 pieces in place, then there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500.

John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we need to figure out the inner space of each box.

First, let's figure out the inner dimensions of one box:
- The length is 5 inches, but we need to take away 1 inch from each side for the walls, so it's 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
- The width is 6 inches, and we take away 1 inch from each side, so it's 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
- The height is 4 inches, and we take away 1 inch from the top and bottom, so it's 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, let's find the inner volume of one box:
- We multiply the inner length, width, and height: 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume for all 3 boxes:
- We multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

On Monday, Frankie watched 1 hour of TV.
On Tuesday, he watched another 1 hour of TV.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV.

So, let's add all that up:
1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. So, to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we divide:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, Henry ended up with 110 cookies after he dropped 5. That means before he dropped them, he had 115 cookies. But he said he baked 15 more than he planned. So, if we take away those extra 15, he was aiming for 100 cookies.

Now, he wanted to make twice as many as last year. If 100 is twice as many, then last year he must have made half of 100. Half of 100 is 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, the gas costs $3.00 a gallon. If you buy 10 gallons, you do the math:
\[ 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00 \]
So, the gas costs $30.00 before any cashback.

Now, the app gives you $0.20 back for each gallon. For 10 gallons, you get:
\[ 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00 \]
So, you get $2.00 back.

To find out how much you actually pay, you subtract the cashback from the total cost:
\[ 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \]

So, after the cashback, you pay $28.00.

28.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting apples.

First, we need to know how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. Her roll-up was 2 wide and 24 long. So, we multiply:
2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Next, we figure out how many Marcell ate. His roll-up was 3 wide and 14 long. So, we multiply:
3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate:
48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of people, which is 2:
90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.

So, on average, they ate 45 roll-ups each.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, if we divide 64 seconds by 16 seconds, we get 4. This means she rowed 4 times the distance she rows in 16 seconds.

Now, 4 times 20 feet is 80 feet. So, Julia rowed 80 feet in 64 seconds.

Next, we need to figure out how much water got into the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, for 80 feet, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet. 

80 feet divided by 10 feet is 8. So, the boat took on 2 liters of water 8 times.

2 liters times 8 is 16 liters.

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

16 liters"
"Okay, let's think about this. There are 4 teachers, and each one uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons a day. So, that's 8 lessons in total. Now, if the whiteboard gets cleaned 3 times for each lesson, then we just need to multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson. 

So, 8 lessons times 3 cleanings per lesson equals 24 cleanings in a day.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos.
3. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 divided by 6, which is 300 photos.
4. The number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.
5. So, 300 photos is 50 times the number of ducks.
6. To find the number of ducks, we divide 300 by 50, which is 6.

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is 6."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, let's see how much Sasha spent on the lumber:
- She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each cost her $10.
  So, 10 boards * $10 = $100.
- She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each cost her $16.
  So, 5 boards * $16 = $80.

Now, let's add up what she spent in total:
- $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's figure out how much she can sell the lumber for now that prices have gone up by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate how much she will make from selling all the boards:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15 = $150.
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24 = $120.

Adding up the total money she will make:
- $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find out her profit, we subtract what she spent from what she will make:
- $270 - $180 = $90.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own.

So, Katy makes her coffee with a special mix. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. That means for every 20 parts (7 + 13) of her mix, 7 parts are sugar.

Now, she used a total of 120 parts of her mix. To find out how many parts each part is, we divide 120 by 20. That gives us 6. So, each part of her mix is 6.

Since 7 parts of her mix are sugar, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used. That's 42 teaspoons of sugar.

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar."

On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, that's:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:
30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles.

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were brought in on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000. That was 30% more than what Lylah was making. So, to find out what Lylah was making, we need to figure out what 30% of Lylah's salary is and add it to her salary to get Adrien's salary.

If we call Lylah's salary ""L,"" then:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah was making about $30,769.23 four years ago.

Now, Adrien's salary went up by 40% over the past four years. So, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ 56000 \]

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%, so her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ 43076.92 \]

To find out how much they are making together now, we add their new salaries:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary they are making four years later is:
99076.92"

   - So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 6 hours each night.
   - That's 6 hours on Tuesday and 6 hours on Wednesday, which adds up to 12 hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - After those two busy nights, she got a bit more sleep, 1 hour more than the 6 hours she got on Tuesday and Wednesday.

4. **Total for the week:**
   - Now, let's add it all up:
   - 8 hours on Monday, 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours for the rest of the week.
   - 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week."
"Well, let's see. Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour, and she does that for 3 hours. So, that's 10 miles times 3, which is 30 miles. After that, she slows down to 5 miles an hour and keeps running for 4 more hours. So, 5 miles times 4 hours is 20 miles. Add those together, 30 miles plus 20 miles, and Rosie runs a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this. Jennie had 60 letters that needed stamps. She put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 20. So, she stamped 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means before Jennie started, there must have been 30 minus the 20 she just stamped, which is 10. So, there were 10 letters already stamped when Jennie began.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Julia bought some spoons, and her husband bought 5 more. She used 3 spoons to taste the stew, and then she had 12 spoons left when she set the table.

So, if she had 12 spoons after using 3, that means she had 15 spoons before she used any. 

Now, if her husband bought 5 spoons, and she had 15 spoons in total, that means the package she bought must have had 10 spoons.

So, the package Julia bought had 10 spoons.

"Well, let's see. Dylan got 38 chicken sausages. He also got 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so that's 38 plus 6, which makes 44 fish sausages. Now, to find out how many sausages he got in total, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together. So, 38 plus 44 is 82 sausages in all.

82"
"Okay, let's see. If Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, that means Amy made 70 friends. So, if we add Lily's 50 friends and Amy's 70 friends together, they have 120 friends in total.

120"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

1. **Cost of Peppers:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of Watermelons:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs.
   - So, a watermelon costs \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   - So, an orange costs \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost for Each Item:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
     - Total for watermelons: \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers:
     - Total for peppers: \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges:
     - Total for oranges: \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

5. **Total Amount Dillon Will Spend:**
   - Add up all the costs:
     - Total amount: \( 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \) dollars.

So, Dillon will spend 880 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **How many people does the hospital see in a day?**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.

2. **How long does each visit take?**
   - Each visit takes 24 minutes.

3. **How many minutes does the hospital spend on all the patients in a day?**
   - 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes.

4. **How many hours is that?**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

5. **How much does the hospital charge patients per hour?**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.

6. **How much money does the hospital make from patients in a day?**
   - 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

7. **How much do the doctors charge the hospital per hour?**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.

8. **How much does the hospital pay the doctors in a day?**
   - 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

9. **How much profit does the hospital make?**
   - Profit = Money made from patients - Money paid to doctors
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

10000"
"Okay, let's see. Nissa hires 60 elves for her Santa village. After some kids get sick on some of the elves, a third of them decide they've had enough and leave. So, a third of 60 is 20. That means 20 elves leave.

Now, we have 60 - 20, which is 40 elves left. Then, 10 more elves leave because some kids were mean and kicked them. So, 40 - 10 is 30.

So, 30 elves are left.

30"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. Then in June, he spent $60 less, which means he spent $440. If you add those two amounts together, $500 and $440, you get $940. So, Joseph spent a total of $940 in May and June.

940"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're countin' marbles.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. That's 4 rides for Pam.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. That's 6 rides for Fred.

Now, let's add Pam's and Fred's rides together:
4 rides (Pam) + 6 rides (Fred) = 10 rides total.

Each ride costs 6 tickets. So, we need to multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
10 rides × 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

So, they used 60 tickets that day.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. That's easy to remember.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as much as he did on Monday. So, if he walked 4 miles on Monday, on Tuesday he walked 6 times 4, which is 24 miles. That's a lot of walking!

Now, we know that from Monday to Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles. We already know he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. So, let's add those up: 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday. So, 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

13"
"Okay, let's see. Tom gets 4 car washes every month, and each one costs him $15. So, for one month, he pays 4 times 15, which is $60. Now, to find out how much he pays in a whole year, we need to multiply that by 12, because there are 12 months in a year. So, 60 times 12 is $720. 

720"
"Okay, let's see. Brian had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 15. Now, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times what Brian has. So, 3 times 15 is 45, and 5 less than that is 40. So, Bobby has 40 video games.

40"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in the whole world. Now, one third of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we need to find out how many unicorns that is:

27 divided by 3 is 9. So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we're told that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, we need to find out how many of the 9 unicorns are female:

9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 times 2 is 6.

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

6"
"Okay, let's see here. Rory's order includes:

- 2 subs at $7.50 each, so that's 2 times $7.50, which is $15.
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, so that's 2 times $1.50, which is $3.
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so that's 2 times $1, which is $2.

Adding those up, $15 for the subs, $3 for the chips, and $2 for the cookies, that's $20 total.

Now, there's a 20% delivery fee. Twenty percent of $20 is $4.

Rory also wants to add a $5 tip.

So, the total is $20 for the food, $4 for the delivery fee, and $5 for the tip, which all adds up to $29.

So, Rory's order will cost $29. 

29.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Mark took a test with 75 questions. He can do 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours to do the test. So, in 8 hours, he would do:
5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions

That means he didn't finish 75 - 40 = 35 questions on the first test.

Next, Mark took another test with 100 questions. He still does 5 questions every hour, and this time he had 6 hours. So, in 6 hours, he would do:
5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions

That means he didn't finish 100 - 30 = 70 questions on the second test.

Now, to find out how many questions he left incomplete in total, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions

So, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.

105"
"Okay, let's see. If there are 12 blue gumballs, and the pink gumballs are 22 more than four times the blue ones, we can figure it out like this:

First, four times the blue gumballs is 4 times 12, which is 48. Then, we add 22 more to that. So, 48 plus 22 is 70.

So, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"Okay, let's see. There are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, if we add the automatic and manual cars together, we get 16 cars. That means the rest must be semi-automatic. 

So, 20 total cars minus 16 cars (automatic and manual) leaves us with 4 semi-automatic cars. 

To find out what percentage that is, we take the 4 semi-automatic cars and divide by the total number of cars, which is 20, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

\[ \frac{4}{20} \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, there are 700 bees in the hive. We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. 

Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \). Then the number of baby bees would be \( 2Q \), and the number of worker bees would be \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, if we add all these up, we get:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. That means there are:
\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \] baby bees,
and
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \] worker bees.

So, the number of worker bees is:
400"
"Okay, let's think about this. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. That's 2 hours times 7 days in a week, which is 14 hours. If he worked those 14 hours instead, and he earns $10 an hour, then he would make 14 times 10, which is 140 dollars. So, Jordan would earn 140 dollars in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"Okay, let's see here. John buys some stuff, and we gotta figure out how much it all costs, including tax on the nonfood items.

First, let's add up the food:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total for food: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add up the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total for nonfood: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

There's a 10% tax on the nonfood items. So, we need to figure out what 10% of 10 dollars is:
10% of 10 dollars = 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar

Now, add the tax to the nonfood total:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, add the total for food and the total for nonfood (including tax):
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

So, everything costs 16 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Kim has 3 clients already and is talking to 5 more. So, he's got:
3 + 5 = 8 clients in total.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 each, so for 2 bottles, that's:
2 * $2 = $4 for bleach per client.

The pack of cloths costs $5. So, for each client, the total cost is:
$4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.

Now, for 8 clients, the total cost is:
8 * $9 = $72.

Kim says he will make $92 in total income each week. To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
$92 - $72 = $20.

So, Kim will make $20 in profit each week.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about farming but not much about fancy math.

John has a big field, 10 hectares, and he grows pineapples. In each part of his field, he can grow 100 pineapples. So, if we count all the pineapples in his whole field, it's like having 10 groups of 100 pineapples. That's 1000 pineapples in total.

Now, John can pick these pineapples every 3 months. Since a year has 12 months, he can pick them 4 times a year. So, if he picks 1000 pineapples each time, and he does this 4 times, he ends up with:

1000 pineapples × 4 = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Well, let's see. Johnny got one box with 500 pieces. Then he got another one that had 3 times more, so that's 1500 pieces. And the last one had only a quarter of the first one, so that's 125 pieces. If we add all them up, it's 500 plus 1500 plus 125, which makes 2125 pieces. So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

2125"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who's not too good with numbers, but I'll try my best.

So, Debra is watching a beehive. In the first 6 hours, she sees 30 bees fly away. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees come back. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees come back.

After that, in the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees as the first 30 fly away. Twice 30 is 60, so 60 more bees fly away.

Now, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that flew away and didn't come back yet come back. So, we need to figure out how many bees that is. 

First, 30 bees flew away and 15 came back, so 15 bees are still out. Then, 60 more bees flew away and didn't come back yet. So, in the last 6 hours, 15 (from the first group) + 60 (from the second group) = 75 bees come back.

So, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"Okay, let's see. The adult ticket costs $12 and the child ticket costs $10. So, if Brittany's mom bought one of each, that's $12 plus $10, which is $22. She got $8 back in change, so she must have given the cashier $22 plus $8, which is $30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how far Steve and Tim have to go to get home. Steve lives 3 miles away, and Tim lives 2 miles away. We need to convert these miles into feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute.

1 mile is 5280 feet, so:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's figure out how long it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so:
- Time for Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so:
- Time for Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long the winner will be waiting. The winner is the one who gets home first, and the loser is the one who gets home last.

- Steve takes 36 minutes.
- Tim takes 40 minutes.

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for:
- 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Okay, let's see here. Shawnda's got a bike inflation service, and she charges 25 cents for each tire. 

- 5 people came with bicycles, and bicycles got 2 tires each. So, that's 5 bicycles times 2 tires, which is 10 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, and tricycles got 3 tires each. So, that's 3 tricycles times 3 tires, which is 9 tires.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, and unicycles got 1 tire. So, that's 1 unicycle times 1 tire, which is 1 tire.

Now, we add all the tires up: 10 tires from bicycles, 9 tires from tricycles, and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's 20 tires in total.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so 20 tires times 25 cents is 500 cents. Since 100 cents make a dollar, 500 cents is 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day. 

5"
"Okay, let's see. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, he gets 10 times 6, which is 60 cookies. Each cookie costs 10 cents, so 60 cookies would cost 60 times 10 cents, which is 600 cents or $6. Carl pays with a $10 bill, so he gives $10 and the cookies cost $6. The change he gets back is $10 minus $6, which is $4.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Dave had a big pack of fries and ate 14 of them.
2. Then a seagull came and ate half as many as Dave, so that's 7 more fries.
3. After that, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries, so that's 9 more fries.
4. A raccoon then took two-thirds of what was left.
5. Ants took one more fry.
6. In the end, there were 5 fries left.

Now, let's work backwards to find out how many fries there were at the start.

1. Before the ants took one, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
2. The raccoon took two-thirds of what was left, so the 6 fries are one-third of what was there before the raccoon. So, before the raccoon, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
3. Before the pigeons ate 9 fries, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
4. Before the seagull ate 7 fries, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
5. Before Dave ate 14 fries, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

So, Dave must have had 48 fries when he bought the pack.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, let's see how many hours Kimo spends in class each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long. So, that's 3 hours each of those days. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 hours x 3 days = 9 hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long. So, that's 2 hours x 2 classes = 4 hours each of those days. Since there are 2 days, that's 4 hours x 2 days = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the whole week:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours per week.

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in class over the whole semester. The semester is 16 weeks long, so:
17 hours per week x 16 weeks = 272 hours.

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

272"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my chickens.

First, we got the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is 4/12 feet, which is 1/3 of a foot.
- So, 300 rolls times 1/3 foot each is 100 feet.

Next, the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- 6 inches is 6/12 feet, which is 1/2 of a foot.
- So, 120 croissants times 1/2 foot each is 60 feet.

Then, the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- So, 60 baguettes times 2 feet each is 120 feet.

Now, we add them all up:
- Rolls: 100 feet
- Croissants: 60 feet
- Baguettes: 120 feet

Total length is 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

"Okay, let's figure this out. The monkeys need 200 bananas a month, the gorillas need 400 bananas a month, and the baboons need 100 bananas a month. So, if we add all that up, it's 200 plus 400 plus 100, which is 700 bananas every month for all the apes.

Now, the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months. So, we need to know how many bananas are needed for 2 months. If they need 700 bananas in one month, then for 2 months, it's 700 times 2, which is 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that's 100 yards long. So, each time he runs 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards. If he does this 15 times, he runs:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Now, Kelly runs back and forth once on the same 100-yard field, so that's 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back). So, if she does this 34 times, she runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the 200 yards from her first run, Kelly's total distance is:
\[ 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

80"
"Okay, let's see. Raphael bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, 4 times $1.5 is $6 for the pens. Then, he bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, 2 times $4 is $8 for the notebooks. Lastly, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20. Now, we add all that up: $6 for the pens, $8 for the notebooks, and $20 for the bond paper. That's $6 + $8 + $20, which equals $34. So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Well, let me think this through. Finn first sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more little critters come out from under a lily pad, so that makes 11 plus 6, which is 17 tadpoles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, they add 7 more feet. So, we add 17 and 7:

17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, on Wednesday, the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet. To do that, we first find one-third of 24:

24 ÷ 3 = 8 feet

Then, we multiply that by 2 to get two-thirds:

8 × 2 = 16 feet

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

16 feet"
"Okay, let's see here. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's 10 + 6 + 3, which is 19 fish for Anakin.

Now, Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so that's 10 - 5, which is 5 starfish. He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3, which is 3 sea horses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so that's 3 + 2, which is 5 clownfish.

So, for Locsin, that's 5 + 3 + 5, which is 13 fish.

Now, if we add Anakin's 19 fish and Locsin's 13 fish, we get 19 + 13, which is 32 fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done math like this before.

So, we start with a bag of marbles that costs $20. Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price. That means it goes up by $4 every two months (because 20% of $20 is $4).

Now, we need to know how many times the price goes up in 36 months. Since it goes up every two months, we divide 36 by 2, which gives us 18. So, the price goes up 18 times.

Each time the price goes up, it increases by $4. So, we need to multiply $4 by 18 to find out how much the total increase is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Now, we add this total increase to the original price:
\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, after 36 months, the bag of marbles would cost $92.

5 * 4 = $20

Next, we have 3 action figures. Each action figure costs $5. So, 3 action figures times $5 each is:
3 * 5 = $15

Now, there's a doll. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures would cost:
3 * 5 = $15

So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost is:
20 + 15 + 15 = $50

So, all the toys together are worth $50.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about fancy math.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she can't do 3 hours of her freelance work. She usually makes $35 for each hour of freelance work. So, if she can't work for 3 hours, she loses:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

That means she loses $105 by doing her taxes herself.

Now, if she hires an accountant, the accountant will charge her $90. 

So, if she hires the accountant, she saves the $105 she would have lost, but she has to pay $90 to the accountant. 

To find out how much more money she will have, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she saves:

$105 - $90 = $15

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Okay, let's see. Elvira has €1500 to spend. She buys a computer with some stuff for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. 

First, I add up all the things she bought:
- Computer and stuff: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

So, €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Now, I subtract what she spent from her total money:
- €1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothes. 

77"
"Okay, let's think about this. Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans, and each flan needs 3 eggs. So, she needs 15 times 3, which is 45 eggs in total. Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide 45 by 9. That's 5 times. So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

5"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't had much schooling.

So, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. That means if Brooke is, say, 8 years old, then Seth would be 16 years old. 

Now, in 2 years, both of them will be 2 years older. So, if Brooke is 8 now, she'll be 10 in 2 years. And if Seth is 16 now, he'll be 18 in 2 years.

The problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we need to check if 10 (Brooke's age in 2 years) plus 18 (Seth's age in 2 years) equals 28.

10 + 18 = 28

That's right! So, Seth must be 16 years old right now.

16"
"Well, let's see. If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice what Ethel has, we first figure out what twice Ethel's money is. That's $8 times 2, which is $16. Now, Jimmy has $2 more than that, so we add $2 to $16. That makes $18. So, Jimmy has $18.

18"
"Well, let's see. Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So, that's 20 miles times 5 days, which is 100 miles. On Saturday and Sunday, he only walks 10 miles each day. So, that's 10 miles times 2 days, which is 20 miles. Now, if we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekend, we get 100 miles plus 20 miles, which is 120 miles. So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

120"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting coins.

1. The hat costs $25. That's easy to remember.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, if the hat is $25, the jacket is 3 times that, which is $75.
3. The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket together, and then divide by 2. So, $25 + $75 = $100. Then, $100 divided by 2 is $50.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add up the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

So, each uniform costs $150."
"Well, let's see here. I gotta count all the legs Jake saw.

First, there's them spiders. He saw 80 spiders, and each spider's got 8 legs. So, that's:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \text{ legs} \]

Next, there's them insects. He saw 90 insects, and each insect's got 6 legs. So, that's:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \text{ legs} \]

Lastly, there's them rare mutant invertebrates. He saw 3 of them, and each one's got 10 legs. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, I gotta add all them legs up:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, Jake saw a total of 1210 legs."
"Okay, let's see here. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Sally Four is also 8 years old 'cause they're the same age. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so that makes Granny Red 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 19 years old.

Now, to find the total age, we add 'em all up:
8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to add up all the minimum payments Jessica has to make each month:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

So, $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000. That's the total minimum she has to pay each month.

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out what 50% more is, we need to figure out what 50% of $1000 is:
- 50% of $1000 is $1000 * 0.50 = $500

So, 50% more than $1000 is $1000 + $500 = $1500. That's how much Jessica wants to pay each month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

18000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

Billy's got 60 potatoes to prep for his family reunion. He needs to peel and cut each one. 

First, peeling:
- It takes him about a minute and a half to peel one potato.
- So, for 60 potatoes, that's 60 times 1.5 minutes.
- 60 times 1.5 is 90 minutes.

Next, cutting:
- It takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, that's 60 times 5 seconds.
- 60 times 5 is 300 seconds.
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 300 seconds is 5 minutes.

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting:
- 90 minutes for peeling plus 5 minutes for cutting is 95 minutes.

So, Billy will take 95 minutes to finish prepping all the potatoes.

95"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade. They make 20 glasses of lemonade from one gallon, and they sell each glass for 50 cents. That means they make 20 times 50 cents, which is $10 from one gallon of lemonade.

Now, to make one gallon, they need to spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so that's $5 in total for one gallon.

If they made $25 in profit, that means the money they made from selling the lemonade minus the money they spent on making it is $25.

Let's figure out how many gallons they made. If they make $10 from selling one gallon and it costs them $5 to make it, they make a profit of $5 from each gallon. So, to make $25 in profit, they must have made 5 gallons because $25 divided by $5 (profit per gallon) is 5.

Now, if they made 5 gallons, and it costs $3 for lemons for each gallon, then the total cost for lemons is 5 times $3, which is $15.

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

"Okay, let's see. There were 240 Asians in the race, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the rest must be Chinese. If we take away the 80 Japanese from the 240 Asians, we get 160 Chinese people. Now, if 60 of these Chinese people are boys, then the rest must be girls. So, if we take away the 60 boys from the 160 Chinese people, we get 100 girls. So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Zaid earns 6000 dollars a month. That's a good chunk of change!

1. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, 1/4 of 6000 is 1500 dollars. That's for the roof over his head.
2. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. So, 1/3 of 6000 is 2000 dollars. That's to keep the car running.
3. Now, let's see how much he has left after rent and car fuel. He had 6000, spent 1500 on rent, and 2000 on fuel. So, 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars left.
4. He donates half of what's left to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1250 dollars. So, he gives 1250 to charity.
5. Now, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.
6. He gives his daughter 200 dollars for her weekly expenses and 700 dollars to his wife for groceries and other stuff. So, 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 dollars.

So, after all that, Zaid will have 350 dollars left.

350"
"Okay, let's see. Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more than Monic, so Rani has 46 crabs. If we add all their crabs together, that's 40 + 36 + 46, which gives us 122 crabs in total.

122"
"Well, let's see. Lloyd makes 10 dollars for each hour he helps with math. He worked 5 hours the first week, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50 dollars. The next week, he worked 8 hours, so that's 8 times 10, which is 80 dollars. If we add what he made in both weeks, 50 plus 80, that's 130 dollars. So, Lloyd earned 130 dollars in the first two weeks.

130"
"Okay, let's see. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, that means they got 3 parts out of 4. So, if we split the 80 votes into 4 equal parts, each part would be 20 votes. The winner got 3 of those parts, which is 60 votes. That leaves 1 part for the loser, which is 20 votes.

So, the loser got 20 votes."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Sandra, the florist, ordered some flowers from Fred. She got 200 pink calla lilies, and these were five times the number of white carnations. So, if 200 is five times the number of white carnations, we can figure out how many white carnations there are by dividing 200 by 5:

200 ÷ 5 = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Since she ordered 40 white carnations, the number of red roses she ordered is:

40 × 4 = 160

Fred needs to deliver these 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

160"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

1. Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old.
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is 14 (28 divided by 2).
   - So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
4. If Mark was 19 years old two years ago, he is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
5. Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we have two teams running a 4 by 400 meter relay. Each team has four runners, and each runner runs 400 meters.

**Team 1:**
- Each runner on Team 1 runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- So, the total time for Team 1 is \( 55 \times 4 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2:**
- The first runner on Team 2 runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- So, the total time for Team 2 is \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much faster Team 1 is compared to Team 2:
- Team 1's total time: 220 seconds
- Team 2's total time: 222 seconds
- The difference is \( 222 - 220 = 2 \) seconds.

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

### Step 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
On a six-sided die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers that are greater than 3. 

If I roll the die once, the chance of getting one of these 3 numbers is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
\]

### Step 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers.

If I roll the die once, the chance of getting an even number is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
\]

Now, if I roll the die twice, the chance of getting an even number both times is:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\%
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the Two Probabilities
So, the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, I can divide the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{50\%}{25\%} = 2
\]

This means it's 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3. To express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Well, if Jenna's mom picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, that means Jenna picked 10 apples. So, together they picked 30 apples.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Russell is giving out straw to the animals in the pet store. He's got rats, hamsters, and rabbits. Here's what we know:

- The rats are in 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw in total.
- All together, 160 pieces of straw have been given out.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of straw the hamsters and rabbits get:

- Hamsters: 10 cages, 1 hamster per cage, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, 10 cages * 5 pieces = 50 pieces of straw.
- Rabbits: They get 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw for the hamsters and rabbits:
50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.

So, the rats must have gotten the rest of the straw:
160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Now, we know each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, we need to find out how many rats there are in total:
90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are in 3 cages, and the number of rats is the same in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who doesn't know much about math.

Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed that if she doesn't pay right away, she has to pay extra money each month. This extra money is called interest, and it's 2% of the amount she owes each month.

So, let's break it down month by month:

1. **First Month:**
   - Mandy owes $100.
   - The interest for the first month is 2% of $100.
   - 2% of $100 is $2.
   - So, after the first month, Mandy owes $100 + $2 = $102.

2. **Second Month:**
   - Now, Mandy owes $102.
   - The interest for the second month is 2% of $102.
   - 2% of $102 is $2.04.
   - So, after the second month, Mandy owes $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

3. **Third Month:**
   - Now, Mandy owes $104.04.
   - The interest for the third month is 2% of $104.04.
   - 2% of $104.04 is $2.08.
   - So, after the third month, Mandy owes $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.

So, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

106.12"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The trader buys each bag for $20 and it costs $2 to move each bag to the warehouse. So, each bag costs him $22 in total. He sells each bag for $30, so he makes $8 profit on each bag.

He made a total profit of $400. If he makes $8 profit per bag, we can find out how many bags he sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

\[ \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

50"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

First, the three friends spent $20.25 on tickets. That's the cost of getting into the fair.

Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, we take the ticket cost and subtract $4.50:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
That's how much they spent on food.

Then, they went on two rides, and each ride cost $33. So, for two rides:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
That's the total cost for the rides.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ 34 \]"
"Okay, let's see. John picks peaches for 3 hours. That's 3 times 60 minutes, which is 180 minutes. He picks 2 peaches every minute. So, 180 minutes times 2 peaches is 360 peaches.

"Okay, let's see. If one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week, then ten ducks would need 35 pounds a week, 'cause 3.5 times 10 is 35. Now, to find out how much they need each day, we divide 35 by 7, 'cause there are 7 days in a week. So, 35 divided by 7 is 5. 

So, the ducks need 5 pounds of insects each day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Every year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees. So, he adds 8 trees each year.
3. Over 10 years, he adds 8 trees per year, so that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
4. Adding these 80 trees to the 50 trees he started with, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.
5. But then, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
6. Subtract the 39 trees that die from the 130 trees he had, and he's left with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

So, Tom has 91 trees left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. On Friday, Sue had 18 pink flamingos in her yard.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors took away one third of those pink flamingos. One third of 18 is 6, so they took away 6 pink flamingos.
3. They painted those 6 pink flamingos white and put them back in Sue's yard.
4. So, on Saturday, Sue had 12 pink flamingos left (18 - 6) and 6 white flamingos.
5. On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to Sue's yard.
6. Now, on Sunday, Sue has 12 pink flamingos from before plus the 18 new pink flamingos, which makes 30 pink flamingos.
7. She still has 6 white flamingos from Saturday.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
30 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 24 more pink flamingos.

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Well, let's see. Violetta wants 5 crayons, and each one costs 2 dollars. So, 5 times 2 is 10 dollars for all the crayons. She has 20 dollars, so if she spends 10, she'll have 10 dollars left. That's the change she'll get.

10"
"Okay, let's see. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if a pen costs as much as both of these together, that means a pen costs $1.50.

\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"Okay, so if we got 200 pounds of carrots and we gotta give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants, we just do the math. Each place gets 2 pounds, so that's 2 times 40, which is 80 pounds.

"Okay, let's see here. Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards. 

In the first month, she got three times that many, so that's 60 more cards. 

In the second month, she got 20 less than what she got in the first month, so that's 40 more cards. 

In the third month, she got twice as many as the total of the first and second months. The first and second months together is 60 plus 40, which is 100. So, twice that is 200 more cards.

Now, let's add it all up: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he does the same number for two different publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he gets:
500 sentences × 5 cents = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so that's 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he gets:
500 sentences × 10 cents = 5000 cents

Now, to find out how much he makes in total, we add what he gets from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **One-time reward:**
   - John gets a one-time reward of $5000. That's a nice chunk of change!

2. **Original weekly pay:**
   - John makes $2000 a week. That's his regular pay.

3. **Original yearly pay:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so his original yearly pay is $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **Raise:**
   - John gets a 5% raise. To find out how much that is, we take 5% of $2000.
   - 5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - So, his new weekly pay is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New yearly pay:**
   - With the raise, his new yearly pay is $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money for the year:**
   - Now, we add the one-time reward to his new yearly pay.
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

So, John made $114,200 that year."
"Well, let's see. Josie's got a 10-acre farm, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. So, if we do the math, that's 10 acres times 5 tons, which is 50 tons of grapes. Now, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, 50 tons times 2 barrels is 100 barrels of wine. So, Josie makes 100 barrels of wine each year.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl eats a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich has 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, for sandwiches, he uses \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices of cheese.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl eats omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet has 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet has \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - So, for omelets, he uses \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese and uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and Cheese: 8 slices

Total cheese used: \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\) slices.

So, Carl used 31 slices of cheese."
"Well, let's see. Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's 32 pens to start with. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens, so that's 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens, so that's 12 red pens. 

Now, let's add it all up:
32 (green and yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98 pens.

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

98"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Brinley has taken five tests and got these scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Mr. Bert lets her drop the lowest score, which is 71. So, we only need to think about the other four scores: 89, 92, 100, and 86.

To get an average of 93, we need to figure out what the total of all the scores should be. If we want an average of 93 over five tests, we multiply 93 by 5:

93 * 5 = 465

Now, we add up the four scores we know:

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

To find out what Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the four scores from the total we need:

465 - 367 = 98

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

98"
"Okay, let's see here. Micheal rides his bike a lot, right? So, for the first four weeks, he rides it 5 times every week, and each time he goes 25 kilometers. That means each week he rides 5 times 25, which is 125 kilometers. For four weeks, that's 125 times 4, which is 500 kilometers.

Then, for the next three weeks, he only rides it 2 times a week, but he goes 60 kilometers each time. So, each week he rides 2 times 60, which is 120 kilometers. For three weeks, that's 120 times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

Now, to find out how many kilometers he rode in total, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks together. So, 500 plus 360 equals 860 kilometers.

860"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my change at the store.

First, we know that Joe has 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs 40 grams. So, to find out how much all the chocolate bars weigh, we do:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams each = 1000 grams

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple. So, if a chocolate bar is 40 grams, a candied apple must be:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Joe has 80 candied apples, so to find out how much all the candied apples weigh, we do:
80 candied apples * 20 grams each = 1600 grams

Now, to find out how much the whole bag weighs, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together:
1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"Okay, let's see here. On Monday, Rose got 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she got three times that, so that's 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she got five times what she got on Tuesday, so that's 60 cakes. If we add all those up, 4 cakes on Monday, 12 cakes on Tuesday, and 60 cakes on Wednesday, that makes 76 cakes in total.

76"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how much half a dozen plates cost. Each plate costs $6000, so:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Now, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Now, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the cost of each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Sara wants to buy a jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, Sara needs $70 in total.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she still needs:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, she still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get the remaining $40, we divide:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Jerry has some red chickens and some white chickens. The red ones lay 3 eggs each day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs each day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say Jerry has \( R \) red chickens. Since he has two more white chickens, he has \( R + 2 \) white chickens.

Now, the red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so \( R \) red chickens lay \( 3R \) eggs. The white chickens lay 5 eggs each, so \( R + 2 \) white chickens lay \( 5(R + 2) \) eggs.

All these eggs add up to 42 eggs each day. So, we can write:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Let's break it down:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Okay, let's think about this. Gary walks around a park that's shaped like a rectangle. The park is 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long. To find out how far Gary walks, we need to add up all the sides of the rectangle. 

So, we have:
- Two sides that are 1.5 miles each
- Two sides that are 6 miles each

Adding these up:
- 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles = 3 miles (for the two shorter sides)
- 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles (for the two longer sides)

Now, add the total lengths of all sides:
- 3 miles + 12 miles = 15 miles

Gary walks 15 miles in total. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him, we divide the total distance by his speed:

- 15 miles ÷ 3 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. That's a lot of people!

The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, if she counted 100 on the first day, she counted:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
customers on the second day.

Now, we know that by the end of the third day, the total number of customers was 500. We need to find out how many customers came in on the third day.

We already know:
- 100 customers on the first day
- 150 customers on the second day

So, the total for the first two days is:
\[ 100 + 150 = 250 \]

To find out how many customers came in on the third day, we subtract the total for the first two days from the total for all three days:
\[ 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, we have two pools, a big one and a small one. Both pools are leaking, and they're losing 4 gallons of water every minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Four minutes ago:**
   - The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Both pools have been leaking for 4 minutes, so each has lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes).

2. **Now:**
   - The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool has \( S \) gallons of water now. Then the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons of water now.

Four minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
- The big pool had \( 4S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Okay, let's see. Lori wants to buy some fancy shoes and a belt. The shoes cost $320, and the belt is $32. So, if we add those up, it's:

\[ 320 + 32 = 352 \]

Now, she makes $8 an hour at her job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to get $352, we divide 352 by 8:

\[ 352 ÷ 8 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's see. Janeth borrowed $2000 and said she'd pay back 10% more. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. That means she needs to pay back $2000 plus $200, which is $2200.

Now, if she pays $165 every month for 12 months, that's $165 times 12, which is $1980.

So, if she needs to pay $2200 and she pays $1980, the amount left for her to pay is $2200 minus $1980, which is $220.

So, Janeth will still owe $220 after 12 months.

220"
"Okay, let's see. There are 4 roses in the vase. It says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if there are 4 roses, then there must be 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Now, to find out how many flowers there are in total, I add the roses and the dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15. So, there are 15 flowers in the vase.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 3 times 21, which is 63 years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is 2 times 21, which is 42 years old.

Now, let's see how old they will be in three years:
- Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
- Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
- Total age in three years: 24 + 66 + 45 = 135
- Average age: 135 ÷ 3 = 45

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 45."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Naomi's score**: She got 68 points.
2. **Yuri's score**: He got 10 more than half of what Naomi got. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri got 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. **Brianna's score**: She got 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna got 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up what Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna got:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

Total for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo got, we subtract the total points of the other three from 251:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Okay, let's see. Carmen takes 10 minutes for each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes for each sudoku puzzle. She did 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

3 puzzles * 10 minutes each = 30 minutes

For the sudoku puzzles:
8 puzzles * 5 minutes each = 40 minutes

Now, add the time for both:
30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, the tank starts with 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. That means:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters left in the tank.

Then, it rains, and Celine collects rainwater. She collects twice as much as what's left in the tank. So, she collects:

2 times 30 liters = 60 liters of rainwater.

Now, we add the rainwater to what's left in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters.

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

"Okay, let's see here. Carlos is paying $30 for every hour he uses the canoe. He uses it for 3 hours, so that's 30 times 3, which is 90 dollars.

Benji is paying $18 for every hour he uses the banana boat raft. He uses it for 5 hours, so that's 18 times 5, which is 90 dollars too.

Now, to find out how much they both pay together, we add Carlos's 90 dollars and Benji's 90 dollars. So, 90 plus 90 is 180 dollars.

So, they pay 180 dollars altogether."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my own cards.

First, James starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

So, he has 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards in total.

Then, he loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's count all his cards again:
- 30 fire type cards
- 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

So, he has 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards in total now.

To find the chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
- 32 water type cards / 96 total cards = 0.3333
- 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the chance is 33%.

2. He adds extra meat for $2.00.
3. He adds extra cheese for $1.00.
4. He adds avocado for $1.00.
5. He adds 2 sauces, and each sauce costs $0.25, so that's $0.50 for both.
6. He upgrades his meal for $3.00, which includes chips and a drink.

Now, let's add all these up:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.50
- Meal upgrade: $3.00

Total cost: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

"Okay, let's think about this puzzle thing. Kalinda can put 4 pieces in a minute, and her mom can do half of that, so her mom can put 2 pieces in a minute. Together, they can put 4 plus 2, which is 6 pieces in a minute.

Now, the puzzle has 360 pieces. If they can do 6 pieces in a minute, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes to do all 360 pieces. So, we divide 360 by 6, and that gives us 60 minutes.

Since 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

So, she took 36 watermelons home. That leaves:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. So:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

So, she took 63 more watermelons home. That means the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the cars alone cost:

Now, he has to pay 10% tax on the cars. So, the tax is:
10% of $240,000 = $24,000

Then, he has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car. So, the registration fees are:
12 cars * $1,000 = $12,000

Now, we add it all up:
$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

So, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.

Now, if we take away the 12 penguins that went swimming and the 12 penguins that went to eat, we need to see how many are left. 

36 penguins minus 12 that went swimming minus 12 that went to eat:
36 - 12 - 12 = 12

Together, they eat 42 plus 21, which is 63 tomatoes in a week.

Now, each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce.

So, 63 divided by 3 is 21.

Steve needs 21 vines.

Mike used to write to 5 friends, but now he only writes to 3 of them. Each of these 3 friends sends him 2 letters every week, and each letter has 5 pages. So, he gets 3 friends times 2 letters each, which is 6 letters a week. Each of these letters has 5 pages, so he gets 6 letters times 5 pages, which is 30 pages a week.

Mike writes back the same amount, so he writes 30 pages a week too. He can write a page in 6 minutes. So, for 30 pages, he spends 30 pages times 6 minutes per page, which is 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many hours that is, I know there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 180 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour is 3 hours.

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call that number \( x \).
5. Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
6. After all this, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the equation is: 9 + \( x \) - 2 = 27.

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
9 + \( x \) - 2 = 27
7 + \( x \) = 27
\( x \) = 27 - 7
\( x \) = 20

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, we got two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between these snails is 32 - 4, which is 28 snails.

Now, the problem says this difference (28 snails) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If we split the fish equally between the two aquariums, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is the same as the number of fish in one aquarium times 2.

So, if 28 snails is twice the total number of fish, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is 28 divided by 2, which is 14 fish.

Since the fish are split equally, each aquarium has 14 divided by 2, which is 7 fish.

So, each aquarium has 7 fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the makeup artist charges $250 an hour. It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup. So, for one day, it costs:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]

She needs this done 4 times a week. So, for one week, it costs:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. So, for the whole movie, it costs:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]

But the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of all the work. So, the discount is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \]

So, Jean paid:
\[ 27000 \]"
"Okay, let's see here. Isabelle spent money on different things for her sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake stuff, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. That's a lot of numbers!

First, I need to add all that up:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, the total cost is $96. Now, Isabelle and her two parents are splitting this cost three ways. To find out how much each person pays, I need to divide $96 by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32.

32"
"Okay, let's see. The chef got 4 bags of onions, and each bag is 50 pounds. So, that's 4 times 50, which is 200 pounds of onions. Now, if a pound of onions costs $1.50, then for 200 pounds, the chef would pay 200 times $1.50. That's $300.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting cookies and calories.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
   - Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 5 cookies × 4 = 20 cookies.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
   - Sue ate twice as many, so Sue ate 13 cookies × 2 = 26 cookies.

3. **Total cookies eaten:**
   - Sue: 20 cookies (Monday) + 26 cookies (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
   - Sister: 5 cookies (Monday) + 13 cookies (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

4. **Calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue's total calories: 46 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.
   - Sister's total calories: 18 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

5. **Difference in calories:**
   - Sue's calories - Sister's calories = 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 calories.

So, Sue ate 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. So, the whole school has:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ students} \]

The school is half boys and half girls, so there are:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ girls} \]
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ boys} \]

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ girls} \]

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ girls} \]

Each class has 20 students, so the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. That's 25 animals in total.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. He also killed three fewer cougars than he did last night. So, if he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, for the wolves, since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, that means he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

So, today, Rick killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves, which is 48 animals in total.

Adding the animals from both nights, Rick killed 25 animals last night and 48 animals today, which is 25 + 48 = 73 animals in total.

So, Rick killed 73 animals."
"Okay, let's see. Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor, plus 6 more floors.

"Okay, let's see here. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel. Now, 30% of 30 is 9, so Anne went down 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so that's 21 times 4, which is 84. 

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, if you count all the cows, that's 10 times 20, which is 200 cows.

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. He wants to put these new cows into 20 stalls, so he puts 2 new cows in each stall. 

Now, each stall has 20 original cows plus 2 new cows, which makes 22 cows in each stall.

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we just need to count 22 cows in each of those 8 stalls. So, 22 times 8 is 176 cows.

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176."
"Well, let's see. Brady's got a bunch of coins and dollar bills in his piggy bank. 

- He's got 100 pennies, and since 100 pennies make a dollar, that's 1 dollar.
- Then, he's got 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are 200 cents, which is 2 dollars.
- He's also got 20 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are 200 cents, which is another 2 dollars.
- Lastly, he's got 40 dollar bills, which is 40 dollars.

Now, if we add all that up: 1 dollar from the pennies, 2 dollars from the nickels, 2 dollars from the dimes, and 40 dollars from the dollar bills, that makes 45 dollars in total.

So, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how much the whole tree weighs before the termites got to it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and every 10 feet of the tree weighs 400 pounds. So, we divide 200 by 10 to find out how many 10-foot sections there are:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

That's the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of it.

Next, the termites ate 30% of the tree. To find out how much weight that is, we take 30% of 8000 pounds:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

So, the termites ate 2400 pounds of the tree. To find out how much the tree weighs now, we subtract the weight the termites ate from the original weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the tree now weighs 5600 pounds.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, Andrea has 52 apples. The problem says she has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Next, the problem says Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, he must have 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Now, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many fruits there are in total, we add up all the apples and bananas:
- Andrea's apples: 52
- Andrea's bananas: 24
- Jamal's apples: 44
- Jamal's bananas: 48

So, the total number of fruits is 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168.

"Okay, let's see. If 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies, and Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, that's a total of 66 cookies. 

To figure out how many cups of flour she needs, I'll first see how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies. That's 66 divided by 12, which is 5.5. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for each set of 12 cookies, I multiply 5.5 by 2.

So, 5.5 times 2 equals 11.

Carla will need 11 cups of flour.

Now, since 100 pennies make a dollar, I divide 6,200 by 100 to find out how many dollars that is. So, 6,200 divided by 100 is 62.

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then, we add 5 more trees to that:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Mrs. Cruz has $400,000 to spend on a house. The house she likes costs $350,000. But there are extra costs too: a brokerage fee and a transfer fee.

First, let's find out what the brokerage fee is. It's 5% of the house price:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, the transfer fee is 12% of the house price:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 350,000 \text{ (house price) } + 17,500 \text{ (brokerage fee) } + 42,000 \text{ (transfer fee) } = 409,500 \]

So, the total cost of the house is $409,500. Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the house costs, we subtract her budget from the total cost:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The house costs $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and the rest of his loan. Here's what he paid:

- Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000, which is $12,000.
- Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000, which is $20,000.
- Remaining loan: $250,000.

Now, let's add up all the money he had to pay:
$12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (remaining loan) = $282,000.

To find out how much money Mr. Tan has left after all these payments, we subtract the total amount he paid from the selling price:
$400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total payments) = $118,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. First, it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
2. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes. Adding that to 20 minutes, it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.
3. So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 28 minutes, which is 48 minutes.
4. After the oil is heated, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.
5. Finally, to find the total time from starting the oil to having the cooked chicken, we add the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken: 48 minutes + 43 minutes = 91 minutes.

So, the total time is 91 minutes."

Then, he spent 75 bucks on each TV ad, and he bought 15 of those. So, that's 75 times 15, which is 1125 dollars for all the TV ads.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the money for the newspaper ads and the TV ads together. So, 250 plus 1125 is 1375 dollars.

So, the real estate guy spent 1375 dollars on all the ads.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, let's count the windows in one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, in one house, the bedrooms have \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows.

Now, each house also has 4 extra windows that aren't in the bedrooms.
- So, in one house, the total number of windows is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

Since John has 2 houses, we need to count the windows in both houses:
- So, the total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

So, $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

She gave $20, so the change she gets back is:
$20 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the cashier gives her back $5.00."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. That's a lot of work!

Next, the collar takes a tenth of that, so it's 90 stitches. That's 900 divided by 10.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 180 stitches. That's 90 times 2.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is supposed to be 1800 stitches, so the sleeves must make up the rest:
1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve must take:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

Then, she bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, for the celery seeds, she spent 80 times 30, which is 2400 dollars.

Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together. That's 800 plus 2400, which equals 3200 dollars.

So, Mrs. Rylan used 3200 dollars to buy the seeds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting apples.

1. **Song Lines:**
   - Sean's song has 54 lines. That's easy to remember, like 54 apples.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song. So, 54 times 2 is 108 lines. But only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, 108 divided by 3 is 36 lines. That's like 36 apples for Sean.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song. So, 54 plus 6 is 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. So, 60 times 4 is 240, and 240 divided by 5 is 48 lines. That's like 48 apples for Sean.

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines. That's a lot of lines, like a big basket of 138 apples!

"Okay, let's see here. Carly had 80 cards. 

First, 2 outta every 5 cards had the letter A. So, we do 80 divided by 5, which is 16, and then 16 times 2 gives us 32 cards with A.

Now, we take away the 32 A cards from the 80, and we got 48 cards left.

Half of these 48 cards had the letter B. So, 48 divided by 2 is 24 cards with B.

Now, we take away the 24 B cards from the 48, and we got 24 cards left.

Then, 5 outta every 8 of these 24 cards had the letter C. So, we do 24 divided by 8, which is 3, and then 3 times 5 gives us 15 cards with C.

Finally, we take away the 15 C cards from the 24, and we got 9 cards left. These 9 cards must have the letter D on them.

So, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole. If he needs to dig 30 small holes, that's:
3 minutes per hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, he takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole. If he needs to dig 15 large holes, that's:
10 minutes per hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To find out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Okay, let's think about this. Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

20 (current total age) + 10 (for Mico) + 10 (for Marco) = 40

So, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 40."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now. That means if Sam is, say, 1 year old, Ruby would be 6 years old. But we don't know Sam's age yet, so let's call Sam's age ""S"" and Ruby's age ""R.""

The problem also says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, if we add 9 years to both of their ages, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age.

Let's write it down:
- Right now: Ruby's age (R) = 6 times Sam's age (S)
- In 9 years: Ruby's age (R + 9) = 3 times Sam's age (S + 9)

Now, let's use the first part:
- R = 6S

And the second part:
- R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can replace R in the second equation with 6S:
- 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's solve this step by step:
- 6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
- 3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
- 3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
- S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old right now.

"Okay, let's see. Peter bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs 25 cents. So, 20 times 25 cents is 500 cents, which is 5 dollars. He also bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs 50 cents. So, 4 times 50 cents is 200 cents, which is 2 dollars. Now, if we add 5 dollars and 2 dollars together, we get 7 dollars. So, Peter paid 7 dollars in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know a cobra has 70 spots. The problem says a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba must have half of that, which is 35 spots.

Now, there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. We need to find out how many spots all these snakes have together.

For the cobras:
40 cobras * 70 spots each = 2800 spots

For the mambas:
60 mambas * 35 spots each = 2100 spots

Now, we add the spots from the cobras and the mambas:
2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

The question asks for half the number of spots they all have combined. So, we divide 4900 by 2:
4900 / 2 = 2450

So, the answer is 2450."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we got 12 team members. Each of these team members brings 2 guests, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24 guests. We also got 3 coaches. So, the total number of people is 12 team members plus 24 guests plus 3 coaches, which is 39 people.

Now, each pizza can feed 3 people. So, we need to find out how many pizzas we need for 39 people. We divide 39 by 3, and that gives us 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15. So, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply 13 pizzas by $15, which is $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

So, Katerina makes these fancy necklaces with topaz stones. She puts 8 of these stones in each necklace, and each stone is 1 inch long. That means the topaz stones take up 8 inches of the necklace.

The whole necklace is 25 inches long. So, if 8 inches are taken by the topaz stones, the rest of the necklace, which is 25 - 8 = 17 inches, must be filled with the silver beads.

Each silver bead is a quarter of an inch long. To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, I need to divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the same as 1/4).

17 divided by 0.25 is 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 silver beads for each necklace.

68"
"Okay, let's see here. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, and then she wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 40 more. So, Alani wrote 20 + 40 = 60 stories in total.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, and then he wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 80 more. So, Braylen wrote 40 + 80 = 120 stories in total.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, and then she wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 120 more. So, Margot wrote 60 + 120 = 180 stories in total.

Now, if we add all the stories together, we get 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.

"Okay, let's see. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. A quarter is 25 cents, so 5 quarters is 125 cents. A dime is 10 cents, so 2 dimes is 20 cents. Add those up, and Kelly has 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she'll have 145 minus 55, which is 90 cents left.

90"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have a flag with 76 stars. There are three rows with 8 stars each, and two rows with 6 stars each. 

First, let's count the stars in the rows we know:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add those up:
- Total stars in the known rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

Next, we need to find out how many stars are left for the rows with 5 stars each:
- Total stars on the flag: 76
- Stars in the known rows: 36
- Stars left for the 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

Now, we need to figure out how many rows of 5 stars make up those 40 stars:
- Each row has 5 stars, so we divide 40 by 5: \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

8"
"Okay, let's see. If each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and we got 80 of 'em, we need to figure out the total weight first. So, 75 times 80 is 6000 pounds. Now, if one truck can only carry 2000 pounds, we need to see how many times 2000 goes into 6000. That's 3 times. So, we need 3 trucks to move all those flagstones.

3"
"Okay, let's think about this. The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles an hour, and the car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles an hour. If the fast car went 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it took the slow car to go the same distance.

To find out, we divide the distance by the speed. So, 480 miles divided by 30 miles an hour:

\[ 480 \div 30 = 16 \]

So, it took the slow car 16 hours to go 480 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. They have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out. So, the total number of medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we got 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 bars. So, we have:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, there are 4 adults, and each one gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the adults get:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

That means we have:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars left} \]

These 16 chocolate bars are for the 8 children. So, each child gets:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., but she takes a half-hour break. So, she works for 2 and a half hours. 

Now, 2 and a half hours is the same as 2 hours and 30 minutes. If we convert that to minutes, it's 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute chunks are in 150 minutes. That's 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 chunks.

If she earns $5 for each 10-minute chunk, then for 15 chunks, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. **First, we count how many points each friend has after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

2. **Next, we see if they get extra points in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has more than 20 points, so he gets 1 extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim has less than 20 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
   - Tony has more than 20 points, so he gets 1 extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

3. **Finally, we add up all the points:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

So, the total number of points all three friends have is:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The total points are 83."
"Okay, let's see. Will bought 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest is half that, so he's 4 and washes 4 oranges. Together, they wash 8 and 4, which is 12 oranges. So, if Will had 15 oranges and 12 got washed, that leaves 3 oranges unwashed.

"Okay, let's see here. On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's 170 exercises for the first day.

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 120 pushups. He does 10 fewer squats, so that's 40 squats. And he doubles the dumbbell presses, so that's 40 dumbbell presses. That's 200 exercises for the second day.

Now, if we add the exercises from both days, we get 170 + 200, which is 370 exercises in total.

370"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for each meal. There are 5 people in the family, so for one meal, they all together eat:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 = 1 \text{ kg of rice} \]

They eat rice twice a day, so in one day, they eat:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they eat:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

The bag of rice is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks this will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the amount they eat in a week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's see. Sam's goal was to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, 12 crates, and on Thursday, 18 crates. 

So, let's add up what he sold:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

That's 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Sam's target was 120 crates, and he sold 65 crates. So, he was short by:
120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates short of his target."

- First, someone bids $250.
- Then Carmen bids $300.
- Next, another person bids $350.
- Carmen bids $400.
- The third person bids $450.
- Finally, Carmen bids $500 and wins.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, John goes to work and comes back home every day. That's 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles a day.

He does this 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles a week.

He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles a year.

Now, he gets charged $2 for every mile. So, 15,000 miles * $2 = $30,000 for the miles.

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's $150 * 12 = $1,800 for the bonuses.

Add the cost of the miles and the bonuses together: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

$31,800"
"Okay, let's see. On Sunday, Peter did 23 minutes of exercise, and on Monday, he did 16 minutes. So, if we add those up, that's 23 plus 16, which gives us 39 minutes.

78"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math or printing. 

So, we have a 32-page newspaper. Each piece of paper, when folded, gives us 4 pages: the front and back of the folded paper. 

If we count the pages, we can see that:
- The first piece of paper has pages 1, 2, 32, and 31.
- The second piece of paper has pages 3, 4, 30, and 29.
- And so on, until we get to the last piece of paper, which has pages 15, 16, 18, and 17.

So, if each piece of paper gives us 4 pages, and we have 32 pages in total, we just need to divide 32 by 4 to find out how many pieces of paper we need.

32 divided by 4 is 8.

So, we need 8 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

"Well, let's see. Annika had 50 dollars. She spent half of it on food, so that's 25 dollars gone. Then she spent 10 more dollars on rides. So, she spent 25 plus 10, which is 35 dollars in total. If she started with 50 and spent 35, she's got 15 dollars left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know Elise's dad had 250 books. She's been selling them for three years. This year, she sold 45 books, and there are 50 books left unsold. So, the total number of books sold so far is:

250 books - 50 unsold books = 200 books sold.

Now, we know she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year. So, in the first year, she sold:

2 * 45 books = 90 books.

So far, we have:
- First year: 90 books
- Current year: 45 books
- Total sold: 200 books

To find out how many books she sold in the second year, we subtract the books sold in the first and current years from the total sold:

200 books - 90 books - 45 books = 65 books.

Each book sells for $20, so the money she made in the second year is:

65 books * $20/book = $1300.

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
1300"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. **How many days does Watson work in April?**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so he works 4 weeks * 5 days = 20 days in April.

2. **How many hours does Watson work in April?**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - So, in 20 days, he works 20 days * 10 hours/day = 200 hours.

3. **How much does Watson earn from his hourly wage?**
   - Watson earns $10 per hour.
   - So, for 200 hours, he earns 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000.

4. **How much does Watson earn from his weekly bonus?**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April, so he gets 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200 in bonuses.

5. **Total earnings for April:**
   - Watson's total earnings are his hourly wage plus his bonuses.
   - So, $2000 (hourly wage) + $1200 (bonuses) = $3200.

So, Watson made $3200 in April.

"Okay, let's see. John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. That means he beats 16 people because 80% of 20 is 16. So, if he beats 16 people, he must have lost to the rest. 

20 minus 16 is 4.

So, John lost to 4 people.

"Okay, let's see. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread every day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of them. So, two-thirds of 60 is 40 loaves. That means they have 20 loaves left for the rest of the day.

Now, they sell half of what's left in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 10 loaves. Since they sell these 10 loaves equally in the afternoon and evening, that means they sell 5 loaves in the afternoon.

So, the bakery sells 5 loaves of bread in the afternoon."
"Okay, let's think about this. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. That means Joey loses 2 pounds each week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week, so Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To lose 8 pounds, Sandy would need to lose 2 pounds four times. Since it takes her 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, it will take her 4 times 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds. 

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the ice cream:
- The ice cream used to cost $13, but now it's $11.
- So, for each tub, you save $13 - $11 = $2.
- If you buy 2 tubs, you save 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, the milk:
- Each packet of milk is now $0.5 cheaper.
- If you buy 4 packets, you save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, add up the savings:
- Savings from ice cream: $4
- Savings from milk: $2
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, you save $6 in total.

- After 6 days, 2 new arms.
- After 9 days, 3 new arms.
- After 12 days, 4 new arms.
- After 15 days, 5 new arms.

Now, let's count the legs:
- After 5 days, 1 new leg.
- After 10 days, 2 new legs.
- After 15 days, 3 new legs.

So, after 15 days, the person will have 5 new arms and 3 new legs. Add those together, and that's 8 new limbs in total.

"Okay, let's see here. Theo's got $6000 to spend on his trip. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * 100 = $600. Then he gets 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 * 50 = $150. His flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. So, 5 * 100 = $500, and $700 more makes it $1200 for the flight.

Now, let's add up what he's spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he's only got $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend. After spending $1950, he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left.

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on gifts for his business partners.

3 people * 3 eggs = 9 eggs

Then, we got the other two people who eat 2 eggs each day. So, that's:
2 people * 2 eggs = 4 eggs

Now, we add those together to see how many eggs the whole family eats in one day:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to know how many eggs they eat in a whole week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week.

1. **Cera's Age:**
   - Cera is 46 years old now.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old.
   - Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was 20 years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - If Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 26 years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population was half of what it is now.
   - So, if the population six years ago was 60,000, the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The current population of Chile is 120,000."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, we have a football team with 105 players. We know there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense, and half as many players on the special teams as on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

- The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so that's \( 2D \).
- The special teams have half as many players as the defense, so that's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Now, if we add all these players together, we get the total number of players on the team:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's add these up:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we just need to divide both sides by 7 to find \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

- 3 families with 4 people each: That's 3 times 4, which is 12 people.

So, she invited 12 plus 12, which is 24 people in total.

Now, some people couldn't come:
- 8 people were sick and couldn't make it.
- 1/4 of the sick people had other stuff to do. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2 people.

So, 8 sick people plus 2 people with other stuff, that's 10 people who couldn't come.

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we take the total number of people invited and subtract the number who couldn't come:
- 24 people invited minus 10 people who couldn't come is 14 people.

So, 14 people showed up for Martha's party."

His dad gave him 2 out of every 5 marbles that he bought from his friend. So, 2 out of 5 of 20 is 8 more marbles. Now, he has 70 plus 8, which is 78 marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so 78 marbles times 2 kgs each is 156 kgs.

So, 6 times 4 is 24, and then 24 times 5 is 120. That means the pool can hold 120 cubic feet of water.

Now, it costs 10 cents to fill each cubic foot. So, we take 120 and multiply it by 10 cents, which is the same as 0.1 dollars.

120 times 0.1 is 12.

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

- 30 boys times 3 equals 90 girls.

Next, if there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then:
- 30 boys divided by 10 equals 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add up all the boys, girls, and nongendered children:

1. At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. So, the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40.

2. After an hour, 1/4 of the people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people. That means 10 people left the party.

3. If 10 people left, then 40 - 10 = 30 people stayed at the party.

4. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. So, the rest of the people who stayed must be women. 

5. To find out how many women stayed, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed: 30 - 22 = 8.

So, 8 women are left at the party.

Now, Jam has 26 pencils, and her sister Meg has 46 pencils. If we add these together, we get:

26 + 46 = 72 pencils

Each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes we need for 72 pencils, we divide 72 by 8:

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make it:

That means 60 milliliters weaker from the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes the coffee even weaker. So, we add the 15 milliliters of cream to the 60 milliliters from the ice cubes:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Okay, let's think about this. If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, and they can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we need to figure out how many old records they brought in.

So, for each new record, they need 2 old records. If they got 7 new records, that means they must have brought in:
7 new records * 2 old records per new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. The problem says that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees:
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. If there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers, then:
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. Now, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to all junior programmers is:
   \[
   \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

4. Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so:
   \[
   \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

5. The total amount paid to all senior programmers is:
   \[
   \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. Finally, to find the total amount paid to all programmers, we add the amounts for junior and senior programmers:
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

So, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own.

So, some folks got on the bus at the start. Then, at the first stop, 5 more people hopped on. At the next stop, 7 people got off, but 8 more got on. By the time they got to the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus.

Let's break it down:
- If 7 people got off and 8 got on, that means the bus gained 1 person at the second stop.
- So, before the second stop, there must have been 19 people on the bus (because 19 + 1 = 20).
- Before the first stop, there were 14 people (because 14 + 5 = 19).

So, 14 people must have gotten on the bus at the terminal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He gives 14 to his friends, so:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
5. Adding the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night, so:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops left."
"Okay, let's think about this. If the phone is at 60% and needs to get to 100%, that means it needs 40 more percentage points to be fully charged. Now, if it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage point, then for 40 points, it would take:

40 points * 3 minutes per point = 120 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 120 minutes is the same as:

120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

2"
"Well, let's see. Erin has 7 lollipops at first. Then her mom gives her 10 more. So, that's 7 plus 10, which makes 17 lollipops. But then, she gives 3 to Ella. So, we take 3 away from 17, and that leaves Erin with 14 lollipops.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the customer spent $80 on their last trip. For every $20 they spend, they get $1 off for their next trip. So, for $80, they get:

\[ 80 \div 20 = 4 \]

That means they have 4 dollars off for their next trip.

This time, they spent $43. They used their 4 dollars off, and they also had a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, let's add up the total discount:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

So, the customer paid:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

The customer paid 31 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

**Job A:**
- They pay $15 an hour.
- I work 2000 hours a year.
- So, I make \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars a year.
- But I gotta pay 20% in taxes.
- That's \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars in taxes.
- So, after taxes, I have \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars left.

**Job B:**
- They pay $42,000 a year.
- But I gotta pay $6,000 in property tax.
- So, after property tax, I have \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- Then I gotta pay 10% in taxes on what's left.
- That's \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars in taxes.
- So, after all taxes, I have \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars left.

Now, let's see how much more I make at Job B:
- Job B: $32,400
- Job A: $24,000
- The difference is \( 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \) dollars.

So, I make $8,400 more at Job B.

8400"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know there are 220 castles in Scotland. Now, 40 percent of these castles are ruins. To find out how many that is, we can do a simple calculation:

220 castles × 40% = 220 × 0.40 = 88 ruined castles.

Next, we're told that half of these ruined castles are unmanned. So, we need to find half of 88:

88 ÷ 2 = 44.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

44"
"Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out which one costs more, the bookshelf and sofa from Furniture United or Cozy Homes.

For Furniture United:
- They want $1,350 right away.
- Then, they want 6 more payments of $350 each.
- So, 6 times $350 is $2,100.
- Add that to the first payment, $1,350 plus $2,100, and you get $3,450.

For Cozy Homes:
- They want $1,100 right away.
- Then, they want 9 more payments of $250 each.
- So, 9 times $250 is $2,250.
- Add that to the first payment, $1,100 plus $2,250, and you get $3,350.

Now, to find out the difference:
- Furniture United costs $3,450.
- Cozy Homes costs $3,350.
- The difference is $3,450 minus $3,350, which is $100.

So, Furniture United costs $100 more than Cozy Homes.

"Okay, let's see. DJ's got 8 guns, Nick's got 10, RJ's got 1, and Richard's got 5. If we put all them guns together, that's 8 plus 10 plus 1 plus 5, which makes 24 guns. Now, if they all share these guns equally, we need to split 24 guns among 4 people. So, 24 divided by 4 is 6. Each of them would have 6 guns.

"Okay, let's see. Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make one batch of suckers. If he wants to make 8 batches, he'll need 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces of sugar. For the fudge, he needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch. So, if he's making one batch of fudge, he needs 70 ounces. 

Now, to find out the total, we add the sugar for the suckers and the fudge together: 240 plus 70. That's 310 ounces of sugar.

"Okay, let's see. Maria bought 8 shares for $8 each, so she spent:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

The first year, the stock price went up by 50%, so each share is now worth:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]
So, all her shares are worth:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

The next year, the stock price went down by 25%, so each share is now worth:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]
So, all her shares are worth:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Okay, let's see. Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times as many, so that's 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so that's 3 hot dogs. Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we take John's 3 hot dogs and subtract Luke's 2 hot dogs. That gives us 1. So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Okay, let's think about this. We got 200 students, and they're split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the last one has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's say each of the two bigger groups has \( x \) students. So, the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

Now, if we add all the students together, it should equal 200:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the smallest group has:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The smallest group has 60 students.

"Okay, let's think about this. Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

First, let's figure out how many cows and chickens there are:
- If we say the number of cows is 20, then the number of chickens would be twice that, so 40 chickens.
- That adds up to 60 animals, which matches what we know.

Now, let's count the legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding them together, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

So, the total number of legs is 160."
"Well, let's see. Josh starts with 3 balls and every week he adds one more. So after 4 weeks, he's got 3 plus 4, which is 7 balls. But then he drops 3 of them on stage. That leaves him with 7 minus 3, so he's got 4 balls left. Two of the dropped balls get caught and given back to him, so that's 4 plus 2, which is 6 balls. But one ball rolls away and gets lost, so he's left with 6 minus 1. That means Josh starts juggling with 5 balls on stage.

"Okay, let's see here. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it's the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, then they all weigh 50 pounds too. The yellow snake is 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it's 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it's 30 pounds. Now, if we put all these animals in a container that weighs 20 pounds, we need to add up all their weights.

So, we have:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding them all up: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.

48 from the baby shower,
15 from her mom.

That's 24 + 48 + 15, which equals 87.

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more. So, 1/5 of 5000 meters is 1000 meters. That means Tyson should run 5000 meters plus 1000 meters, which is 6000 meters each day.

Now, June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, we just need to multiply 6000 meters by 30 days.

6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180000 meters

So, Tyson would run 180000 meters in June.

So, her son and husband together eat 20 plus 7, which is 27 cookies. 

The bag has 36 cookies, and if 27 are gone, then Jenny eats the rest. So, 36 minus 27 is 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"Okay, let's see. Davos bought 2 shirts, and each shirt costs $30. So, without any discount, he would pay 2 times $30, which is $60.

Now, there's a 40% discount. To find out how much the discount is, I need to figure out what 40% of $60 is. That's like taking 40 out of 100, so it's 40/100 times $60. That comes out to $24.

So, if the discount is $24, then Davos only has to pay $60 minus $24. That's $36.

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, when the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day. Each tractor made them $100. So, the money they made from tractors each day was:
10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000

Now, the factory makes silos. They sell 5 silos a day, and each silo makes them $220. So, the money they make from silos each day is:
5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

To find out how much more they are making now, we need to see the difference between what they make now and what they used to make:
$1100 (silos) - $1000 (tractors) = $100

Now, to find out what percentage this $100 is of the old amount ($1000), we do:
($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more money per day now.

10%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how much Madeline spends on her dog each month. 

- For food, she spends $25 a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
  - $25 x 4 = $100 a month for food.
- For treats, she spends $20 a month.
- For medicine, she spends $100 a month.

Now, let's add it all up to see how much she spends each month:
- $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 a month.

To find out how much she spends in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- $220 x 12 = $2640 a year.

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog each year.

2640"
"Okay, let's see here. Peyton has some after-work stuff to do:

- On Monday, there's a 1-hour yoga class.
- On Tuesday, there's a cooking class that's three times as long as the yoga, so that's 3 hours.
- On Wednesday, there's a cheese-tasting that's just half an hour.
- On Thursday, there's a museum tour that's half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, there are 2 hours of errands.

Now, let's add all that up:
1 hour (yoga) + 3 hours (cooking) + 0.5 hour (cheese) + 1.5 hours (museum) + 2 hours (errands) = 8 hours

So, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take 8 hours."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the school wants 30 plant pots for the daisies. That's easy to remember.

Next, they want twice as many for the roses. So, if they want 30 for the daisies, they must want:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses} \]

Now, let's add the plant pots for the daisies and the roses together:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots in total} \]

April already bought 100 plant pots. So, to find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots left over} \]

So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"Okay, let's see. Andrea had $36 at first. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. So, she spent a total of $15. If we take $15 away from $36, we get $21. So, Andrea saved $21.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

John did a bunch of stuff on his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating, and half that time, which is 3 hours, swimming. He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours of watching shows.

Now, all this time he spent on these activities is 30% of his total vacation time. So, if 15 hours is 30%, we can figure out the total time by doing a bit of math. If 15 hours is 30%, then 100% (the total time) would be:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times \frac{100}{30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

So, John's total vacation time was 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find out how much time that is, we do:

\[ 50 \text{ hours} \times 0.40 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"Okay, let's see. Annabelle wants a phone that costs 400 dollars. She already has 80 dollars saved up. 

From her first job, she makes 10 dollars an hour and works 20 hours, so that's 200 dollars. 

From her second job, she makes 5 dollars an hour and works 15 hours, so that's 75 dollars. 

Now, let's add all the money she has: 80 dollars + 200 dollars + 75 dollars = 355 dollars.

The phone costs 400 dollars, so she still needs 400 dollars - 355 dollars = 45 dollars.

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest one, so it's 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet tall.
3. Now, to find the height of the tallest tree, we need to add the heights of the first two trees together: 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.
4. The tallest tree is twice as tall as the combined height of the first two trees, so it's 2 times 17 feet = 34 feet.

So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"Okay, let's see here. Dean's mom gave him $28 to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars, and each one costs $2, so that's 6 times 2, which is $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears, and each one costs $1, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5. 

So, the total he spent is $12 for the cars plus $5 for the teddy bears, which is $17. 

He started with $28, and he spent $17, so he has $28 minus $17 left, which is $11. 

Then, his mom gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 plus $10, which is $21.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Morgan's dad gave her $90 for her birthday party. She wants to do a few things:
- Play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
- Get $5 in arcade tokens.
- Ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 each time, so that's $20 total.

So, for one person, the total cost is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $20

Add those up: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, Morgan has $90 to spend. If one person costs $30, we can see how many people can fit in that budget:
- $90 ÷ $30 = 3

This means Morgan can have 3 people in total, but one of those is her. So, the number of friends she can invite is:
- 3 - 1 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Okay, let's see. Marisa gets 5 dollars every day. She spends some of it on lollipops. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 of them. So, 4 lollipops cost 1 dollar.

If she saves 4 dollars every day for 5 days, she saves 20 dollars in total.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Billy starts with $10. He buys some candy, and then he uses half of what's left to buy gumballs. Each gumball costs 5 cents, and he buys 40 of them. So, 40 gumballs at 5 cents each is 200 cents, which is $2.

Since he used half of his change to buy the gumballs, that means he had $4 left after buying the candy (because $2 is half of $4).

So, if he started with $10 and had $4 left after buying the candy, he must have spent $6 on the candy.

The candy costs $1.50 per pound. To find out how many pounds he bought, we divide the amount he spent by the price per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's think about this. Carver just turned 45, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we add 5 to 45, we get 50. That means 50 is twice his son's age. If we split 50 in half, we get 25. So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how far the train goes in one full trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. For the trip back to the first city, it goes 50 miles less than the total of the first two legs. So, we add 75 and 100, which is 175 miles, and then subtract 50, which gives us 125 miles for the last leg.

Now, let's add up all the miles for one full trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so:
300 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total miles before service by the miles traveled per day:
18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles/day = 20 days

So, the train can go 20 days before it needs service.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to know how much stuffing goes into a collie bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. The collie bed takes the average of these two. So, we add 8 and 2, which gives us 10, and then we divide by 2 to get the average. That's 5 pounds for a collie bed.

Now, we need to figure out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds. Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds, so 4 beds would take \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.

Next, we need to figure out how much stuffing is needed for 3 collie beds. Each collie bed takes 5 pounds, so 3 beds would take \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds.

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds together. So, \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds.

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

Then, on his way back, he took a different route that was 240 miles long, and he was drivin' at 80 miles an hour. So, 240 miles divided by 80 miles an hour is 3 hours.

Add those times up, and it's 3 hours to get there and 3 hours to get back, which is 6 hours total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know there are 96 kids in the fourth grade at Small Tree School. Out of these, 43 are girls. So, to find out how many boys there are, we do:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]
So, there are 53 boys in the fourth grade.

On Friday, 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were there on Friday, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, 49 boys were at Small Tree School on Friday."
"Well, let's see. If there are 6 girls and there's twice as many boys, that means there's 12 boys. So, if you add the girls and the boys together, that's 6 plus 12, which makes 18 kids in total.

18"
"Okay, let's see. Jane needs to get at least 42 points in total from 3 tests. She got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, let's add those up:

15 + 18 = 33 points

Now, she needs to get enough points on the third test to make it up to 42 points. So, we need to figure out how many more points she needs:

42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane needs to get at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

9"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks.

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, that's:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add up all the people kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this. Erin scored 14 points and now has three times as many points as Sara, who has 8 points. So, Erin now has 24 points because 3 times 8 is 24. If Erin has 24 points now and she just scored 14 points, then before she scored those 14 points, she must have had 10 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

First, we got 44 seniors, and each one gets a picture frame that costs $20. So, we do 44 times 20, which gives us 880 dollars for all the frames.

Now, each frame needs some fancy etching, which costs an extra 20%. To find out how much that is, we take 20% of 20 dollars, which is 4 dollars. So, for 44 frames, we do 44 times 4, which gives us 176 dollars for the etching.

Next, 2 of the seniors get special pins that cost 5 dollars each. So, 2 times 5 is 10 dollars for the pins.

Then, 1 out of every 4 seniors is an officer, so we divide 44 by 4 to get 11 officers. Each officer gets cords that cost 12 dollars. So, 11 times 12 is 132 dollars for the cords.

Now, we add it all up:
- 880 dollars for the frames
- 176 dollars for the etching
- 10 dollars for the pins
- 132 dollars for the cords

880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 dollars

So, the total cost for all the senior gifts is 1198 dollars."
"Okay, let's see. If the wallpaper costs $400 and Ethan can save 20% by making it himself, that means he saves 20 out of every 100 dollars. So, 20% of 400 is:

\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \]

So, he saves $80. If he saves $80, then the cost for him to make it is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, Ethan's total cost for making the wallpaper is $320.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. That's 14 pairs.

On Saturday, they sold double what they sold on Friday. So, that's 14 pairs times 2, which is 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday. So, that's 28 pairs divided by 2, which is 14 pairs. But then, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, we take away 6 pairs from the 14 pairs sold on Sunday, which leaves us with 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

So, 14 pairs + 28 pairs + 8 pairs = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total pairs by 2:
50 pairs * 2 shoes per pair = 100 shoes.

So, the store sold 100 shoes by the end of the sale.

100"
"Well, let's see. Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesdays, 2 hours on Thursdays, and on Saturdays, she dances for twice as long as on Tuesdays, so that's 2 hours on Saturday too. 

If we add all that up: 1 hour on Tuesday, 2 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Saturday, that makes 5 hours in total.

So, Hallie dances for 5 hours a week.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, the company bought some equipment for $400,000. But 40% of that equipment was bad and they had to send it back. 

First, let's figure out how much the bad equipment cost:
- 40% of $400,000 is like saying 40 out of every 100 dollars.
- So, 40% of 400,000 is 0.40 times 400,000, which is 160,000.

Now, we need to find out how much the good equipment cost:
- The total cost was $400,000, and they sent back $160,000 worth of bad stuff.
- So, the good stuff they kept must be $400,000 minus $160,000.

Let's do the math:
- $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

So, the company spent $240,000 on the good equipment.

240000"
"Well, let's see. Mary's got 30 sheep. Half of 'em, that's 15, give her 1 kg of milk each. So, that's 15 kg of milk. The other 15 sheep give her 2 kg each, so that's 30 kg of milk. Add 'em up, and she gets 45 kg of milk every day.

"Well, let's see. Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave one to each of her 6 kids, so that's 6 rolls gone. Now, she's left with 6 rolls. She breaks each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces and gives them to the chickens. So, that's 6 times 8, which is 48 pieces. 

48"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

There are 40 kids in the class. Half of them like blue, so that's 20 kids. 

Now, we have 20 kids left. One-fourth of these 20 kids like green. One-fourth of 20 is 5, so 5 kids like green.

That leaves us with 20 - 5 = 15 kids. These 15 kids must like yellow.

So, 15 kids like the color yellow.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my apples.

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy made $56 from selling apples.
   - Each apple costs $4.
   - So, to find out how many apples she sold, I divide $56 by $4.
   - \( 56 \div 4 = 14 \) apples.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - So, \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples.

Now, let's add up all the apples she picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total apples picked:
\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked 50 apples over the three days."
"Well, let's see. Lindsay had 50 socks to wash. She washed 10 pairs, that's 20 socks, and 15 more loose socks. So, she washed 35 socks in total. If she started with 50, and washed 35, she must have missed 15 socks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done this before.

Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. This means she has to pay back the money she borrowed plus some extra money as interest.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   - The interest rate is 10%, so for every $100 borrowed, she has to pay $10 in interest.
   - For $3,650, the interest would be:
     \[
     3650 \times 0.10 = 365
     \]
   - But this is for a whole year. Since she's only borrowing for 5 months, we need to adjust this:
     \[
     \text{Interest for 5 months} = 365 \times \frac{5}{12} = 152.08
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   - The total amount she needs to pay back is the original amount plus the interest:
     \[
     3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   - She has to pay this total amount over 5 months, so:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42
     \]

So, Karan has to pay about $760.42 per month.

760.42"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour. So, we multiply 14 by 8:
\[ 14 \times 8 = 112 \]
So, Cho hiked 112 kilometers.

Next, we need to know how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour. So, we multiply 9 by 5:
\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \]
So, Chloe hiked 45 kilometers.

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 - 45 = 67 \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting our coins.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. That's 50 + 80 = 130 pesos for Axel.

Now, Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 times 50, which is 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

So, Anna has 100 silver pesos and 120 gold pesos. That's 100 + 120 = 220 pesos for Anna.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:
Axel's 130 pesos + Anna's 220 pesos = 350 pesos.

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
350"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Millie spends $18 to buy enough stuff to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher makes 12 cups, so that's:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, she sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much profit she makes. Profit is the money she makes minus the money she spent. So:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 18 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 18 \text{ dollars (profit)} \]

Millie sells 4 cups of lemonade per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we do:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ dollars (profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, Millie makes $2 in profit per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this. Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he still has 2/5 of his land left. If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, we need to figure out how much land he had at first.

To do this, we can think of it like this: if 2 parts out of 5 parts equal 12.8 hectares, then 1 part would be half of that, which is 6.4 hectares. Since the whole land is 5 parts, we multiply 6.4 by 5 to get the total land.

So, 6.4 times 5 is 32.

Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

The choir has 52 members, and half of them are boys and half are girls. So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

On the day of the performance, only the girls are supposed to sing. But half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, only half of 26 girls can make it, which is 13 girls.

Then, the 3 teachers decide to join in and sing too. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who made it.

13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

So, 16 people sang in the performance.

"Well, let's see. Wilson got these scores on his tests: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. To find out his math grade, we need to add all these numbers up and then divide by how many tests there are, which is 5.

So, 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.

Now, we divide 400 by 5, which gives us 80.

So, Wilson's math grade is 80.

David and Dasha went to the carnival, and they both want to ride all 9 rides. 

For Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- So, each ride costs 2 tickets * $2 = $4.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, she spends 9 rides * $4 = $36.

For David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, and this lets him ride all 9 rides.

Now, let's see how much David saves:
- Dasha spends $36.
- David spends $30.
- So, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6."
"Okay, let's see. Monica has to wrap 6 gifts for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That's 6 + 4 + 2, which is 12 gifts in total. She has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all these gifts. If she wants to use the same amount of ribbon for each bow, she needs to split the 144 inches evenly among the 12 gifts. So, 144 divided by 12 is 12. She can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Betty and Sam have popsicles, and the number of popsicles they have is in a ratio of 5 to 6. That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's add up the parts of the ratio: 5 parts for Betty and 6 parts for Sam, which makes 11 parts in total.

Now, if 11 parts equal 165 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles one part is by dividing 165 by 11:
\[ 165 \div 11 = 15 \]

So, each part is 15 popsicles. Now, let's figure out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Tim used to pay $60 for his cable. Now, he's getting Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus instead.

1. **Netflix:** That costs $10 a month.
2. **Hulu and Disney Plus:** Each one costs $10 a month, but he gets a 20% discount for having both. So, let's see:
   - Without the discount, both would cost $10 + $10 = $20.
   - With the 20% discount, he saves 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - So, the total for both with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add up what he pays for all the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
- Total: $10 + $16 = $26

So, Tim is now paying $26 a month for all his streaming services. 

To find out how much he saves, we subtract what he pays now from what he used to pay for cable:
- Cable: $60
- Streaming services: $26
- Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

So, Tim saves $34 a month by cancelling his cable and getting the streaming services.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. That's 4 hours.

Then, she spends half that time recording it. Half of 4 hours is 2 hours.

Next, she spends 90 minutes editing it. 

Now, let's add up all the time she spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes

To make it easier, let's convert everything to minutes:
- Writing: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Recording: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes

Total time spent:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

Now, we want to know what percentage of the total time she spent editing. We do this by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 90 minutes (editing) / 450 minutes (total) = 0.2

To get the percentage, we multiply 0.2 by 100:
0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Then, her dad gave her 2 boxes of cards, and each box had 15 cards. So, that's 15 cards in one box and 15 cards in another box, which makes 30 cards from her dad. Now, add the 20 cards she made to the 30 cards from her dad, and that's 50 cards total.

Next, Erica gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave out 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, if she started with 50 cards and gave out 29, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

But then, she got 17 cards from her family and friends. So, she adds those 17 cards to the 21 cards she has left, which makes 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"Okay, let's see. Jenny's got a pizza with 12 slices. She gives some to Bill and some to Mark, and then she eats a couple herself. We need to figure out how many slices are left.

First, Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. That's 12 slices divided by 3, so Bill gets 4 slices.

Then, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. That's 12 slices divided by 4, so Mark gets 3 slices.

Now, Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

So, we add up all the slices given away and eaten:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Now, we subtract the 9 slices from the total 12 slices:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

So, there are 3 slices left.

"Okay, let's see here. Nancy found 90 spiders in the woodshed. Now, she saw one-third as many millipedes as spiders. So, that means:

90 spiders / 3 = 30 millipedes

Next, the stink bugs. There were twice as many stink bugs as millipedes, but 12 less. So:

30 millipedes * 2 = 60
60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add them all up:

90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs

So, Nancy counted 168 bugs in total."
"Okay, let's see. If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, that means Beth is 35 years old. Now, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42 years old.

4 weeks × 6 days = 24 days

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so in a year, he works:
24 days × 12 months = 288 days

He gets paid $50 for each day he works. So, in a year, he earns:
288 days × $50 = $14,400

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, the recipe says you need 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk for one batch. But Mark is making four times that amount, so:

- For flour: 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups
- For milk: 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups

Now, flour comes in 2-cup bags, and milk comes in 2-cup bottles. So, we need to figure out how many of each Mark needs to buy:

- For flour: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
- For milk: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags:

- 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

So, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Mel uses his air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and it uses 900 watts each hour. So, if we multiply 900 watts by 8 hours, we get:
\[ 900 \times 8 = 7200 \text{ watts} \]

Now, if Mel cuts down the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will only use it for:
\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the new amount of energy used each day is:
\[ 900 \times 3 = 2700 \text{ watts} \]

The difference in energy used each day is:
\[ 7200 - 2700 = 4500 \text{ watts} \]

Since 1000 watts equal 1 kilowatt, we convert 4500 watts to kilowatts:
\[ \frac{4500}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatts} \]

If Mel saves 4.5 kilowatts each day, over 30 days, he will save:
\[ 4.5 \times 30 = 135 \text{ kilowatts} \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]
So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Next, each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So for 5 sandwiches, he needs:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's figure out the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. So:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times $7.00 \text{ per pound} = $35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times $3.00 \text{ per pound} = $15.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese:
\[ $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 \]

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Allan has 40 cannolis. The problem says he has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So now, the total number of cannolis he has is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

Now, the problem says he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has after buying more. So, he buys:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns} \]

So, the new total number of corns he has is:
\[ 80 + 60 = 140 \text{ corns} \]

Finally, we add the total number of corns and cannolis together:
\[ 140 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 240 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Okay, let's see. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already did half of that, so that's 5,000 steps, just going to and from school. Then, he walked another 1,000 steps with his friend. So, he's done 5,000 plus 1,000, which is 6,000 steps. After his jog, he still had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

So, if he had 2,000 steps left, and he needed to get to 10,000, that means he must have done 8,000 steps before and during his jog. Since he already did 6,000 steps, the jog must have been 8,000 minus 6,000, which is 2,000 steps.

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the book has 45 pages, and each page has about 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a speed of 300 words per minute. So, to read 9000 words, it will take him:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute mark, which means he has:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading in 30 minutes, he will have:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, in May:
- They hired 40 people.
- Each person worked 40 hours a week.
- They got paid $15 for each hour.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, for one person in May:
- 40 hours a week times 4 weeks is 160 hours.
- 160 hours times $15 is $2400.

For all 40 people in May:
- 40 people times $2400 is $96,000.

Now, in June:
- 1/4 of the people's contracts ended, so 3/4 stayed.
- 3/4 of 40 is 30 people.

For one person in June:
- It's the same as May, 160 hours times $15 is $2400.

For all 30 people in June:
- 30 people times $2400 is $72,000.

Adding both months together:
- $96,000 for May plus $72,000 for June is $168,000.

So, the company paid a total of $168,000 to the employees in the two months.

"Okay, let's see here. Sally's parents gave her $10 for her vacation. She bought some taffy, a bag of seashells, and some magnets.

First, the taffy. It's a deal where you buy one pound for $3 and get another pound for half off. So, the first pound is $3, and the second pound is $1.50. That's $4.50 for 2 pounds of taffy.

Then, she bought a bag of seashells for $1.50.

She also bought 4 magnets, and each one costs $0.25. So, 4 magnets cost $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total spent: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

"Okay, let's see here. Tim bought one pack of fireworks for 400 dollars. He got another pack that was twice as much, so that's 800 dollars. Together, that's 1200 dollars. But he got a 20% discount on those, so he saved 240 dollars. That means he paid 960 dollars for the fireworks packs. He also bought a finale firework for 150 dollars. So, adding that up, he spent 960 plus 150, which is 1110 dollars in total.

"Okay, let's think about this. Shannon eats 2 cookies every night. She wants to have enough cookies for 30 days. So, we need to figure out how many cookies she needs in total.

If she eats 2 cookies a night, for 30 days, that's:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time, which is a dozen. We need to find out how many dozens she needs to make to get 60 cookies.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Marcy makes 50,000 candles. She says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% might explode. 

To find out how many might explode, we take 1% of 50,000:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.01 = 500 \]
So, 500 candles might explode.

Now, out of these 500 exploding candles, 5% also smell like wet dog. To find out how many that is, we take 5% of 500:
\[ 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, each blouse usually costs $20. But they're on sale for 30% off. So, we need to find out how much 30% of $20 is.

30% of $20 is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, each blouse is $6 cheaper. Now, we subtract that from the original price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Each blouse now costs $14. Misha picked out 4 blouses, so we need to multiply the discounted price by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Joanne picks 30 apples from the tall trees. Her sister picks twice as many, so that's 60 apples.

Joanne picks 15 apples from the short trees (half of 30). Her sister picks three times as many, so that's 45 apples.

Now, Joanne also picks some apples from the average trees, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call that number \( x \).

The total number of apples picked by both of them is 500. So, we can add up all the apples they picked:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's add the numbers we know:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, we have:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from 500:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

We have a bunch of camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one hump. We know there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

First, let's think about the heads. Each animal has one head, so there are 180 animals in total. That means:
- Camels + Dromedaries = 180

Next, let's think about the humps. Camels have 2 humps, and dromedaries have 1 hump. So, the total number of humps is:
- 2 * (Number of Camels) + 1 * (Number of Dromedaries) = 304

Now, let's use some simple thinking to solve this. If all 180 animals were dromedaries, they would have 180 humps in total. But we have 304 humps, which is 124 more humps than if they were all dromedaries.

Each camel has 2 humps, so each camel adds 1 extra hump compared to a dromedary. So, the 124 extra humps must come from 124 camels.

If there are 124 camels, then the rest must be dromedaries:
- 180 - 124 = 56 dromedaries

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my steps on a long walk.

First, Tom traveled for 4 days, and each day he went 200 kilometers. So, for 4 days, that's:
200 kilometers/day × 4 days = 800 kilometers

Next, for the following 2 days, he only traveled 30% of what he did in the first 4 days. So, 30% of 800 kilometers is:
800 kilometers × 0.30 = 240 kilometers

Then, on the next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, for 7 days, that's:
300 kilometers/day × 7 days = 2100 kilometers

Now, let's add all these distances together:
800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 0 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his trip.

   \]
3. Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker. So, Timothy's locker is:

"Well, let's see. There were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and took 5 cats each. That's 4 times 5, which is 20 cats. So, 50 minus 20 is 30 cats left on the rock. Then, 3 out of every 5 of those cats ran after a mouse. So, 3 out of 5 of 30 cats is 18 cats. That means 30 minus 18 is 12 cats left on the rock.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Bill gets a deal for the first 6 months where he pays $8 each month. So, for 6 months, that's:
6 months * $8/month = $48

Next, the price goes up to $12 a month for the next 8 months. So, for those 8 months, he pays:
8 months * $12/month = $96

After that, the price goes up again to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and he's already paid for 14 months (6 + 8), he has 10 months left at the new price. So, for those 10 months, he pays:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add it all up:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

So, Bill pays $284 for 2 years of the service.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. **Tattered Jeans Cost:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Jogger Jeans Cost:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - So, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

3. **Total Savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Savings Breakdown:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars from the jogger jeans.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

5. **Original Prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

6. **Difference in Original Prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. So, for the 3 store-bought feeders:
3 feeders × 20 birds = 60 birds

The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 30 birds each. For the 3 homemade feeders:
3 feeders × 30 birds = 90 birds

Now, we add the birds from both types of feeders:
60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11

So, Aleksandra had to pay $11 for her dinner.

"Okay, let's think about this. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and he ends up with $50 extra. So, he made $150 in total from selling his Pokemon cards. He sells each card for $1.5. 

Now, if he made $150 and each card is $1.5, we can figure out how many cards he sold by dividing $150 by $1.5. That's 100 cards. But that's just the cards he sold. He kept some for himself, right? He kept 1 out of every 3 cards. So, for every 2 cards he sold, he kept 1.

If he sold 100 cards, that means he kept 50 cards (because 100 is 2/3 of the total, so 100 / 2 = 50).

So, the total number of cards he started with is 100 (sold) + 50 (kept) = 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can count and figure things out.

So, the caterer was told to make enough hot dogs for 36 people. He thought that half of those people might want two hot dogs, and the other half would just want one. 

- Half of 36 is 18, so he made 18 people's worth of two hot dogs, which is 36 hot dogs.
- The other 18 people would each get one hot dog, so that's 18 more hot dogs.
- In total, he made 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.

But then, 40 people showed up, and all of them wanted two hot dogs. 

- If each of the 40 people wants two hot dogs, that's 40 x 2 = 80 hot dogs needed.
- The caterer only made 54 hot dogs, so he's short by 80 - 54 = 26 hot dogs.

Since each person needs 2 hot dogs, and he's short by 26 hot dogs, that means 26 people didn't get their second hot dog.

So, the answer is:

5 utensils * $5 each = $25

Now, let's add up everything:
$120 (pots and pans) + $20 (mixing bowls) + $25 (utensils) = $165

The clerk says everything is 20% off. So, we need to figure out what 20% of $165 is:
20% of $165 = 0.20 * $165 = $33

   So, Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we take 75 and multiply it by 2:

   So, Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we take 150 and divide it by 5:

\[ 3 \div 4 = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

But we need to know how many pints that is. I know that 1 gallon is 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

1. George had $5 to start with.
2. He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1 cent out of every 100 cents left. So, 1% of $5 is 5 cents.
3. This means he spent $5 - 5 cents = $4.95.
4. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, 3 bags cost 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents, which is $1.20.
5. The rest of the money he spent on candy bars. So, $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
6. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so to find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide $3.75 by 75 cents. That's 375 cents / 75 cents = 5 candy bars.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, Antoine's recipe needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that. So, he uses:
- 2 pounds × 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The onions cost $2.00 a pound, so:
- 4 pounds × $2.00 = $8.00 for the onions.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so:
- 2 boxes × $2.00 = $4.00 for the beef stock.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00 total.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving:
- $12.00 ÷ 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

So, the cost per serving is $2.00.

Wayne and Bernadette are going to a movie premiere. Wayne is staying at a hotel close by, and it takes him 4 minutes to get to the theater. Bernadette is staying in her apartment, and it takes her four times as long to get there. So, if Wayne takes 4 minutes, Bernadette takes 4 times that, which is 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. So, if Wayne arrives at the theater at a certain time, Bernadette needs to be there 5 minutes before that. 

If Wayne takes 4 minutes to get there, he needs to leave 4 minutes before the time he wants to arrive. So, if he wants to arrive at the theater at, say, 7:00 PM, he needs to leave at 6:56 PM.

Bernadette needs to be there at 6:55 PM, which is 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes her 16 minutes to get there, she needs to leave 16 minutes before 6:55 PM. That means she needs to leave at 6:39 PM.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know the area of Billie's bedroom is 360 square feet. The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, 3 yards is 9 feet.

Now, to find the width, we use the area formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

To find the width, we divide 360 by 9:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack has 20 beads, so:
- 1 pack of red beads = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads = 20 beads + 20 beads = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth has:
- 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack has 20 beads, so:
- 3 packs of blue beads = 20 beads + 20 beads + 20 beads = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads = 20 beads + 20 beads + 20 beads + 20 beads = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth has:
- 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, let's see how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
- Margareth has 140 beads
- Elizabeth has 60 beads

So, Margareth has:
- 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads

80"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer. So, 3 hours times 5 degrees is 15 degrees. Add that to the starting temperature:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Now, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, which means the house cools down:

2 degrees * 3 = 6 degrees

Subtract the cooling from the temperature after baking:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

So, the final temperature in Marcus's house is 49 degrees.

49"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Jon did the triathlon in:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, for James:
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, if Jon took 40 minutes, James took 10% less time:
  40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
  80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time must be 10 minutes more than Jon's time:
170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long James took to run. We know his total time and the time he took for the swim and bike:
36 minutes (swim) + 85 minutes (bike) + run time = 180 minutes

So, the run time is:
180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes

James took 59 minutes to run.

59"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Movie C is 1.25 hours long. That's the same as 1 hour and 15 minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B is:
\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:
\[ 80 \div 4 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour. So, in half an hour, the horse runs:
- 32 miles per hour / 2 = 16 miles

Next, for every mile the horse runs, it eats half a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
- 16 miles * 1/2 bail of hay per mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3. So, 8 bails of hay will cost:
- 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which means he has:
- 6 * $5 = $30

After buying the hay, the change Michael will have is:
- $30 - $24 = $6

So, Michael will have $6 left.

"Okay, let's see. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 48 eggs, and 2 more eggs from the cupboard. So, she has 50 eggs in total. Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so she can make 10 glasses of eggnog. If each tray holds 5 glasses, then she can put out 2 trays.

"Okay, let's see here. Joey starts with 214 points and then he gets 26 more points. So, 214 plus 26 is 240 points for Joey. Now, Marcy had 225 points and she gets 10 more, so that's 225 plus 10, which makes 235 points for her. To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we take Joey's points and subtract Marcy's points. So, 240 minus 235 is 5. 

Joey is winning by 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. That means each sneaker cost him:
   \[
   \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars each}
   \]

2. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at a flash sale. So, the money he made from the flash sale is:
   \[
   17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. He had 48 sneakers to start with, and he sold 17, so he had:
   \[
   48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers left}
   \]

4. He sold the remaining 31 sneakers to a department store for $25 each. So, the money he made from the department store is:
   \[
   31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Now, let's add up all the money he made:
   \[
   340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money he made:
   \[
   1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the salesman's profit is:
\[
539

"Okay, let's see. Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons. Six of these packets had 8 crayons each, and the other four had 16 crayons each. 

First, I'll figure out how many crayons are in the six packets with 8 crayons each:
6 packets * 8 crayons = 48 crayons

Next, I'll figure out how many crayons are in the four packets with 16 crayons each:
4 packets * 16 crayons = 64 crayons

Now, I'll add these two amounts together to get the total number of crayons:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

112"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, you can get a super ticket for $20, and for just $1 more, you get a popcorn and a soda. That means the total for the super ticket with the popcorn and soda is $21.

Now, if you don't get the super ticket, you pay $12 for the movie ticket, $3 for the soda, and some amount for the popcorn. You end up saving $2 by not getting the super ticket.

So, if the super ticket with everything costs $21, and you save $2 by not getting it, then the total cost without the super ticket must be $19.

Let's break it down:
- Movie ticket: $12
- Soda: $3
- Popcorn: We need to find this

So, $12 (movie) + $3 (soda) + Popcorn = $19

That means the popcorn must cost $4.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know that 20 balloons cost $900. So, to find out how much one balloon costs, we divide $900 by 20:
\[ 900 \div 20 = 45 \]
So, one balloon costs $45.

Two days later, the price of each balloon went up by $20. So, the new price for one balloon is:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]
Now, each balloon costs $65.

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at this new price. To find out how much he has to pay, we multiply the number of balloons by the new price:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to drive but ain't no expert on math or nothing.

So, the car goes 60 miles an hour for 2 hours. That means it covers 120 miles, 'cause 60 times 2 is 120. Then, it slows down to 30 miles an hour for 1 hour, so it goes another 30 miles. 

Now, we add up all the miles the car went: 120 miles plus 30 miles, which is 150 miles total. The car was driving for 3 hours in total, 'cause 2 hours plus 1 hour is 3 hours.

To find out the average speed, we take the total miles and divide it by the total hours. So, 150 miles divided by 3 hours is 50 miles an hour.

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

50 mph"
"Okay, let's see here. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. Now, sapphires are worth $800 each, and rubies are worth $1200 each.

First, let's figure out how many sapphires she has left:
- She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has 5 sapphires left.

Next, let's find out the value of the sapphires she has left:
- 5 sapphires at $800 each is 5 * 800 = $4000.

Now, let's figure out the value of the rubies she got:
- She got 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 * 1200 = $2400.

Finally, let's add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to get the total value of all her jewels:
- $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

So, all her jewels are worth $6400."
"Okay, let's see. Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. That's 8 apples a day for both of them. If we want to know how many apples they eat in 30 days, we just multiply 8 apples by 30 days.

So, 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

240 apples"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to know how much soil each raised bed needs. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find out how much soil fits in one bed, we multiply these numbers together:

2 feet (width) × 8 feet (length) × 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

So, each bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil. Bob has 10 beds, so we multiply 32 cubic feet by 10:

32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Now, each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total cubic feet by the amount each bag holds:

320 cubic feet ÷ 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

160 bags × $12/bag = $1920

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920.

1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things out.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards. That's easy to remember.
2. **Green Cards**: It says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, if 15 is 100%, 60% more would be 15 plus 60% of 15. 
   - 60% of 15 is 9 (because 15 divided by 10 is 1.5, and 1.5 times 6 is 9).
   - So, 15 plus 9 is 24 green cards.
3. **Yellow Cards**: The yellow cards are as many as the red and green cards put together.
   - Red cards are 15, and green cards are 24.
   - So, 15 plus 24 is 39 yellow cards.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

So, there are 78 cards in total."
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, her friend saw half as many, so that's 25 more fairies. So now, there's 50 plus 25, which makes 75 fairies. But then, 30 of 'em flew away. So, if we take 30 away from 75, we got 45 fairies left.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. 

First, we add up all the puppies:
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Next, we add up all the spotted puppies:
3 + 4 = 7 spotted puppies.

Now, to find out what percentage of the puppies have spots, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100:
(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots. 

35%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a simple farmer.

First, let's add up all the feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes, each 1 pound. So, 2 pounds.
- Carrots: 4 bags, each 12 pounds. So, 4 times 12 is 48 pounds.
- Hay: 42 bales, each 75 pounds. So, 42 times 75 is 3150 pounds.
- Oats: 20 sacks, each 65 pounds. So, 20 times 65 is 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all these up:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds.

My truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, I need to figure out how many trips I need to make to carry 4500 pounds.

4500 pounds divided by 2250 pounds per trip is 2 trips.

So, I need to make 2 trips to get all the feed to my farm.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, I drink 3 aluminum cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. So, for the cans:
3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents a week from cans.

Next, I drink 5 plastic bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, for the bottles:
5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents a week from bottles.

Now, I add the money from the cans and bottles to get the total for one week:
6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents a week.

Since I want to know how much I earn in a four-week month, I multiply the weekly total by 4:
21 cents * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, in a four-week month, I earn 84 cents from recycling.

"Well, let's see. Finley started out in first place, but then she fell back 5 spots. So, she was in 6th place. Then, she moved up 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. After that, she fell back 3 spots, putting her in 7th place. Lastly, she moved up 1 spot, so she finished in 6th place.

"Okay, let's see here. Miss Maria has got six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, that's 6 times 25, which is 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, that's 5 times 40, which is 200 baseball cards.

Now, if we add the basketball cards and the baseball cards together, we get 150 plus 200, which is 350 cards in total. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students is 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students.

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Becky bought 20 apples, and each one cost 45 cents. So, 20 apples times 45 cents is 900 cents, which is the same as 9 dollars. But she got a $1 discount, so she paid 9 dollars minus 1 dollar, which is 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples too, but each one cost 50 cents. So, 20 apples times 50 cents is 1000 cents, which is 10 dollars. Kelly got a 10 percent discount. Ten percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar, so she paid 10 dollars minus 1 dollar, which is 9 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we just subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. So, 9 dollars minus 8 dollars is 1 dollar.

Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff in my head.

First, each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases (because it's twice as many as the sheets)
- 8 towels (because it's twice as many as the pillow cases)

Now, if we add all that up for one room, we get:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces of laundry per room.

If there are 80 rooms, we just multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms:
15 pieces/room × 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."

200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

But then on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we take away those:

300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"Okay, let's think about this. Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, if we count all the cupcakes she can decorate, it's 6 jars times 8 cupcakes per jar, which gives us 48 cupcakes.

Now, each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs to bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold. So, 48 cupcakes divided by 12 cupcakes per pan equals 4 pans.

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

   - So, 30 kids times 10 pencils each equals 300 pencils.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how many pencils were used after two months:**
   - The problem says 1/5 of the pencils were used.
   - 1/5 of 300 pencils is 60 pencils.
   - So, 300 pencils minus 60 pencils used equals 240 pencils left.

3. **Finally, we need to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year:**
   - The problem says only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - 1/3 of 240 pencils is 80 pencils.

So, at the end of the year, there were 80 pencils left.

- If Matt eats 2 carrot sticks, he gets 1 cookie from the carrot sticks plus 2 extra cookies, which is 3 cookies in total.
- If Matt eats 4 carrot sticks, he gets 2 cookies from the carrot sticks plus 2 extra cookies, which is 4 cookies in total.
- If Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he gets 3 cookies from the carrot sticks plus 2 extra cookies, which is 5 cookies in total.

"Okay, so let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Benny saw a big shark, and it was 10 feet long. That's pretty big! Now, there were two little fish called remoras stuck to the shark. Each of these remoras was 6 inches long. 

First, we need to figure out how long the remoras are in feet, because the shark's length is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is half a foot. 

So, each remora is half a foot long. Since there are two remoras, we add them up:
Half a foot + half a foot = 1 foot

Now, we have the shark, which is 10 feet long, and the remoras, which together are 1 foot long. To find out what part of the shark the remoras take up, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark:
1 foot / 10 feet = 0.1

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.1 * 100 = 10%

So, the remoras are 10% of the shark's body length.

"Okay, let's think about this. If three out of every four students have a desktop computer, that means one out of every four students doesn't have one. If 20 students don't have a desktop computer, then those 20 students must be the one-fourth who don't have one.

So, if 20 students are one-fourth of the total, then the total number of students must be four times 20. 

20 times 4 is 80.

Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. That's 21 days, but he can only walk 4 days a week. So, in three weeks, he can walk:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

He needs to walk for 240 minutes to break in his new shoes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he can walk:

"Okay, let's think about this. We got 32 kids in the class. Some of them are allergic to stuff. 

- 9 kids can't have dairy.
- 6 kids can't have peanuts.
- 3 kids can't have both dairy and peanuts.

Now, if we just add 9 and 6, we get 15. But wait, those 3 kids who can't have both are counted twice. So, we need to take away those 3 from 15, which gives us 12 kids who are allergic to something.

So, if 12 kids are allergic, then the rest must not be allergic to anything. 

32 kids in total minus 12 kids who are allergic gives us 20 kids who aren't allergic to anything.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the plane tickets:
- Each ticket costs $5000.
- Tom and his wife need two tickets.
- So, the total for the plane tickets is $5000 times 2, which is $10000.

Next, the hotel:
- The normal price is $1500 per day.
- But it's a busy weekend, so it's 20% more expensive.
- To find 20% of $1500, I do $1500 times 0.20, which is $300.
- So, the hotel costs $1500 plus $300, which is $1800 per day.
- They stay for 3 days, so the total for the hotel is $1800 times 3, which is $5400.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Plane tickets: $10000
- Hotel: $5400
- Total cost: $10000 plus $5400, which is $15400.

So, the trip costs $15400.

"Okay, let's see. Keegan and Tashay need to get $200 for their baseball camp. Keegan got $83 and Tashay got $91. If we add those, that's $83 plus $91, which makes $174. They need $200, so if we take what they got, $174, away from $200, they still need $26 more.

26"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs. So, Luri has:

3 times 20 = 60 songs.

Now, both players can hold up to 100 songs. So, Gabriel can add:

100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

And Luri can add:

100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract:

80 - 40 = 40 fewer songs.

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can. 

40"
"Okay, let's see. Stetson and Alec made a bet. Stetson said he'd give up $10 for each orange he eats. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

First, we need to figure out how many oranges Stetson ate. If they picked 60 oranges, and he ate 2/5 of them, we do this:
60 oranges * 2/5 = 24 oranges

Now, for each orange he ate, he gives up $10. So, if he ate 24 oranges, he gives up:
24 oranges * $10 = $240

So, Stetson gave up $240.

240"
"Okay, let's see. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her handbag cost $20 less than three times the cost of her shoes, we can figure this out. Three times the cost of her shoes is $240, and if the handbag is $20 less than that, it means the handbag costs $220.

"Well, let's see. James runs 12 miles every day, and he does this for 5 days a week. That means he runs 12 times 5, which is 60 miles in a week. Now, if he runs 10 miles in one hour, to run 60 miles, he would need to run for 6 hours. So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they get two meals a day. So, one horse eats:
5 pounds × 2 meals = 10 pounds a day.

Uncle Ben has four horses, so all together, they eat:
10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds a day.

Now, we need to know how much they eat in five days:
40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds. So, to find out how many bags we need, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per bag:
200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

4"
"Okay, let's see. Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. So, if we split 27 into three parts, each part is 9. Two parts would be 18, so 18 of the puppies are Pomeranians. Now, one third of these Pomeranians are girls. So, if we take 18 and split it into three parts, each part is 6. That means 6 of the Pomeranians are girls.

"Okay, let's see. We got three places, and we need to find the average of the highest temperatures they ever had.

Southlandia had a high of -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
Northlandia had a high of 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
Midlandia had a high of -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, I add these numbers up:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, I need to divide this by 3, because there are 3 places:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature for these three places is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

"Okay, let's think about this. Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. So, if we put 24 eggs on each tray, that's 48 eggs in total. 

Now, if Jaime has 64 eggs and he can only put 48 on the trays, that means he's got 16 eggs left over that won't fit. 

So, the answer is 16."
"Okay, let's see. Sally buys a small pizza for 8 bucks. The big family pizza costs 3 times that, so it's 24 bucks. If you add the small pizza and the big pizza together, that's 8 bucks plus 24 bucks, which makes 32 bucks in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Sale:**
   - The razors are on sale for ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means if you buy one pack, you get another pack for free.

3. **What Heather Buys:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs, but because of the sale, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - So, she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

4. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

5. **Total Razors:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack has 4 razors.
   - So, she gets 2 packs × 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is the same as 25 cents.

So, the cost of each individual razor after all the discounts is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we have 9 cheerleaders who are each 64 inches tall. The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. They are building a human pyramid with 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and the shortest girl at the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - 4 girls × 64 inches = 256 inches

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - 3 girls × 64 inches = 192 inches

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - 2 girls × 64 inches = 128 inches

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - 1 girl × 60 inches = 60 inches

Now, we add all these heights together to get the total height of the pyramid:
- 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- 636 inches ÷ 12 = 53 feet

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Charisma works 8 hours each day. Every hour, she takes a 5-minute walk. So, in one day, she takes 8 walks, and each walk is 5 minutes long.

To find out how many minutes she walks in one day, we do:
8 walks × 5 minutes per walk = 40 minutes

Now, she does this for 5 days. So, to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days, we do:
40 minutes per day × 5 days = 200 minutes

So, Charisma walks for 200 minutes in 5 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Brett is 14 years old right now. In four years, he'll be 18. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is right now. So, if Brett is 14 now, three times that is 42. That means in four years, Angela will be 42.

To find out how old Angela is right now, we need to take away those four years. So, 42 minus 4 is 38.

Angela is 38 years old right now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. 

In the morning, each ride costs him about $6. So, for 14 days, that's:
14 days * $6 = $84

In the afternoon, each ride costs him about $2. So, for 14 days, that's:
14 days * $2 = $28

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the morning and afternoon costs together:
$84 + $28 = $112

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

112"
"Okay, let's see here. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges. So, Ashley brought 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so that's 70 oranges for Brianne. Together, they have 50 oranges from Ashley and 70 oranges from Brianne, which is 120 oranges in total.

Now, if one pie needs 3 oranges, we can figure out how many pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3. So, 120 oranges divided by 3 oranges per pie equals 40 pies.

So, they can make 40 pies.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Mark has two choices for a party place. The first place costs $200 no matter how many people come, but he has to pay $5 for each person for food. The second place costs $25 for each person, and that includes the food.

We need to find out how many people need to come for both places to cost the same.

Let's break it down:

1. For the first place, if 1 person comes, it costs $200 + $5 = $205.
2. For the second place, if 1 person comes, it costs $25.

Now, let's try with more people:

- If 2 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (2 * $5) = $200 + $10 = $210
  - Second place: 2 * $25 = $50

- If 3 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (3 * $5) = $200 + $15 = $215
  - Second place: 3 * $25 = $75

- If 4 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (4 * $5) = $200 + $20 = $220
  - Second place: 4 * $25 = $100

- If 5 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (5 * $5) = $200 + $25 = $225
  - Second place: 5 * $25 = $125

- If 6 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (6 * $5) = $200 + $30 = $230
  - Second place: 6 * $25 = $150

- If 7 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (7 * $5) = $200 + $35 = $235
  - Second place: 7 * $25 = $175

- If 8 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (8 * $5) = $200 + $40 = $240
  - Second place: 8 * $25 = $200

- If 9 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (9 * $5) = $200 + $45 = $245
  - Second place: 9 * $25 = $225

- If 10 people come:
  - First place: $200 + (10 * $5) = $200 + $50 = $250
  - Second place: 10 * $25 = $250

So, when 10 people come, both places cost the same amount, which is $250.

The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own.

So, Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. 

First, let's say David found \( D \) insects. Then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, and Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects because David found half of what Bodhi found.

Now, we add them all up:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now, Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ L = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

"Okay, let's see. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. If we put these together, it's like they used 1/4 plus 1/2 of the skein. 

To add these, 1/4 is the same as 2/8, and 1/2 is the same as 4/8. So, 2/8 plus 4/8 is 6/8, which is the same as 3/4 of the skein.

Now, if a whole skein has 364 yards, then 3/4 of it would be 3/4 times 364. 

To figure this out, I can just do 364 divided by 4, which is 91, and then multiply 91 by 3, which is 273.

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape, and 1 pack of green apple. The grape pack cost $2, and the green apple pack cost half as much, so that's $1. She paid $7 in total.

Now, let's add up what we know:
- Grape pack: $2
- Green apple pack: $1
- Total cost: $7

So, the cost of the strawberry packs plus $3 (grape and green apple) should equal $7:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

To find out how much each strawberry pack costs, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
- $24 ÷ $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Now, let's see how many sticks he can get from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood:
- 6 pieces × 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Mario has 6 sled dogs. Each dog has 4 legs. So, if we count all the legs, that's 6 dogs times 4 legs each, which gives us 24 legs.

Now, each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs. So, we need to figure out how many pairs we need for 24 legs. We do this by dividing 24 legs by 2 legs per pair, which gives us 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair. That's 12 pairs times $12.00 per pair, which equals $144.00.

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Janet takes 2 bus trips every day for 5 days. So, that's 2 trips times 5 days, which equals 10 trips in a week.

Each trip costs her $2.20. So, for 10 trips, she would pay 10 times $2.20, which is $22.00.

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass, it costs $20.00. So, if she usually pays $22.00 and the pass costs $20.00, she saves $22.00 minus $20.00, which is $2.00.

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

The farm has 30 cows. That's a lot of cows!

The zoo has 20 sheep. That's a bunch of sheep!

Now, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. So if the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 60 cows. That's even more cows!

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 10 sheep. That's a few sheep!

Now, let's count all the animals:

- On the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- In the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

So, if we add them all together, we get:

40 animals on the farm + 80 animals in the zoo = 120 animals

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and she bought 4 times as many as Sophia. So, if we divide what Rose bought by 4, we can find out what Sophia bought.

For the onions:

For the potatoes:
4 potatoes ÷ 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. Adding these together, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting pennies in a jar.

First, we need to know how many days Andy has to lose the weight. From New Year's Day to his birthday on July 19th, that's:

- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Add 'em all up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Now, Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. To lose one pound, you gotta burn 3500 calories. So for 30 pounds, that's:

30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories Andy needs to cut each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

So, Andy needs to have a 525-calorie deficit each day to reach his goal.

525"
"Well, let's see. Gerald gets $30 for each day he works. He works for 7 days, so that's 7 times $30, which is $210. He spends $100, so if we take that away from what he made, $210 minus $100, he's got $110 left.

Next, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. She drinks 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer. Since she's running 2 kilometers, we multiply 60 by 2:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \, \text{milliliters} \]

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

Now, she has 500 minus 100, which is 400 left.

Then, she spent 25% of what's left on CDs. That's like taking 25 out of every 100, so for 400, it's:

400 divided by 100 is 4, and 4 times 25 is 100. So, she spent 100 on CDs.

Now, she has 400 minus 100, which is 300 left.

So, Julie has 300 left.

So, if we say the lot costs $30,000, then the house would cost three times that, which is $90,000. 

Add them up: $30,000 (lot) + $90,000 (house) = $120,000.

So, the house costs $90,000."

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She then sold each bag for $8, so for 40 bags, she made:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ali has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars in total.

Now, Ali gives half of this to his sister. Half of 160 is 80. So, Ali gives 80 dollars to his sister.

After giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of what's left to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of 80, we do:
- 80 divided by 5 is 16.
- 16 times 3 is 48.

So, Ali spends 48 dollars on dinner.

After buying dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.

So, Ali has 32 dollars after buying dinner.

"Well, let's see. Martha's makin' winter clothes for her 3 grandkids. Each one needs a hat, a scarf, a sweater, mittens, and socks. Now, to figure out how much wool she needs, we gotta add up all the wool for one kid and then multiply by 3, 'cause there's three of 'em.

For one kid:
- A hat takes 2 skeins.
- A scarf takes 4 skeins.
- A sweater takes 12 skeins.
- Mittens take 1 skein.
- Socks take 2 skeins.

So, for one kid, that's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2, which is 21 skeins.

Now, for 3 kids, we take 21 and multiply by 3, which gives us 63 skeins.

So, Martha needs 63 skeins of wool. 63"
"Okay, let's see here. Chris has 100 math problems to do. 

On Monday, he does 12 problems. So, he has:

3 * 12 = 36 problems.
Now he has:
88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of what's left. One-quarter of 52 is:

2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 5 quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks 10 quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

Now, if they started with 200 and sold 132, they have 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. But with the 6 loaves returned, they now have 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, they have 74 loaves of bread left."
"Okay, let's see here. Jackson's got 36 red tulips and he can fit 6 in a row. So, if we count how many rows of 6 we can make with 36, it's 36 divided by 6, which gives us 6 rows of red tulips.

Now, for the blue tulips, he's got 24 and he can fit 8 in a row. So, if we count how many rows of 8 we can make with 24, it's 24 divided by 8, which gives us 3 rows of blue tulips.

So, if we add the rows of red and blue tulips together, we get 6 rows of red plus 3 rows of blue, which makes 9 rows in total.

"Okay, let's think about this. Heather has a big bag of raisins, and there are 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to use these raisins to make cookies, granola, and snack mix. She's going to split the raisins equally among these three things.

So, if she splits 27 cups into 3 parts, each part will have:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, for the cookies, she needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins for each batch. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we need to figure out how many times 3/4 fits into 9.

To do this, we can think of it like this: if 1 cup is 4/4, then 9 cups is:
\[ 9 \times 4 = 36 \text{ quarters} \]

Since each batch needs 3 quarters (3/4 of a cup), we divide the total quarters by 3:
\[ 36 \div 3 = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting pennies in a jar.

First, Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity every hour. If one kilowatt costs $1.50, then:

12 kilowatts * $1.50 = $18 per hour.

Now, she wants to add a new device that uses 2 kilowatts per hour. So, the new cost per hour will be:

2 kilowatts * $1.50 = $3 per hour.

Adding this to her current cost:

$18 + $3 = $21 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how much she pays in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

Before the new device: $18 * 7 = $126 per week.
After the new device: $21 * 7 = $147 per week.

To find the difference:

$147 - $126 = $21.

So, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means it takes them 10 days to paint a whole house. Now, if we have 5 people working together, they should be able to do it a lot faster.

If one person takes 10 days, and there are 5 people, we can divide the 10 days by 5. So, 10 days divided by 5 people is 2 days. But we need to know how many hours, not days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is 2 times 24, which is 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if she has 20 sofas, she must have 22 chairs because 20 + 2 = 22.

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has 3 times 22 chairs, which is 66 chairs.

The problem also says Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 64 sofas because 66 - 2 = 64.

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

So, the total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84.
The total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88.

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172.

So, the answer is 172."
"Okay, let's think about this. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. He paid $48 in total. If we take away the $4 he spent on the CD, that leaves $44 for the headphone set. Now, if he didn't buy the headphones, he could use that $44 to buy more CDs. Each CD costs $4, so if we divide $44 by $4, we get 11. So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he didn't buy the headphones.

11"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

Josh worked out for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he did 4 hours a week. But there were some weeks where he did more.

1. For 5 weeks, he did 4 hours each week. So, that's 5 weeks times 4 hours, which is 20 hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he did 5 hours each week. So, that's 2 weeks times 5 hours, which is 10 hours.
3. For 1 week, he did 6 hours. So, that's just 6 hours.

Now, let's add all these up:
- 20 hours (from the 5 weeks)
- 10 hours (from the 2 weeks)
- 6 hours (from the 1 week)

20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours

So, Josh worked out for a total of 36 hours over the 8 weeks."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. At the start, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, 48 - 8 = 40 people are left.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. That's 5 times 8, which is 40 people. So, 40 + 40 = 80 people are now on the bus.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, 80 - 21 = 59 people are left.
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus. That means 21 divided by 3, which is 7 people. So, 59 + 7 = 66 people are now on the bus.

So, after the second stop, there are 66 people on the bus.

66"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

1. Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, right now, Jame is 27 minus 5, which is 22 years old.
2. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 plus 8, which is 30 years old.
3. The problem says that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is 30 times 2, which is 60. Five years younger than 60 is 55.
4. If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then right now, the cousin is 55 minus 8, which is 47 years old.
5. So, the difference in their ages right now is 47 minus 22, which is 25 years.

The answer is 25."
"Okay, let's see. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so that's $1,100 - $400 = $700 for the printer. Now, the computer and printer together cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. So, the 2 monitors must have cost $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. Since there are 2 monitors, one monitor costs $600 / 2 = $300.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't been to school much.

So, there were twenty kids on a school trip, and they split into two groups: boys and girls. Each group had the same number of kids. The boys went out and each of them found 60 seashells. The girls, on the other hand, found as many seashells as the boys plus four times that amount.

Now, let's break it down:

- Each boy found 60 seashells.
- Each girl found 60 seashells plus four times 60 seashells.

So, if each girl found 60 seashells plus four times 60 seashells, that means:
- Four times 60 is 240.
- So, each girl found 60 + 240, which is 300 seashells.

Each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Okay, let's see here. We got four books on a shelf, and we need to figure out how thick they all are together.

- The first book is 31 mm thick.
- The second book is 50 mm thick.
- The third book is 5 mm less than the second one, so that's 50 mm minus 5 mm, which is 45 mm.
- The fourth book is twice as thick as the first one, so that's 31 mm times 2, which is 62 mm.

Now, let's add 'em up:
- First book: 31 mm
- Second book: 50 mm
- Third book: 45 mm
- Fourth book: 62 mm

Adding them all together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

So, let's add up what she's already done:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more she needs to make, we take her goal and subtract what she's already done:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to hit her goal.

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

First, the $18 is split among 3 boys, so each one gets:
\[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]

The eldest boy gets $6. He adds $5 to it:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Next day, he adds another $10:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Then, he spends $8:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

Finally, he triples what he has left:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the eldest boy has $39 now.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so the month is split into two halves of 15 days each.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. So, if he saves a certain amount each day in the first half, he'll save double that amount each day in the second half.

Let's call the amount he saves each day in the first half ""x."" So, in the first half, he saves 15 days * x dollars per day.

In the second half, he saves 15 days * 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month is:
15x (first half) + 30x (second half) = 1125

Now, let's add those up:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

To find out what x is, we divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, in the first half, he saves $25 each day. In the second half, he saves twice that, which is:
2 * 25 = 50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"Okay, let's see. Verna bought some fruits and gave $20. We need to figure out how much change she got back.

First, let's add up what she spent:
- She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so that's 3 times $1.50, which is $4.50.
- Then, she bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so that's 5 times $0.80, which is $4.00.
- Lastly, she bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 times $0.75, which is $4.50.

Now, let's add all that up:
- $4.50 for apples + $4.00 for oranges + $4.50 for peaches = $13.00

So, she spent $13.00 in total. She gave $20, so we need to find out how much change she gets back:
- $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna got $7.00 back in change.

$7.00"
"Okay, let's see. Jairus gets 80 cents for each task, and Jenny gets 50 cents for each task. If they both do 20 tasks, we need to figure out how much more Jairus makes.

80 cents times 20 tasks is 1600 cents, which is 16 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Jenny makes:
50 cents times 20 tasks is 1000 cents, which is 10 dollars.

To find out how much more Jairus makes, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
16 dollars minus 10 dollars is 6 dollars.

So, Jairus makes 6 dollars more than Jenny.

If we split the 100 dollars into 5 parts (because 1 part for Brad and 4 parts for Jeff), each part would be 20 dollars. So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times that, which is 80 dollars.

Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Well, let's see. Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home. That's 6 miles in one day. If he does this 5 days a week, then he walks 6 miles times 5 days. That's 30 miles in a week.

Next, she writes everything she has already written again. So, she writes:
52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

Now, she writes all 65 letters again, so:

80 toys × 5 = 400 toys

Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have 400 toys. So, if he needs 2 more to get to 400, he must have:

400 toys - 2 toys = 398 toys

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's add up what Daniel wants to buy:
- He wants 5 notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. So, 5 notebooks cost 5 times $1.50, which is $7.50.
- He wants 2 pens, and each pen costs $0.25. So, 2 pens cost 2 times $0.25, which is $0.50.
- He wants 1 calculator, and it costs $12.00.
- He wants 1 geometry set, and it costs $10.00.

Now, let's add all these up:
- $7.50 for the notebooks
- $0.50 for the pens
- $12.00 for the calculator
- $10.00 for the geometry set

So, $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

The shop gives a 10% discount on everything. To find the discount, we take 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00.

- Ten packs of potato fries, and each pack is $0.30. So, 10 times $0.30 is $3.
- Five cans of fruit drinks, and each can is $2. So, 5 times $2 is $10.

Now, let's add all that up:
- $20 for the burgers, $3 for the fries, and $10 for the drinks. That's $20 + $3 + $10, which is $33.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill. So, we need to figure out how much change she gets back:
- $50 minus $33 is $17.

So, Carly gets $17 back.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. 

First, let's figure out how long that is:
- Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes.
- Then, 2 minutes more than that is 34 minutes.

So, when the water is warm, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, 3 miles would take 3 times 16 minutes, which is 48 minutes.
- In warm water, 3 miles would take 3 times 34 minutes, which is 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes in warm water, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:
- 102 minutes minus 48 minutes is 54 minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

John works 5 hours each day, and he does this for 4 days every week. So, he works:
5 hours/day × 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

He gets paid $2 for each hour he works. So, in one week, he makes:
20 hours/week × $2/hour = $40/week

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by how much he makes in a week:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes.

Now, let's count the holes. For the 7 buttons with two holes:
7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes.

For the 14 buttons with four holes:
14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes.

Now, we add up the weights of all three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."

So, the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, and that's 32 degrees up from the ground. The sun moves up 5 degrees every hour. If it moves for 10 hours, that means it goes up:

5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees

So, the sun moves up 50 degrees from where it started. Now, we need to add that to the 32 degrees it was already at:

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, after 10 hours, the sun will be 82 degrees up from the ground.

First, we got two boys. One is 12, and the other is 4 years younger, so he's 8. 

Now, we need to count how many candles we need. For the 12-year-old, we need 12 candles. For the 8-year-old, we need 8 candles. So, we need 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

The candles come in packs of 5, and each pack costs $3. To get 20 candles, we need 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

So, if each pack costs $3, and we need 4 packs, we do 4 × 3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we need to know how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read for:
15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many pages she can read in those 105 minutes. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, to find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we do:
2 pages ÷ 1.5 minutes = 1.333 pages per minute (or 4/3 pages per minute)

Now, we multiply the number of pages she reads per minute by the total minutes she read in the first week:
1.333 pages/minute × 105 minutes = 140 pages

In the second week, she read 100 pages. So, to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

So, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.

"Okay, let's see here. Richie scored 80 goals. He scored 20 more than Mark, so Mark must have scored 60 goals. Richie also scored 45 more than Anna, so Anna must have scored 35 goals. If we add all their goals together, that's 80 for Richie, 60 for Mark, and 35 for Anna. So, 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals in total.

175"
"Well, let's see. Liam said he made $63. Mitchell said he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, if you do the math, 21 times 4 is 84. That means Mitchell made $84. Now, to find out how much more Mitchell made, we take 84 and subtract 63. That's 21. So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

21"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Peter has $70 to spend over a week. He wants to spend the same amount each day. 

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. That's 4 days. So, he spends:
4 days * $5/day = $20 on wooden action figures.

Now, let's see how many wooden action figures he gets:
$20 / $5 per figure = 4 wooden action figures.

After spending $20, he has:
$70 - $20 = $50 left.

From Thursday to Saturday, he buys plastic action figures that cost $2 each. That's 3 days. So, he spends:
3 days * $2/day = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's see how many plastic action figures he gets:
$6 / $2 per figure = 3 plastic action figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter has:
4 wooden action figures + 3 plastic action figures = 7 action figures.

That's it! Peter will have 7 action figures by the end of the week.

"Well, lemme see now. The spaying cost 200 dollars. The kitten got 3 shots, and each shot was 20 dollars, so that's 60 dollars for all the shots. Then, the little furball broke 4 vases, and each vase was 12 dollars, so that's 48 dollars for the vases. Now, let's add all that up:

200 dollars for the spaying,
60 dollars for the shots,
48 dollars for the vases.

200 + 60 + 48 = 308 dollars.

So, the kitten has cost 308 dollars so far.

308"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my chickens.

First, let's see how many roses Ford grows in a month. He grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's add up how many roses the flower shops want in a month. The first shop wants 20 roses a week, the second wants 15, and the third wants 30. So, in one week, they want:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

For a month, that's:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, if Ford can only grow 160 roses a month, but the shops want 260, he's short by:
260 - 160 = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so:
2 years × 12 months/year = 24 months

Next, Katina takes out $100 every month. So, over 24 months, she takes out:
24 months × $100/month = $2400

Now, we need to see how much money she has left after taking out $2400 from her initial $3000. So:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

600"
"Okay, let's see here. The food truck sells grilled cheese sandwiches. They buy bread for $3.00 a loaf, and one loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the bread for 10 sandwiches costs $3.00. They also spend $30.00 on cheese and other stuff for 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 for the bread plus $30.00 for the cheese and other stuff, which is $33.00.

Now, they sell each sandwich for $7.00. So, for 10 sandwiches, they make 10 times $7.00, which is $70.00.

To find out how much they make after all the costs, we take the money they make from selling the sandwiches and subtract the cost of making them. So, $70.00 minus $33.00 is $37.00.

So, the net profit is $37.00.

37"
"Well, let's see. Kate got 3 boxes of crayons, and each box had 64 crayons. So, she had:

3 boxes times 64 crayons in each box, which is 192 crayons.

Now, she makes crayon muffins by melting 8 crayons together. So, we need to figure out how many muffins she can make:

192 crayons divided by 8 crayons per muffin, which gives us 24 muffins.

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, then:

24 muffins times $1.50 each, which is $36.

So, Kate can make $36.

36"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how big the room is. The room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide. To find out how many square feet that is, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's break down the costs:

1. **New Carpet:**
   The new carpet costs $12 per square foot. So for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 12 = 2,592 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Padding:**
   The padding costs $2 per square foot. So for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 2 = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Removing Old Carpet:**
   The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. So for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 4 = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Installing New Carpet:**
   The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. So for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 34 = 7,344 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total:
\[ 2,592 + 432 + 864 + 7,344 = 11,232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ 11,232 \]"
"Well, let's see. Mack counted birds for a whole week. Here's what he saw:

- On the first two days, he saw 50 birds in total.
- On the third day, he didn't see any birds.
- On the fourth and fifth days, he saw 120 birds in total.
- On the sixth day, he saw 20 birds.
- On the seventh day, he saw 90 birds.

Now, to find out how many birds he saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds and then divide by the number of days.

So, 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds in total.

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 280 by 7:

280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds each day.

40"
"Okay, let's see here. Diane started with 20. She added half of 20, which is 10, to the 20, making it 30. Then, she divided 30 by 5, which gives 6. After that, she took the 20 and subtracted 12, which is 8. Finally, she multiplied 6 by 8, and that gives 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"Well, let's see. The boy got 5 cards. His brother has 3 less, so that means his brother has 2 cards. If we put their cards together, that's 5 and 2, which makes 7 cards in total.

"Okay, so Maggie's oven is a bit wonky. When she sets it to 450, it actually gets to 468. That's 18 degrees too hot. 

Now, if she needs it to be 520 degrees, we need to figure out what to set it to so it doesn't go over by the same amount. 

If 450 goes to 468, that's about 4% too hot. So, we need to set it a bit lower than 520 to make up for that extra heat. 

To find out what to set it to, we can do a bit of math. If 520 is 104% of what we need to set it to, then we can figure out what 100% (the right setting) is by dividing 520 by 1.04.

So, 520 divided by 1.04 is about 500.

Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to 520.

500"
"Well, let's see. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. That's 90 minutes, 'cause 1 hour is 60 minutes, and 60 plus 30 is 90. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. That's 125 minutes, 'cause 2 hours is 120 minutes, and 120 plus 5 is 125. Now, if you add 90 and 125 together, you get 215 minutes. So, Max will spend 215 minutes watching the two movies.

215"
"Well, let's see. Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less than that. 

First, I need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is. That's like taking 30 out of 100 parts of $76,000. So, I do:
\[ 76,000 \times 0.30 = 22,800 \]

Now, I subtract that from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. To find the total value of both houses, I add them together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The total value of both houses is $129,200."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Judy bought 12 cups, that's a dozen. She also got twice as many dishes, so that's 24 dishes. 

Her friend brought 40 cups, which is a lot more than Judy. And her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 dishes plus 20 more, which is 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the stuff they brought:
- Judy's cups: 12
- Judy's dishes: 24
- Friend's cups: 40
- Friend's dishes: 44

So, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Adding the cups and dishes together, we get 52 + 68 = 120 utensils.

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, I know that 1 box of contacts costs $100.00, but there's a 10% discount. So, the discount on one box is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Pete uses 2 contacts a day, so the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

To find out how much each pair of contacts costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, each pair of contacts costs:
\[ 2.00 \]

2.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, they both get paid $10 for each hour they work.

Jill's pay:
- 3 hours * $10 = $30

John's pay:
- 7 hours * $10 = $70

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill:
- $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's see. Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours, and that burns 500 calories each hour. So, 2 hours times 500 calories is 1000 calories. Then, she runs for 1 hour, which burns 600 calories. So, 1000 calories from aerobics plus 600 calories from running makes 1600 calories in total.

Now, for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 100 ml of water. So, we need to figure out how many 200s are in 1600. That's 1600 divided by 200, which is 8. Since each 200 calories means 100 ml of water, she needs 8 times 100 ml, which is 800 ml of water.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water. 

800"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

So, we have a big jar with red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.

First, let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

- The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than \( B \), so it's \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than \( B \), so it's \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

Now, we add them all up:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

So, \( B = 4500 / 3 = 1500 \).

Now we know:
- Blue jelly beans: 1500
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's see. Jared starts at 47 words a minute. Then he gets better and goes up to 52 words a minute. If he gets even better and goes up by 5 more words, he'll be at 57 words a minute.

Now, to find the average, we add all three numbers together and then divide by 3, because there are three numbers.

So, 47 plus 52 plus 57 is 156. Now, 156 divided by 3 is 52.

So, the average of the three measurements is 52.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would lose:
1.25 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would gain:
1.75 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find out the difference in his weight between the two options, we add the weight he would lose to the weight he would gain:
6.25 pounds + 8.75 pounds = 15 pounds

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 15 pounds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. Alex invites 100 people by email. Each of these 100 people says they will bring 2 friends. So, for each person, there are 2 more people coming. That means:
   - 100 people + (100 people * 2 friends each) = 100 + 200 = 300 people from the email invitations.

2. Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends. Out of these 10 friends, 8 say they will bring their spouses. So, for each of these 8 friends, there is 1 more person coming. That means:
   - 10 friends + (8 friends * 1 spouse each) = 10 + 8 = 18 people from the phone calls.

3. Now, we add the people from the email invitations and the phone calls together:
   - 300 people from the email invitations + 18 people from the phone calls = 318 people in total.

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The third dog, the Papillon, weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The fourth dog, the Mastiff, weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs:
   \[
   5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds}

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, let's look at the cost of the boots on Amazon:
- The boots cost $16.
- The shipping costs $4.
- So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Now, let's look at the cost of the boots on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so that's $4 * 2 = $8.
- So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"Well, let's see. Mark's beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall, and it doubles every day. His window is 20 feet up. We need to figure out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than that.

- On the first day, it's 4 feet times 2, so it's 8 feet.
- On the second day, it's 8 feet times 2, so it's 16 feet.
- On the third day, it's 16 feet times 2, so it's 32 feet.

So, on the third day, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window. It takes 3 days.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

If a cup of mushrooms, which is 100 grams, has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms would have twice as much protein, right? So, 200 grams of mushrooms would have 6 grams of protein.

Now, if John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein each day. There are 7 days in a week, so if he eats 6 grams of protein each day for 7 days, he would get:

6 grams/day × 7 days = 42 grams of protein in a week.

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms. 

42"
"Okay, let's think about this. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we need to figure out his current age first.

Let's say Jerry is \( J \) years old now. Five years ago, he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice what he was 5 years ago, so:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is 10 years old right now. In 3 years, he will be:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, George needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. So, for 2 implants, that's:
\[ 2000 \times 2 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, one of those implants needs a fancy porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, we add that to the total:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the amount he still needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George makes $15 per hour at his job. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out. We got a triangle, and the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees. One angle is the smallest, let's call it a little angle. Another angle is twice as big as the little one, and the last one is three times as big as the little one.

So, if the little angle is, say, \( x \) degrees, then the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees. All these angles together make 180 degrees. So, we can write it like this:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

That's the same as:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Now, to find \( x \), we divide 180 by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the little angle is 30 degrees. The biggest angle, which is three times the little one, is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the biggest angle is 90 degrees."
"Okay, let's see here. Colby's got some coins, and he wants to buy gumballs that cost a nickel each. 

First, let's count up all his money:
- He's got 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 8 times 25, which is 200 cents.
- Then he's got 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 6 times 10, which is 60 cents.
- He's also got 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 14 times 5, which is 70 cents.
- Lastly, he's got 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent, so that's 15 cents.

Now, let's add all that up:
- 200 cents from the quarters
- 60 cents from the dimes
- 70 cents from the nickels
- 15 cents from the pennies

That's a total of 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy:
- 345 ÷ 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. We got 5 dogs, and each dog got 4 legs. So, that's 20 legs from the dogs. Then, we got 2 cats, and each cat also got 4 legs. So, that's 8 legs from the cats. Lastly, we got 10 birds, and each bird got 2 legs. So, that's 20 legs from the birds. Now, if we add all them legs up, we get 20 legs from the dogs, 8 legs from the cats, and 20 legs from the birds. That makes 48 legs in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. Steve gets 5 games for his birthday. So, he starts with 5 games.
2. In the first year, he buys 1 game every month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys 12 games.
3. In the second year, he buys 2 games every month. So, he buys 24 games in that year.
4. In the third year, he buys 4 games every month. So, he buys 48 games in that year.
5. Every Christmas, he gets 5 more games. He gets these for 3 years, so that's 15 more games.

Now, let's add all these up:
- 5 games from his birthday
- 12 games from the first year
- 24 games from the second year
- 48 games from the third year
- 15 games from Christmas

So, 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104

Steve has 104 games after 3 years."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, a plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That means it goes 400 miles every hour, right? Because 1200 divided by 3 is 400.

Now, if I want to know how long it takes to go 2000 more miles, I just need to figure out how many times 400 goes into 2000. 

If I count it out:
- 400 miles is 1 hour
- 800 miles is 2 hours
- 1200 miles is 3 hours
- 1600 miles is 4 hours
- 2000 miles is 5 hours

So, it would take 5 more hours to go 2000 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. So, in one hour, Ruiz makes half of that, which is 60 pounds.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes 3/4 of 120 pounds in one hour. That's 90 pounds.

If they both work for 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 pounds per hour times 12 hours, which is 720 pounds. Marissa will make 90 pounds per hour times 12 hours, which is 1080 pounds.

Adding those together, 720 pounds plus 1080 pounds equals 1800 pounds.

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

$92 - $16 = $76 left.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so that's:
4 * $16 = $64.
Now he has:
$76 - $64 = $12 left.

So, Howard has $12 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Patrick sold lemonade for 4 hours. He sold 15 cups each hour, and each cup was 50 cents. So, for one hour, he made:
15 cups * 50 cents = 750 cents, which is the same as 7.50 dollars.

For 4 hours, he made:
7.50 dollars * 4 = 30 dollars.

Then, for the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups each hour, and each cup was 60 cents. So, for one hour, he made:
10 cups * 60 cents = 600 cents, which is the same as 6 dollars.

For 2 hours, he made:
6 dollars * 2 = 12 dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he made:
30 dollars + 12 dollars = 42 dollars.

So, Patrick made 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know that every 2 miles, the tires on Jeremy's car rotate 725 times. So, if Jeremy drives 400 miles in a month, we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate in that month.

To do this, we divide 400 miles by 2 miles to find out how many 2-mile segments there are in 400 miles:
\[ 400 \div 2 = 200 \]

So, there are 200 segments of 2 miles in 400 miles. Since the tires rotate 725 times for each 2-mile segment, we multiply 200 by 725 to find the total number of rotations in a month:
\[ 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:
\[ 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

The tires can handle 10,440,000 rotations before they need to be replaced. To find out how many years it will take to reach this number, we divide the total number of rotations the tires can handle by the number of rotations they make in a year:
\[ 10,440,000 \div 1,740,000 = 6 \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Okay, let's think about this. If the big bottle of shampoo costs $24 and it says to use 2 pumps for each wash, that means you can get 120 washes. But if Jackie only uses 1 pump for each wash, she can get twice as many washes, so that's 240 washes.

Now, to find out how much each pump costs, we take the total cost of the bottle and divide it by the number of pumps. So, $24 divided by 240 pumps. That's 2400 cents (since $1 is 100 cents) divided by 240 pumps.

2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Okay, let's see. Joe has $50 to spend. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. That's $60 in total, but there's a 30% off sale. 

So, 30% off means he only pays 70% of the price. To find 70% of $60, I do this: 60 times 0.70, which is $42.

Joe has $50, and he spends $42, so he has $50 minus $42 left. That's $8.

Joe will have $8 left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. If he wants to make 4 dozen croissants, he needs 4 times that amount of butter. So, 4 times 1/4 pound is 1 pound of butter for 4 dozen croissants.

Now, if he wants to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week, that's 7 days. So, he needs 1 pound of butter each day for 7 days. That means he needs 7 pounds of butter in total.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to know how much it costs to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter. So, we do the math:
150 meters * $194 per meter = $29,100

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter. So, we do the math again:
490 meters * $194 per meter = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

65960"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done math like this before.

First, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. That means each month he gets $100,000 divided by 5, which is $20,000 per month.

Now, his research takes 10 times longer than those first 5 months. So, 5 months times 10 is 50 months in total.

He already used 5 months, so he has 50 - 5 = 45 more months to go.

For these extra months, he needs 50% more money each month. So, if he was getting $20,000 per month, now he gets $20,000 plus half of $20,000, which is $10,000. So, he gets $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 per month for the extra 45 months.

Now, let's add it all up:
- For the first 5 months, he spent $100,000.
- For the next 45 months, he spent $30,000 per month, which is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

So, the total cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"Okay, let's see here. The first player had a 6-ounce steak. The second player had 8 beef tips, and each one was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player had a one-pound steak, and since 1 pound is 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces. The other two players didn't eat any meat 'cause they had vegetarian meals.

So, we add 'em up:
6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces

The team ate 30 ounces of meat in total.

"Okay, let's see. If there are 1000 people in the group and each one of them posts 3 times a day, that means every day there are 3000 posts. Now, March has 31 days, so if we multiply 3000 posts a day by 31 days, we get 93,000 posts for the whole month.

93000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. That means he does:
\[ 2 \text{ times a week} \times 52 \text{ weeks in a year} = 104 \text{ times a year} \]

Each time he does laundry, he uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water he uses in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ times a year} \times 20 \text{ gallons each time} = 2080 \text{ gallons a year} \]

Now, water costs 15 cents per gallon. To find out how much he spends, we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"Well, lemme see here. Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then she went to the pet store and bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's $5.00. She also got 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each, which adds up to $6.00. She bought 20 fish, and each one cost $0.50, so that's $10.00. Lastly, she needed fish food for $2.00. 

Now, let's add it all up:
- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total.

"Well, let's see. The beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. Then it doubled, so that's 3 times 2, which makes it 6 inches tall after the second week. Then it grew another 4 inches in the third week, so 6 plus 4 is 10 inches. So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour, and he works for 10 hours each day. So, in one day, he sells:

15 kg/hour × 10 hours = 150 kg/day

Now, the bull that Bill gave him weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat he sells in a day:

750 kg ÷ 150 kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, the auditorium has 4 rows, and each row has 18 seats. So, if we count all the seats, it's:
4 rows times 18 seats = 72 seats in total.

Now, one-fourth of these seats were taken by the administrators. One-fourth of 72 is:
72 divided by 4 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were taken by the administrators. That leaves us with:
72 seats minus 18 seats = 54 seats left.

Next, one-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. One-third of 54 is:
54 divided by 3 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were taken by the parents. That leaves us with:
54 seats minus 18 seats = 36 seats.

These 36 seats were taken by the students. So, the number of students in the auditorium is 36.

36"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how many street lights are at one intersection. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, we do:
\[ 4 \text{ street lights per pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \]

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are on the whole road. There are 4 intersections, so:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights in total} \]

But we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. So, we need to subtract those from the total:
\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ non-working street lights} = 76 \text{ working street lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's see. We got two DVDs, and each can be played 1000 times before they break. One DVD has been played 356 times, and the other has been played 135 times. 

To find out how many more times they can be played, we need to figure out how many plays are left for each one. 

For the first DVD:
1000 - 356 = 644 plays left.

For the second DVD:
1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, to find the total number of plays left for both DVDs, we add the plays left for each:
644 + 865 = 1509 plays.

So, both DVDs can be played 1509 more times before they break.

1509"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice, so that's 6 weeks times 2 visits each week, which gives us 12 visits in total.

Each visit, he spent 2 hours. So, 12 visits times 2 hours each visit, that's 24 hours in total.

Now, each hour costs $125. So, 24 hours times $125 per hour, that's 24 times 125.

To make it easier, let's break it down:
- 24 times 100 is 2400.
- 24 times 25 is 600 (because 25 is a quarter of 100, and a quarter of 2400 is 600).

So, 2400 plus 600 is 3000.

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. 

He chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school, and school lasts 8 hours. So, he chews:
- 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's:
- 4 pieces + 1 piece + 1 piece = 6 pieces in total.

Now, he started with 20 pieces, and he chewed 6 pieces, so he has:
- 20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces left.

Then, he gives half of what's left to his sister. So, he gives away:
- 14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, at the end of the day, Jim has:
- 14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces left.

"Well, let's see. If Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years, that means right now she's 4 years old. If we want to know how old she'll be in 4 years, we just add 4 to her current age. So, 4 plus 4 is 8. 

Charmaine will be 8 years old in 4 years.

"Well, lemme think 'bout this. The baseball coach, he bought 9 baseballs, and each one cost him $3. So, that's 9 times 3, which is $27. The basketball coach, he got 8 basketballs, and each one of those was $14. So, that's 8 times 14, which is $112. Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we take 112 and subtract 27. That's $85 more.

Now, it says that only 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed. So, if we split 200 flowers into 5 equal parts, each part would have 40 flowers. Since 4 parts have bloomed, that's 4 times 40, which is 160 flowers.

So, 160 flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done this before.

First, we need to know how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour

Now, Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobytes (kb) per second. To find out how many kilobytes she can download in an hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Next, we need to convert kilobytes to megabytes. There are 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte, so:
72000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, that's 10 cars times 3 days, which gives us 30 cars.

For the next four days, the truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day. So, it pulled 6 cars each day for those four days. That's 6 cars times 4 days, which gives us 24 cars.

Now, if we add the cars from the first three days and the next four days, we get 30 cars plus 24 cars, which equals 54 cars.

So, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how tall Adam needs to be to ride the roller coaster. The park says you gotta be 4 feet tall. Now, 4 feet is the same as 48 inches, 'cause there are 12 inches in a foot.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall. So, we need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to be 48 inches tall. 

48 inches (how tall he needs to be) minus 40 inches (how tall he is now) equals 8 inches. So, Adam needs to grow 8 more inches.

Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide 8 inches by 2 inches per year.

8 inches divided by 2 inches per year equals 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Okay, let's see here. James sold 10 cars, and each car was $25,000. So, he made 10 times $25,000, which is $250,000 from selling the cars.

Now, the company had to pay 30% of the price to get the cars. So, for each car, that's 30% of $25,000, which is $7,500. For 10 cars, that's 10 times $7,500, which is $75,000.

So, the company's profit is the total sales minus what they paid for the cars. That's $250,000 minus $75,000, which is $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, 10% of $175,000 is $17,500.

James made $17,500.

Now, out of these 25 surfers, 60% are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

1. **Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. That's easy to remember.

2. **Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 of the price of a diamond Jewell. So, we need to find 4/5 of $2000.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
   So, the gold Jewell costs $1600.

3. **Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
   So, the silver Jewell costs $1200.

4. **Total Price:**
   Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels.

Next, he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, if he bought 16 snowflakes, he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Then, he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, if he bought 19 truck stamps, he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add them all up:
- 16 snowflake stamps
- 19 truck stamps
- 10 rose stamps

16 + 19 + 10 = 45

So, Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own. So, Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. 

To catch up, Tom needs to make up the 75 miles. The difference in their speeds is 70 minus 55, which is 15 miles per hour. This means Tom is getting closer to Bob by 15 miles every hour.

Now, to find out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the speed difference:
75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour equals 5 hours.

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math.

Manny's parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 each. The total cost for all the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny goes to all 10 classes, each class costs:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

But if he misses some classes, the cost per class goes up. We need to figure out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class hits $10.

Let's try it step by step:

- If he misses 1 class, he goes to 9 classes:
  \[ \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \text{ dollars per class} \]
- If he misses 2 classes, he goes to 8 classes:
  \[ \frac{60}{8} = 7.50 \text{ dollars per class} \]
- If he misses 3 classes, he goes to 7 classes:
  \[ \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ dollars per class} \]
- If he misses 4 classes, he goes to 6 classes:
  \[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars per class} \]
- If he misses 5 classes, he goes to 5 classes:
  \[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ dollars per class} \]

So, if Manny misses 5 classes, the cost per class goes over $10. But if he misses 4 classes, the cost per class is exactly $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

First, we need to know how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to know how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges will cost. 

For 5 apples:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

For 5 oranges:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of the apples and the oranges together:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet = 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Now, Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of dirt. So, to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply 72 by 3:

72 × 3 = 216 seconds.

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just adding up some numbers.

First, the truck itself costs $30,000. That's the base price.

Then, Bill wants a king cab, which adds $7,500 to the price.

Next, he wants leather seats. The leather seats cost one-third of what the king cab costs. So, that's $7,500 divided by 3, which is $2,500.

Bill also wants running boards. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. So, that's $2,500 minus $500, which is $2,000.

Lastly, he wants the upgraded exterior light package, which costs $1,500.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

So, $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **Tim's current salary:** $20,000 a month.
2. **5% raise:** That means he gets an extra 5% of $20,000. So, 5% of $20,000 is $1,000.
3. **New monthly salary:** $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.
4. **Bonus:** The bonus is half a month's new salary. So, half of $21,000 is $10,500.
5. **Annual salary without bonus:** $21,000 per month times 12 months = $252,000.
6. **Total annual earnings with bonus:** $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, James buys 10 suits. Each suit costs $750. So, the total for the suits is:
10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

Next, he buys 10 dress pants. Each pair of pants costs 1/5 of a suit, so:
$750 / 5 = $150 per pair of pants
10 pairs * $150/pair = $1500

Then, he buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. He has 10 suits, so:
10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts
Each shirt costs $60, so:
30 shirts * $60/shirt = $1800

Now, let's add it all up:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (pants) + $1800 (shirts) = $10800

So, the total cost of everything is $10800.

10800"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

First, the news website puts out 20 articles every day. That's like 20 marbles in a jar each day. If we do this for 28 days, we get:
20 marbles/day × 28 days = 560 marbles (or articles).

Next, the sister company puts out 10 articles every day. That's like 10 marbles in another jar each day. If we do this for 28 days, we get:
10 marbles/day × 28 days = 280 marbles (or articles).

Now, we need to add the marbles from both jars together to see how many we have in total:
560 marbles + 280 marbles = 840 marbles (or articles).

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:
840"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she's 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so he's 32 years old.
4. The son's wife is 3 years younger than the son, so she's 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

29"
"Okay, let's think about this. If one bag of flour is split into 8 parts, and each part is 2 kilograms, then one bag must have 16 kilograms of flour, because 8 times 2 is 16. Now, if we have three bags, we just need to multiply 16 by 3. So, 16 times 3 is 48. 

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms. 

48"
"Well, let's see. Alisa biked for 4 and a half hours at 12 miles an hour. So, that's 12 times 4.5, which is 54 miles. Stanley biked for 2 and a half hours at 10 miles an hour. So, that's 10 times 2.5, which is 25 miles. If we add those together, 54 plus 25, we get 79 miles. So, they biked a total of 79 miles. 

79"
"Well, let's see. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil in one hour. He's got 24 feet of soil to dig through, so that's 24 divided by 4, which is 6 hours for the soil. Now, for the clay, he can only dig half as fast, so that's 2 feet per hour. He's got 8 feet of clay, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 hours for the clay. Add those together, 6 hours for the soil and 4 hours for the clay, and that's 10 hours total. So, it'll take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Well, let's see. Howie wants to give cupcakes to his teacher, himself, and 25 classmates. That's 27 people in total. Each person gets 2 cupcakes, one vanilla and one chocolate. So, we need to figure out how many cupcakes that is.

If each of the 27 people gets 2 cupcakes, we just need to multiply 27 by 2. 

27 times 2 is 54.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie after one week. Three weeks later, she had 70 times that many likes. So, we do the math:

2000 likes times 70 = 140,000 likes.

Then, she got 20,000 more likes recently. So, we add those:

140,000 likes + 20,000 likes = 160,000 likes.

So, Fishio has 160,000 likes on her selfie now.

160000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost before any discounts is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate went up to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so the total cost before any discounts is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

After applying the discount, the final amount Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, to find the difference between what Clara paid and what Sheila paid, we subtract Clara's total from Sheila's total:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
142"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Ariadne sells red and green hats. She made $400 from red hats in one month. The green hats? Well, she made twice as much from those. So, if red hats brought in $400, green hats must have brought in $800.

Now, to find out how much she made in total for that month, we add the red and green hat sales:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

So, in the first month, she made $1200.

In the second month, she made \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month. To find that, we take \(\frac{3}{4}\) of $1200:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

So, in the second month, she made $900.

To find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the sales from both months:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount she made in two months is:
\[ 2100 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

James hired a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. That's 4 hours total. But he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. That's easy to remember.

The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour. So, that's $15 times 2, which is $30.

The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour. So, that's $30 times 2, which is $60.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

So, $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

James paid $105.

"Okay, let's see. Sally had $200 in her bank at the start. Now she has $420. That means she got $220 more in her bank. But she should have got $300 for her work this week. So, someone took away $300 - $220, which is $80 from what she should have got.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, each guest is gonna eat 3 deviled egg halves. If there are 16 guests, that means:
16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves.

Now, to make 2 deviled egg halves, you need 1 whole egg. So, for 48 deviled egg halves, you need:
48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 whole eggs.

Since eggs come in dozens, and 12 eggs make a dozen, we need:
24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs.

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"Well, let's see. Shiela needs to write a 15-page paper. She's done 1/3 of it, which is about 5 pages. So, she's got 10 pages left to write.

10"
"Okay, let's see. Mike has to read a 200-page book, and he plans to read 10 pages every day. If he reads 10 pages a day, he'll need 20 days to finish the book because 200 divided by 10 is 20. The teacher gave him 30 days to finish, so if he finishes in 20 days, he'll have 10 days left before the deadline. So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

10"
"Okay, let's see here. James bought a plane for $150,000. That's a big chunk of money right there. Then, every month, he pays $5,000 to keep it in a hanger. On top of that, he spends twice as much on fuel, which is $10,000 a month.

So, every month, he's spending $5,000 for the hanger and $10,000 for fuel, which adds up to $15,000 a month just to keep the plane running.

Now, to figure out how much he spends in a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12, because there are 12 months in a year. So, $15,000 times 12 is $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane, which is $150,000, to the yearly maintenance cost of $180,000, we get a total of $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

330000"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the pork took:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The beans took half the time it took to cook both the rice and the pork. First, we add the time for the rice and the pork:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the beans took half of that time:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up all the cooking times:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, let's look at the cost of the almonds and walnuts:
- Almonds cost $10 for a whole pound.
- Walnuts cost $15 for a whole pound.

Now, let's break down the first mixture:
- We have 1/2 pound of almonds. Since a whole pound costs $10, 1/2 pound would cost half of that, which is $5.
- We also have 1/3 pound of walnuts. Since a whole pound costs $15, 1/3 pound would cost one-third of that, which is $5.
- So, the total cost for the first mixture is $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10.

Next, let's break down the second mixture:
- We have 1/5 pound of almonds. Since a whole pound costs $10, 1/5 pound would cost one-fifth of that, which is $2.
- We also have 1/3 pound of walnuts, which we already know costs $5.
- So, the total cost for the second mixture is $2 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $7.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The first mixture costs $10.
- The second mixture costs $7.
- The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a simple person who knows a bit about animals.

So, Lee has sheep and geese. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, and the total number of legs is 70.

Let's break it down:

1. If all 20 animals were geese, they would have 20 * 2 = 40 legs.
2. But we have 70 legs in total, which is 30 more legs than if all the animals were geese.

Since each sheep has 2 more legs than a goose, we can figure out how many sheep there are by dividing the extra legs by 2:

30 extra legs / 2 legs per sheep = 15 sheep

So, Lee has 15 sheep on his farm.

"Okay, let's see here. Roger usually buys coffee that costs $5 a pound, but this time he had to get a more expensive kind that costs 20% more. So, 20% of $5 is $1, which means the new coffee costs $6 a pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee each day, and he's buying enough for a whole week, so that's 7 pounds. At $6 a pound, the coffee costs:
7 * $6 = $42

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is:
$42 + $2 = $44

"Okay, let's see. Gus spent $20 at the store. He got 2 bags of chips for $2 each, that's $4. He got a bucket of chicken for $8, and a soda for $1. So, that's $4 for chips, $8 for chicken, and $1 for soda, which adds up to $13. 

If he spent $20 and the other stuff cost $13, then the apple pie must have cost $20 - $13, which is $7.

"Okay, let's see. James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he gives to District B, we need to take away the numbers for District A and C from the total.

So, 600 minus 198 is 402. Then, 402 minus 209 is 193.

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, John goes to cooking class 4 times a week, and each class is 2 hours long. So, in one week, he spends:
4 times a week * 2 hours each time = 8 hours a week.

He does this for 6 weeks, so the total time he spends in class is:
8 hours a week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, for every 1.5 hours of class, he learns a new recipe. So, to find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5:
48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes.

So, John learns 32 recipes.

"Okay, let's see. There are 150 teachers on the basketball court. Sixty percent of them are history teachers, so that's 90 history teachers. The rest are math teachers, which means there are 60 math teachers. Each of these math teachers sleeps for 6 hours a day. So, if we want to know how many hours all the math teachers sleep together in one day, we just multiply the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep. That's 60 math teachers times 6 hours, which gives us 360 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

1. **Aurelia's Money:**
   - Aurelia has $120.

2. **Kassidy's Money:**
   - Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has.
   - So, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

3. **Rayna's Money:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - So, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

4. **Total Money:**
   - Add up all the money: \( 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \) dollars.

5. **Sharing Equally:**
   - There are 3 people, so each person gets \( \frac{360}{3} = 120 \) dollars.

So, if they share the money equally, each person would have 120 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Each part of the game, they call it a quarter, lasts 12 minutes, and there are 4 of these parts. So, that's 12 minutes times 4, which is 48 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we have 50 people in the company. Out of these, 20% are management. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- 20% of 50 is like saying 20 out of 100, which is the same as 1 out of 5.
- So, 50 divided by 5 is 10. That means there are 10 management people.

Now, out of these 10 management people, only 30% oversee the whole company. Let's figure out how many that is:
- 30% of 10 is like saying 30 out of 100, which is the same as 3 out of 10.
- So, 10 divided by 10 and then multiplied by 3 is 3.

So, 3 people oversee the whole company.

8.25 times 16 is 132.

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"Okay, let's see. Robert got 3 pounds of candy, Cindy got 5 pounds, and Aaron got 4 pounds. If they put all their candy together, that's 3 plus 5 plus 4, which makes 12 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Christina keeps track of her moods every day for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's figure out how many neutral days there were:
- Total days: 30
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

So, there were 10 neutral days.

Now, let's look at how the days were spread out:
- First 8 days: All good
- Next 8 days: All bad
- Next 8 days: All neutral
- Last 6 days: We need to figure these out

The problem says the next three days after the 24th day (which is the last day of the neutral period) were good, neutral, and good. So, the last 6 days are:
- Day 25: Good
- Day 26: Neutral
- Day 27: Good
- Day 28: Neutral
- Day 29: Neutral
- Day 30: Neutral

Now, let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Day 25: Good
- Day 27: Good

So, there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 6 days: 2 good days

Total good days in the 30 days:
- 8 + 2 = 10 good days

But we know there were 12 good days in total. So, the remaining good days are:
- 12 - 10 = 2 good days

So, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is right now. It's 20 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 20 by 12 to get the height in inches:
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. So, we need to find out how much more it needs to grow:
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide 360 by 30:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

But when he comes back, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so that's 24 dogs. He already has 12 toys, so he needs 12 more toys. Now he has 24 toys. But then, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need as many toys. He now needs 21 toys in total.

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances put in 2/3 of what was left, which is:
\[ 720 \times \frac{2}{3} = 480 \]

So, Frances also put in $480. Now, we need to see how much is left for Skyler:

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they are going over by:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they are 20 kg over the limit.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting cookies in a jar.

First, we know Katarina has 68 cookies. She has 5 less than Max, so Max must have:
68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster must have:
73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer must have:
73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, they have 298 cookies in total."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out.

So, Shania made her dress longer by half its original length and then added 20 more centimeters of lace at the bottom. The dress ended up being 140 centimeters long.

First, let's take away the 20 centimeters of lace:
140 centimeters - 20 centimeters = 120 centimeters

Now, the 120 centimeters is the original length plus half of the original length. So, if we call the original length ""L,"" then:
L + 0.5L = 120 centimeters

This means:
1.5L = 120 centimeters

To find L, we divide both sides by 1.5:
L = 120 centimeters ÷ 1.5
L = 80 centimeters

So, the original dress was 80 centimeters long.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows how to mow a lawn but not much about math.

So, Chris has this lawn mower that can go slow (turtle mode) or fast (rabbit mode). If he uses the slow mode, it takes him a whole hour to mow the whole lawn. If he uses the fast mode, it only takes him 40 minutes.

Today, he decided to do something different. He mowed half the lawn in slow mode and the other half in fast mode. 

- For the slow mode, since it takes him a whole hour to do the whole lawn, it would take him half an hour to do half the lawn. That's 30 minutes.
- For the fast mode, since it takes him 40 minutes to do the whole lawn, it would take him half of that time to do half the lawn. That's 20 minutes.

So, if he spent 30 minutes in slow mode and 20 minutes in fast mode, the total time he spent mowing the lawn is 30 + 20, which is 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

So, for the bananas, 2 kilos at 2 dollars each is 4 dollars. For the oranges, 2 kilos at 3 dollars each is 6 dollars. 

Now, let's add it all up: 4 dollars for apples, 4 dollars for bananas, and 6 dollars for oranges. That's 4 + 4 + 6, which is 14 dollars.

"Well, let's see. Greta made 30 cookies. Celinda made twice as many, so that's 60 cookies. Together, they made 30 plus 60, which is 90 cookies. But they ate 10 of 'em, so that leaves 80 cookies to put in the box.

80"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. Their combined ages add up to 44.

Let's call the age of one of the triplets ""R"" and the age of one of the twins ""T.""

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet:
   \( T = R + 7 \)

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
   \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

Now, let's substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify this:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 5R = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, we know the age of one of the triplets is 6. To find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Okay, let's see. John's got 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history to do. That's 20 + 40 + 20, which is 80 minutes of homework. He's got 3 hours before dinner, and 3 hours is 180 minutes. So, if he does his homework, he'll have 180 - 80 minutes left. That's 100 minutes. So, John can nap for 100 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of the 5 lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

That means the 4 candies must have cost:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, each candy costs:
\[ 1.20 \div 4 = 0.30 \]

Now, we want to know the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. So, in one year, which has 12 months, Rong saves:
20 coins/month × 12 months/year = 240 coins/year

In ten years, Rong saves:
240 coins/year × 10 years = 2400 coins

Now, Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. First, we need to find out how many more coins that is:
2/5 of 20 coins = (2/5) × 20 = 8 coins

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves:
20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins/month

In one year, Neil saves:
28 coins/month × 12 months/year = 336 coins/year

In ten years, Neil saves:
336 coins/year × 10 years = 3360 coins

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil:
2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins

So, after ten years, Rong and Neil have saved a total of 5760 coins.

5760"
"Okay, let's see here. John's dog needs two vaccines, and each one costs $20. So, that's $20 times 2, which is $40 for the vaccines. Now, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we add the cost of the vaccines to the heartworm check, we get the total bill.

Let's call the total bill ""T."" The heartworm check is 60% of T, so that's 0.60 times T. The vaccines cost $40, so we can write it like this:

\[ 40 + 0.60T = T \]

To find T, we need to solve this equation. We can do that by moving 0.60T to the other side:

\[ 40 = T - 0.60T \]
\[ 40 = 0.40T \]

Now, to find T, we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

25"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins.

First, we got 5 bananas. They say one banana costs twice as much as an apple. An apple costs 50 cents, so a banana costs 100 cents, or 1 dollar. So, 5 bananas cost 5 dollars.

Next, we got 12 apples. Each apple costs 50 cents. So, 12 apples cost 6 dollars.

Then, we got 7 oranges. They say an orange costs three times as much as a banana. A banana costs 1 dollar, so an orange costs 3 dollars. So, 7 oranges cost 21 dollars.

Now, we add it all up:
- Bananas: 5 dollars
- Apples: 6 dollars
- Oranges: 21 dollars

Total: 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars

So, the crate of fruit costs 32 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares. That's easy to remember, 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The blue squares are 4 more than the red squares. So, if we have 14 red squares, we add 4 more to get the blue squares.
   - 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The green squares are 6 more than the blue squares. So, if we have 18 blue squares, we add 6 more to get the green squares.
   - 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The white squares are 12 fewer than the green squares. So, if we have 24 green squares, we take away 12 to get the white squares.
   - 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up all the squares to find out how many there are in total:
- 14 red squares + 18 blue squares + 24 green squares + 12 white squares = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

So, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. First, we need to know how many chairs we need in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so we add those together:
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]
   So, we need 57 chairs in total.

2. Now, let's see how many chairs the restaurant already has. It has 8 high chairs, and 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, we multiply 8 by 5 to find out how many regular chairs there are:
   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40
   \]
   So, there are 40 regular chairs.

3. Now, let's add the high chairs and the regular chairs to find out how many chairs the restaurant has in total:
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]
   So, the restaurant has 48 chairs.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many more chairs we need. We subtract the number of chairs the restaurant has from the total number of chairs we need:
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

So, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 50 deer in the field. Half of them are bucks, so:
50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8-point bucks. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8-point bucks, so:
25 bucks * 20% = 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks

So, there are 5 8-point bucks.

5"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. Adam has 50 points. That's like having 50 marbles.
2. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. So, we need to find out what 30% of 50 is. That's 15 more points. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, they are missing:
400 - 255 = 145 points

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

145"
"Well, let's see. Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids. Each of those kids has 3 kids of their own, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 grandkids. Now, each of those 9 grandkids has 3 kids of their own, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 great grand-babies. So, there will be 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion.

27"
"Okay, let's see. Greta gets $2400. She puts half of it into her retirement, so that's $1200. Then, she uses 20% for her car, which is $480. So, if we take away $1200 and $480 from $2400, we get $720 left. 

So, Greta has $720 left to spend."
"Well, let's see. If the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 are missing, that means there are 16 pencils in the box. Now, if we want to know how many pairs of pencils there are, we just need to split those 16 pencils into groups of 2. So, 16 divided by 2 is 8. 

8 pairs of pencils are in the box."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, that's 15 times 20, which is 300 fireworks in total.

Now, Hannah can only see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many that is, we take 40% of 300. That's 0.40 times 300, which equals 120 fireworks.

Hannah also has her own fireworks. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, that's 3 times 5, which is 15 fireworks.

To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we add the 120 fireworks she can see from the city to the 15 fireworks she sets off herself. That's 120 plus 15, which equals 135 fireworks.

So, Hannah will see 135 fireworks in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting on our fingers.

1. **Count the people:**
   - Aiden and his 12 friends: 1 + 12 = 13
   - They meet 7 more friends: 13 + 7 = 20
   So, there are 20 people in total.

2. **Seats and what they can hold:**
   - Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks.
   - For 20 seats, that's 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
   - And 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

3. **Cost of drinks and snacks:**
   - Each drink costs $2, so 40 drinks * $2 = $80
   - Each snack costs $2, so 60 snacks * $2 = $120

4. **Total cost:**
   - Add the cost of drinks and snacks: $80 + $120 = $200

So, the group spent 200 dollars on snacks and drinks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds.
3. When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary all work together, their trucks can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Now, to find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to add up what Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry and then see how much is left for Gary's truck.

4. Gissela's and Gordy's trucks together can carry 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds.
5. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds, so Gary's truck must carry the rest: 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2800"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we know there are 6 girls, and each girl ate 3 dumplings. So, the girls ate:
6 girls * 3 dumplings each = 18 dumplings

Next, there are 8 boys, including Larry, and each boy ate 1 more dumpling than each girl. Since each girl ate 3 dumplings, each boy ate:
3 dumplings + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

So, the boys ate:
8 boys * 4 dumplings each = 32 dumplings

Now, to find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the girls and the boys:
18 dumplings (girls) + 32 dumplings (boys) = 50 dumplings

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings. 

50"
"Okay, let's see. Gerald and Julia split $100 in a 3:2 ratio. That means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts. 

So, if we split $100 into 5 parts, each part is $20. 

Gerald gets 3 parts, so he gets 3 times $20, which is $60. 

If Gerald spends $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 left, which is $50.

So, Gerald has $50 left.

"Okay, let's think about this. If the cat can run 15 feet in one second, and the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, then the turtle must be moving 3 feet in one second (because 15 divided by 5 is 3). 

Now, if the turtle moves 3 feet in one second, in 40 seconds, it would move 3 feet times 40 seconds, which is 120 feet.

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

120"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't been to school much.

The firefighters want to raise $6300. After 3 hours, they've already got $2100. That means they still need to raise $6300 - $2100, which is $4200.

Now, if they raised $2100 in 3 hours, that means they're raising $700 every hour. To find out how many more hours they need to raise the rest, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise each hour:

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours.

So, they need 6 more hours to reach their goal. But they've already been fundraising for 3 hours, so in total, they need to fundraise for:

3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

So, they need to fundraise for 9 hours in total to reach their goal.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

The city uses 40% of the water from the river. That means for every 100 gallons of water in the river, the city takes 40 gallons.

Now, 80% of that 40 gallons is used for industrial stuff. So, we need to find out how much 80% of 40 gallons is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ gallons} \]

So, 32 gallons out of the 40 gallons are used for industrial purposes. That leaves us with:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

These 8 gallons are used for non-industrial purposes. Since the city takes 40 gallons out of every 100 gallons in the river, the 8 gallons used for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out what percent this is of the total river water:
\[ \frac{8}{100} \times 100 = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"
"Well, let's see. If Alex charges $12 for each day and there are 7 days in a week, then for one week she charges $12 times 7, which is $84. For two weeks, you just double that, so it's $84 times 2, which comes out to $168. So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

168"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out.

So, the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. That means in one hour, they make 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream. If they keep making it for 48 hours, they'll make:

50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Now, for the vanilla ice cream, they make 50 quarts in 4 hours. That means in one hour, they make 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream. If they keep making it for 48 hours, they'll make:

12.5 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

So, if we add the chocolate and vanilla ice cream together, the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts.

"Okay, let's see here. Marcus bought a bunch of stuff:

- 5 croissants at $3 each, so that's 5 times 3, which is $15.
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so that's 4 times 2.50, which is $10.
- 3 mini quiches at $4 each, so that's 3 times 4, which is $12.
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1 each, so that's 13 times 1, which is $13.

Now, let's add all that up: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. So, 10% of $50 is $5.

So, we take $50 and subtract $5, which gives us $45.

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

"Okay, let's think about this. The ice cream place is giving a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's see how many scoops she can buy with her money:
- $6.00 divided by $1.50 per scoop is 4 scoops.

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 more for free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's figure out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get:
- $6.00 can buy 4 scoops, which is 2 sets of 2 scoops (4 scoops total), and she gets 2 free scoops (1 free for each set of 2).

So, she gets 4 scoops + 2 free scoops = 6 scoops.

Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to figure out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's figure out how many days are in two weeks:
- 2 weeks = 14 days

Now, let's see how many pieces of candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces

Next, let's see how many pieces of candy Amy eats in 14 days:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces

Now, let's find out how much candy each of them has left:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left

Finally, let's see how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces, and Ginger has 44 pieces, so Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

36 divided by 3 is 12, and 12 times 2 is 24. So, he wants to cover 24 square feet.

Now, for every square foot, he needs 24 tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need 24 times 24 tiles.

24 times 24 is 576.

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles.

James went to pick blueberries. It cost him $20 just to go pick them, and then he had to pay $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds.

First, let's see how much he paid for the blueberries:
- He picked 30 pounds, and each pound costs $1.5.
- So, 30 pounds times $1.5 per pound is 30 * 1.5 = $45.

Now, add the $20 it cost him to go picking:
- $45 for the blueberries + $20 to go picking = $65.

Next, let's see how much it would have cost him to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- At the store, blueberries cost $2.5 per pound.
- So, 30 pounds times $2.5 per pound is 30 * 2.5 = $75.

Now, let's find out how much he saved:
- If he bought the blueberries at the store, it would have cost him $75.
- But he only spent $65 by picking them.
- So, he saved $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

Now, the new price of each computer is $700 plus $70, which is $770.

To find out how much the company paid for all 500 computers, we multiply $770 by 500. 

So, $770 times 500 is $385,000.

The total amount of money they paid is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we got the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, we do 6 times 75, which is 450 calories from the eggs.

Next, the cheese. John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce has 120 calories. So, 2 times 120 is 240 calories from the cheese.

Then, there's the ham. John uses the same amount of ham as cheese, so that's 2 ounces of ham. Each ounce of ham has 40 calories. So, 2 times 40 is 80 calories from the ham.

Now, we add all these up:
- 450 calories from the eggs
- 240 calories from the cheese
- 80 calories from the ham

450 plus 240 plus 80 equals 770 calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories.

So, the total cost is 3 dollars for the pencils plus 2 dollars for the erasers, which is 5 dollars. If I paid 10 dollars, then the change I get back is 10 dollars minus 5 dollars, which is 5 dollars.

- 100 people times 30% (which is the same as 0.30) equals 30 people who get interviews.

Next, out of these 30 people who get interviews, only 20% get a job offer. So, we need to figure out how many that is:
- 30 people times 20% (which is the same as 0.20) equals 6 people who get job offers.

Finally, out of these 6 people who get job offers, only a third of them actually take the job. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- 6 people divided by 3 equals 2 people who accept the job.

So, 2 people accept the position.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Helga can tap her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute when her arms are at her sides. When she raises her arms, she can only tap each foot 200 times a minute.

She dances for 5 minutes total, but she only raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. So, she has her arms at her sides for 3 minutes.

First, let's figure out how many taps she does with her arms at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 900 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 750 taps

Now, let's figure out how many taps she does with her arms raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps

Now, let's add up all the taps:
- Total right foot taps: 900 + 400 = 1300 taps
- Total left foot taps: 750 + 400 = 1150 taps

Finally, let's add the total taps from both feet:
- Combined total taps: 1300 + 1150 = 2450 taps

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:
2450"
"Well, let's see here. If Ron don't fix that pothole, it's gonna cost him $450 in car repairs. But if he fixes it himself, he's gotta pay a $120 fine and buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each. So, the asphalt costs $75 total. Add that to the fine, and it's $195 to fix it himself.

Now, if not fixing it costs $450 and fixing it costs $195, then he saves $450 - $195, which is $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"Okay, let's see. The restaurant had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. That's 170 + 23, which is 193 chairs in total. Then, they sent 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs to the carpenter. So, 20 + 13 is 33 chairs that were sent away. 

Now, if we take the 33 chairs away from the 193 chairs, we get 193 - 33, which is 160 chairs left.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. **Total Pizzas and Slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each got a pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - So, 5 pizzas times 12 slices each equals 60 slices total.

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - 2/3 of 12 slices is 8 slices per pizza.
   - So, 3 people times 8 slices each equals 24 slices eaten.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends:**
   - The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - 3/4 of 12 slices is 9 slices per pizza.
   - So, 2 people times 9 slices each equals 18 slices eaten.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends to the slices eaten by the other two friends.
   - 24 slices + 18 slices equals 42 slices eaten.

5. **Slices Left:**
   - Subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices available.
   - 60 slices - 42 slices equals 18 slices left.

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 18. 

18"
"Okay, let's think about this. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog is faster and takes only 2/3 of that time. So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the same number of sausages.

Now, to find the average time, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2.

So, 30 minutes (cat) + 20 minutes (dog) = 50 minutes. Then, 50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time they take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Topher's shoes are really big, and we know that one of his shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches long. First, we need to turn that into just inches. 

1 foot is 12 inches, so 8 feet is 8 times 12, which is 96 inches. Add the 4 inches, and we get 100 inches. So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Now, the problem says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe ""B"" inches.

So, we can write it like this:
100 = 9B + 10

To find B, we need to solve this equation. First, we take away 10 from both sides:
100 - 10 = 9B
90 = 9B

Now, we divide both sides by 9:
90 ÷ 9 = B
10 = B

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

**10 inches**"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff.

First, we got 64 student cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the student cars is:
64 cars * 4 windows = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows. A quarter is like cutting something into 4 pieces and taking one piece. So, she smashes:
256 windows / 4 = 64 windows.

Next, we got 32 teacher cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teacher cars is:
32 cars * 2 windows = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3 out of every 4 windows in the teacher cars. That's like cutting something into 4 pieces and taking 3 pieces. So, she smashes:
64 windows * 3 / 4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the windows she smashed in both the student and teacher cars:
64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, Hannah smashed 112 windows in total.

112"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff in my head.

First, we need to know how many spools of thread Candy has in total. She's got:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

So, if we add all these up:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools in total.

Next, we need to know how many of these are blue. The blue ones are:
- 15 light blue
- 45 dark blue

So, the total number of blue spools is:
15 + 45 = 60 blue spools.

Now, to find out what percent of the spools are blue, we take the number of blue spools (60) and divide it by the total number of spools (150), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 60 divided by 150 is 0.4. Then, 0.4 times 100 is 40.

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

40%"
"Okay, let's see. At 8:00, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. So, that's like 2/5 of 5000, which is 2000 people. That means 3000 people were still waiting to vote.

By 16:00, 2 out of every 3 of those 3000 people had voted. So, 2/3 of 3000 is 2000 people. That means 1000 people still hadn't voted by 16:00.

1000"
"Okay, let's think about this. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day. If he needs enough gum to last for 30 days, we need to figure out how many pieces that is first. 

So, 4 pieces a day for 30 days is:
\[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, each pack has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total pieces by the number of pieces in a pack:
\[ 120 \div 15 = 8 \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we need to know how many smores everyone wants:
- 9 kids want 2 smores each. So, 9 kids times 2 smores is 18 smores.
- 6 adults want 1 smore each. So, 6 adults times 1 smore is 6 smores.

Now, let's add those up:
- 18 smores for the kids plus 6 smores for the adults equals 24 smores in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers we need:
- Each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, we need to see how many 8s go into 24.
- 24 divided by 8 is 3. So, we need 3 sleeves of graham crackers.

Finally, we need to know how many boxes of graham crackers we need:
- Each box has 3 sleeves. So, 3 sleeves divided by 3 sleeves per box is 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

1"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. Her dad's age is eight more than twice her age. So, we do the math:
- Twice Dora's age is 15 times 2, which is 30.
- Then, add 8 to 30, which gives us 38.
So, Dora's dad is 38 years old.

Next, Dora's mom is four years younger than her dad. So, we take Dora's dad's age and subtract 4:
- 38 minus 4 is 34.
So, Dora's mom is 34 years old.

Now, to find the total combined age, we add up all their ages:
- Dora is 15, her dad is 38, and her mom is 34.
- 15 plus 38 plus 34 equals 87.

So, the total combined age of Dora, her dad, and her mom is 87."
"Well, let's see. Greg found $20 and he's gonna share it with his 3 younger siblings. That makes 4 of them in total. If you split $20 into 4 parts, each part is $5. So, each of them got $5.

"Okay, let's see here. Cindy's got some books, and we need to figure out how much they all weigh together.

- Her math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. So, that's 2 pounds for math and 2 pounds for science, which adds up to 4 pounds.
- Her French book is 4 pounds.
- Her English book is 3 pounds.
- Her history book is twice as heavy as her English book, so that's 6 pounds.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (History) = 17 pounds.

So, Cindy's books all together weigh 17 pounds."
"Okay, let's see. If there were 100 voters, and candidate A got 20 of those votes, that means A got 20 votes. Candidate B got 50% more than A, so that's half of 20, which is 10 more votes. So, B got 20 + 10, which is 30 votes. Now, if A got 20 votes and B got 30 votes, that's 50 votes in total. So, the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50, must have gone to candidate C. That means C got 50 votes.

50"
"Okay, let's see. Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 less, so that means Beck has 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 90 apples left, and Beck will have 87 apples. Now, if we check how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, it's 90 minus 87, which is 3. So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Peter makes 3 giant ice cubes. Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. So, for 3 giant cubes, he uses:
3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces

Next, he makes 7 medium ice cubes. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. So, for 7 medium cubes, he uses:
7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces

Then, he makes 8 small ice cubes. Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water. So, for 8 small cubes, he uses:
8 cubes * 1/2 ounce/cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up all the water he used:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water he has left is:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Okay, let's see. If Clara has 20 books and that's twice as many as Steven, then Steven must have 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 16 books. Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we just take Clara's 20 books and subtract Alice's 16 books. That gives us 4.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, I know a gallon jar costs $5. The problem says a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if I take $2 away from $5, I get the cost of a half-gallon jar:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]
So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, I need to find out how much 10 gallon jars cost. If one gallon jar costs $5, then 10 gallon jars would cost:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
So, 10 gallon jars cost $50.

Now, I need to find out how much 16 half-gallon jars cost. If one half-gallon jar costs $3, then 16 half-gallon jars would cost:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]
So, 16 half-gallon jars cost $48.

Finally, I add the cost of the 10 gallon jars and the 16 half-gallon jars to get the total amount of money spent:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Okay, let's see. There are 50 kids in the class. Some of them like different things. 10 kids like baking, 5 like basketball, and the rest like video games or music. The number of kids who like music is twice the number who like basketball, so that's 10 kids who like music.

Now, let's count how many are left for video games. We have 50 kids total. We take away the 10 who like baking, the 5 who like basketball, and the 10 who like music. That leaves us with:

50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25

So, 25 kids like to play video games.

25"
"Well, let's see. Jeremy saw 12 birds, and he scared away 1/3 of them. So, 1/3 of 12 is 4. That means 4 birds flew away. Now, 12 minus 4 is 8 birds left. Then, 20 more birds came to join the 8 that were left. So, 8 plus 20 is 28. 

28 birds are now in the backyard."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, there are two classes with a total of 80 students. Since both classes have the same number of students, we can split 80 in half:
\[ 80 \div 2 = 40 \]
So, each class has 40 students.

Now, in each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls that is, we take 40% of 40:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

"Okay, let's see here. Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate. She added 3 more, so that's 5 slices. Then she got really hungry and made it three times as many, so that's 15 slices. She ate 2 slices, so now there's 13. Her friend took 5 slices while she wasn't looking, so that leaves 8 slices on the plate.

8 slices left."
"Okay, let's see. Melissa has a bunch of animals to take care of this week. She's got 8 dogs to bathe, 5 cats to clip nails for, 3 birds to trim wings for, and 12 horses to brush. That's a lot of animals!

First, let's count all the animals:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Now, let's add them up:
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

There are 7 days in a week, so we need to split 28 animals over 7 days. If we do the math:
28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards, and each pack costs $1800. So, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Now, let's look at what he gets from the packs:
- One card worth $4000
- Another card worth $1000
- 30 more cards, each worth $50

First, we add up the value of the two special cards:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

Next, we calculate the total value of the 30 cards:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Now, we add the value of all the cards together:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find out how much profit Mark made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark made a profit of:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's look at the first amusement park:
- For the adults, it's $26 each. There are 2 adults, so that's 2 times $26, which is $52.
- For the kids, it's $12 each. There are 2 kids, so that's 2 times $12, which is $24.
- Add those together: $52 for the adults and $24 for the kids, which gives us $76 total.

Now, let's look at the second amusement park:
- For the adults, it's $14 each. There are 2 adults, so that's 2 times $14, which is $28.
- For the kids, it's $10 each. There are 2 kids, so that's 2 times $10, which is $20.
- Add those together: $28 for the adults and $20 for the kids, which gives us $48 total.

To find out how much they save, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:
- $76 (first park) minus $48 (second park) equals $28.

So, if Jake's family chooses the second amusement park, they will save $28.

28"
"Okay, let's see here. The guy used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for 50 cents each. So, he was spending 500 times 50 cents, which is 250 dollars a day. Now, he's buying them for 40 cents each, so he's spending 500 times 40 cents, which is 200 dollars a day. 

So, he's saving 250 minus 200, which is 50 dollars a day. If he saves 50 dollars a day, over a week, that's 50 times 7, which is 350 dollars.

350"
"Okay, let's see here. Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so that's 4 times 56, which is 224 marbles for Carl. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, which is 2 times 56, so Cal has 112 marbles. 

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add 224 and 112. That's 336 marbles.

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined."
"Okay, let's think about this. We got 54 students, and we need to split them into 6 groups. That means each group has 9 students, right? Now, if we need 12 groups instead, we still have the same number of students, but we need to make more groups. 

So, if we already have 6 groups and we need 12, we need to make 6 more groups. 

6 more groups."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we need to know how many days there are in two 4-week months. Each week has 7 days, so:
- 4 weeks have 4 x 7 = 28 days.
- Two 4-week months have 2 x 28 = 56 days.

Next, we need to figure out how many of those days are weekdays and how many are weekends. Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days, so:
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 5 = 20 weekdays.
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 2 = 8 weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are 2 x 20 = 40 weekdays.
- In two 4-week months, there are 2 x 8 = 16 weekend days.

Now, let's count the chairs:
- On weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day. So, for 40 weekdays, she rents out 60 x 40 = 2400 chairs.
- On weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day. So, for 16 weekend days, she rents out 100 x 16 = 1600 chairs.

Finally, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- Total chairs rented = 2400 + 1600 = 4000 chairs.

So, Candy will rent out 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

1. Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold took half of them. Half of 48 is 24, so Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas. So, 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Later, Arnold took 12 bananas. So, 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas. So, 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Jenna has 4 roommates, so that makes 5 people in total. The electricity bill is $100 each month. 

First, we need to find out how much the bill is for the whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \]

Now, we need to split this $1200 among the 5 people. So, we divide 1200 by 5:
\[ 1200 \div 5 = 240 \]

So, each person, including Jenna, will pay $240 per year for electricity.

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff in my head.

First, Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. A dozen is 12, so 8 dozen is 8 times 12, which is 96 glasses.

Next, he sent 4 dozen plates. So, 4 dozen is 4 times 12, which is 48 plates.

When they came back, 10 glasses were broken. So, 96 glasses minus 10 broken ones is 86 glasses left.

Also, 6 plates were broken. So, 48 plates minus 6 broken ones is 42 plates left.

Now, we add the glasses and plates that are left: 86 glasses plus 42 plates equals 128 items in total.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now. 

128"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. That means she trades:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]
Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. That means she trades:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]
Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, by the end, she has:
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 20 large buttons

Each large button is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Adding all the small buttons together:
\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, Lorraine has 147 buttons by the end.

"Okay, let's think about this. There are 33 people in the council. The number of people who said yes is twice the number of people who said no. 

If we say the number of people who said no is \( x \), then the number of people who said yes is \( 2x \). 

So, \( x + 2x = 33 \).

That means \( 3x = 33 \).

If \( 3x = 33 \), then \( x = 11 \).

So, the number of people who said yes is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting apples.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 kids need XS shirts. That's 11 shirts.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many kids need S shirts as XS shirts.
   - So, 11 kids need XS, and twice that is 22 kids for S shirts.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less kids need M shirts than S shirts.
   - So, 22 kids need S, and four less is 18 kids for M shirts.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many kids need L shirts as M shirts.
   - So, 18 kids need M, and half that is 9 kids for L shirts.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more kids need XL shirts than L shirts.
   - So, 9 kids need L, and six more is 15 kids for XL shirts.

Now, let's add them all up:
- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts."
"Okay, let's see. If the bag is $140 and there's a 5% discount, I need to figure out what 5% of 140 is. 

5% of 140 is like taking 5 out of every 100, so that's 7 bucks. 

Now, if I take 7 bucks off 140, I get 133. 

So, you'll pay $133 for the bag after the discount.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, if one playlist has 300 songs, and John has 20 playlists, then the total number of songs John has is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Now, if each song is 10 hours long, then the total time for all the songs is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"Okay, let's see here. If 20 out of every 100 people think horse #2 will win, that means 10 out of 50 people think so. So, 50 minus 10 is 40 people left.

Now, 60 out of every 100 of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. That's 24 people. So, 40 minus 24 is 16 people.

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, Jana has some puppies, and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. Out of these Pomeranians, one-third are girls, and we know there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, if 6 Pomeranian girls are one-third of all the Pomeranians, then all the Pomeranians must be three times that number:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, if 18 Pomeranians are two-thirds of all the puppies, then the total number of puppies must be:
\[ 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"Well, let's see. Jayden had 70 bucks from sellin' his pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her 90 bucks, so that's 45 bucks. Now, Jayden has 70 plus 45, which is 115 bucks. The camera costs 200 bucks, so he needs 200 minus 115, which is 85 bucks more.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular guy, not some fancy book learner.

So, we got three houses that need new roofs. The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. The first house needs half as many as the second house, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's break it down:

- If the first house needs half as many as the second, and the third needs double the first, we can think of it like this:
  - First house: 1 part
  - Second house: 2 parts (because it's double the first)
  - Third house: 2 parts (because it's double the first)

So, if we add all these parts together, we get:
- 1 part (first house) + 2 parts (second house) + 2 parts (third house) = 5 parts

Now, we know the total is 250 cases. So, each part is:
- 250 cases ÷ 5 parts = 50 cases per part

Since the third house needs 2 parts, it will need:
- 2 parts × 50 cases per part = 100 cases

So, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's see. Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs 2 dollars, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 dollars. Jack got 5 tomatoes, and each tomato is 1 dollar, so that's 5 times 1, which is 5 dollars. Chase bought 1 head of lettuce for 3 dollars. So, if we add all that up, 6 dollars for the cucumbers, 5 dollars for the tomatoes, and 3 dollars for the lettuce, that's 6 plus 5 plus 3, which is 14 dollars.

"Okay, let's see. If George has 200 bananas and he's got 45% more pears than bananas, we need to figure out how many pears that is. 

First, 45% of 200 bananas is 90 more pears. So, George has 200 bananas plus 90 more pears, which means he has 290 pears.

Now, to find out how many fruits he has in total, we add the bananas and the pears together:
200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits.

So, George has 490 fruits. 

490"
"Okay, let's see. Marissa had 80 dollars. She spent 20 dollars on a ball, so she had 60 dollars left. Candy bars cost 5 dollars each. So, if she had 60 dollars left, she could buy 60 divided by 5, which is 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

"Okay, let's see. Ezra read 300 books this hour and then decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra read a total of 300 plus 150, which is 450 books.

Now, if Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, then Ahmed must have read half of what Ezra read in the first hour. So, Ahmed read 300 divided by 2, which is 150 books.

Together, they read 450 plus 150, which is 600 books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes and works for 5 hours. She gets $15 for each hour she works. So, for 5 hours, she earns:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day. So, her total for Monday is:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes and works for 2 hours. She gets $15 for each hour she works. So, for 2 hours, she earns:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she taught only 2 classes, she doesn't get the extra $5. So, her total for Wednesday is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up what she made on both days:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned 110 dollars for these two days of teaching."
"Okay, let's see here. They got 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each. So, that's 4 times 5, which is 20 vanilla scents sold.

Now, for the fruity scents, they got 8 of them and sold 2 of each. So, that's 8 times 2, which is 16 fruity scents sold.

To find out how many more vanilla scents sold, we take the vanilla scents sold and subtract the fruity scents sold. So, 20 minus 16 is 4.

So, 4 more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents.

"Okay, let's see. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, he makes:

20 eggplants * $3 = $60

He wants to make a total of $135. So, he still needs:

$135 - $60 = $75

He has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he needs to sell each ear for, we do:

$75 / 25 ears = $3 per ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. So, she has a total of 12 hours over the weekend.

She reads for 3 hours. That leaves her with 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, 1/3 of 9 hours is 3 hours.

That means she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for playing soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we take the 6 hours she spends playing soccer and divide it by the total 12 hours, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Okay, let's see. Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon, so that's 25 pencils. Now, Anthony has 25 pencils left. Then, he gave 3 out of every 5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, if we split the 25 pencils into 5 parts, each part is 5 pencils. Three parts would be 15 pencils. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Jack is driving to a museum that's 150 miles away. He drives at 75 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to get there, you divide the distance by the speed:
- 150 miles ÷ 75 miles per hour = 2 hours.

So, it takes him 2 hours to get to the museum. He has to drive back home too, so that's another 2 hours. That's 4 hours of driving in total.

Now, Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, we add the time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum:
- 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we need to know how many wheels Henry needs for the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has 57 cars. So, we do:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels for the cars.

Next, we need to know how many wheels for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, we do:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together:
228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels in total.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels are left after he uses what he needs, we subtract the total wheels needed from the wheels he has:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels left.

So, Henry will have 276 wheels left.

"Okay, let's see. If the laptop costs $1000 and I get a 20% discount, that means I save 20 out of every 100 dollars. So, for $1000, I save 200 dollars. If I take away the 200 dollars I save from the original price, I have to pay $800.

800"
"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Mike has 600 movies. He can get a third of them for a cheaper price because they are in series. That means he has 200 movies in series. These series movies cost only $1.67 each (which is $10 divided by 6). So, for the 200 series movies, he pays:

200 movies * $1.67 = $334

Now, he has 400 movies left. Out of these, 40% are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, he has 160 older movies (40% of 400). For these older movies, he pays:

160 movies * $5 = $800

The rest of the movies are newer and cost $10 each. He has 240 newer movies (400 - 160). For these newer movies, he pays:

240 movies * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$334 (series movies) + $800 (older movies) + $2400 (newer movies) = $3534

So, the total cost to replace all the movies is $3534."
"Well, let's see. If peaches cost 2 dollars a pound and Winston picked 6 pounds, that's 12 dollars for peaches. For plums, at 1 dollar a pound and 8 pounds, that's 8 dollars. And for apricots, 3 dollars a pound and 6 pounds, that's 18 dollars. Now, if we add all that up: 12 plus 8 plus 18, that makes 38 dollars. So, Winston spent 38 dollars on fruit.

38"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we know the Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours. They spent 1.5 hours hiking, so they must have driven for the rest of the time. That means they drove for 6 hours minus 1.5 hours, which is 4.5 hours.

Now, they drove at a speed of 50 miles per hour. So, to find out how far they drove, we multiply the time they drove by their speed:
\[ 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they hiked is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
\[ 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level with time left on the clock. Here's what we know:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **Points for Enemies:**
   - Emma jumps on some number of enemies, let's call it \( E \).
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Each enemy is worth 10 points.
   - So, Emma gets \( 10E \) points.
   - Ava gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.

2. **Points for Berries:**
   - Emma collects some number of berries, let's call it \( B \).
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Each berry is worth 5 points.
   - So, Emma gets \( 5B \) points.
   - Ava gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.

3. **Points for Time Left:**
   - Emma finishes the level with some number of seconds left, let's call it \( T \).
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Each second left is worth 30 points.
   - So, Emma gets \( 30T \) points.
   - Ava gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points:

- Emma's total score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's total score: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \)

Simplify Ava's total score:
- \( 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

The difference is:
- \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

So, the difference between their scores is:

"Okay, let's see. Four friends got four pizzas for 64 dollars. Two of those pizzas cost 30 dollars together. So, the other two pizzas must have cost:

34 / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we got 5 days where Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times each day. So, for those 5 days:
3 rides a day times 5 days = 15 rides.

Then, there are 2 special days where they ride twice as much. So, on these days, they ride:
3 rides a day times 2 = 6 rides a day.
And for 2 days, that's:
6 rides a day times 2 days = 12 rides.

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days together:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

So, in one week, they ride their bikes 27 times.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out step by step.

Bob started with 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. When he got home, he found out he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Fish:**
   - Orange: 3
   - White: 4

2. **Total Fish After Buying:**
   - Total fish Bob has now: 7 (initial) + 17 (bought) = 24 fish

3. **Final Condition:**
   - He has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say he bought \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish. We know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (total fish bought)
- After buying, the number of white fish is \( 4 + x \)
- After buying, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \)

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
- \( 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \)

Now, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Simplify the equation:**
   - \( 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \)
   - \( 3 + y = 8 + 2x \)
   - \( y = 8 + 2x - 3 \)
   - \( y = 5 + 2x \)

2. **Substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into \( x + y = 17 \):**
   - \( x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \)
   - \( x + 5 + 2x = 17 \)
   - \( 3x + 5 = 17 \)
   - \( 3x = 12 \)
   - \( x = 4 \)

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To check:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2 \times 4 = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct)

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Andy drives to work and back home each day. The one-way trip is 5 miles, so the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days.

So, the total distance he drives in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Next, his car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles. So, for 50 miles, he would use:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, gas costs $3 per gallon. So, for 5 gallons, the cost would be:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy spends $15 on gas each week to go to work.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins and bills.

First, let's count the quarters:
- I got 140 quarters.
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, or a quarter of a dollar.
- So, 140 quarters times 25 cents each is 35 dollars.

Next, let's look at the twenties:
- I got 10 twenties.
- Each twenty is worth 20 dollars.
- So, 10 twenties times 20 dollars each is 200 dollars.

Now, I only spent 3 out of every 5 of the twenties:
- 3 out of 5 is the same as 3/5.
- 3/5 of 200 dollars is 120 dollars.

Finally, let's add up what I spent:
- I spent 35 dollars in quarters and 120 dollars in twenties.
- So, 35 dollars plus 120 dollars is 155 dollars.

The total amount I paid for lunch is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees at night.

Now, we need to make sure the house doesn't get below 32 degrees, or the pipes will freeze. So, we need to figure out how many degrees we need to raise the temperature:
32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs we need, we divide the total degrees we need by the degrees each log provides:
20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

Now, the problem says that 3 out of every 5 groups had members bring back seashells. So, we need to figure out how many of the 10 groups that is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups has 9 people, and each person brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells that is:
\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells they brought back is:

Now, on Tuesday, she worked 3 extra hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. So, her overtime rate is:
150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour

For the 3 extra hours, she gets:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. The company starts with 200 employees.
2. Every month, they add 20 more employees.
3. After 3 months, they would have added 20 employees each month for 3 months, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 new employees.
4. So, after 3 months, the total number of employees is 200 (initial) + 60 (new) = 260 employees.
5. Each employee gets paid $4000 per month.
6. For 260 employees, the monthly salary cost is 260 * 4000 = $1,040,000.
7. Over 3 months, the total cost is 1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Billy started at $10 an hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of 50 cents, so his new pay was $10.50 an hour. On his one-year anniversary, he got another raise of $1, making his pay $11.50 an hour.

Sally started at a job where she makes 50 cents more per hour than Billy did when he started. So, Sally makes $10.50 an hour.

Now, if both work 20 hours, we need to see how much each makes:
- Billy makes $11.50 an hour, so for 20 hours, he makes \( 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \) dollars.
- Sally makes $10.50 an hour, so for 20 hours, she makes \( 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \) dollars.

To find out how much more Billy makes than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's:
- \( 230 - 210 = 20 \) dollars.

So, Billy earns $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"Well, let's see. If a loaf of bread costs $2, then 3 loaves would cost $6. Now, if a bagel costs $1, then 2 bagels would cost $2. So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"Okay, let's see. Pierson scored 278 points. Now, Nikita scored a bit more than half of that. Half of 278 is 139, and Nikita got 11 more than that. So, Nikita scored 150 points. If we add Pierson's and Nikita's points together, that's 278 plus 150, which gives us 428 points in total.

428"
"Well, let's see. If each class has 25 kids and there are 40 classes, that means there are 1000 kids in total. Each kid plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees from the kids.

Now, for the teachers. If there are 3 teachers in each of the 40 classes, that means there are 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 240 trees from the teachers.

Add the trees from the kids and the teachers together, and you get 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted is 1240."
"Okay, let's think about this. Bubbles has a bunch of stuffed animals:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

That's a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Now, she wants to buy some stuffed goats so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

If we let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she buys, then the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + \( x \).

We want the goats to be 30% of this total, so:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Let's solve this step by step:

1. \( x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \)
2. \( x = 4.2 + 0.30x \)
3. \( x - 0.30x = 4.2 \)
4. \( 0.70x = 4.2 \)
5. \( x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \)
6. \( x = 6 \)

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. That's 14 days. So, 14 days times half an hour each day is 7 hours.

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days. So, 7 days times 2 hours each day is 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours from both periods:
7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to get the achievement. So, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours needed:
30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about driving.

So, we got two cars on the highway. The first car is going 60 miles an hour, and the second car, which is faster, is going 70 miles an hour. The second car passes the first one and they both keep going at their own speeds.

Now, if the second car is going 10 miles an hour faster, it means every hour, it gets 10 miles ahead of the first car. So, after 2 hours, it would be 20 miles ahead.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"Okay, let's see. James bought a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. That's $900 for the materials. He also had to pay a 30% extra for it to be made. 

Now, 30% of $900 is $270. So, he paid $900 for the materials and $270 extra. 

So, the total he paid is $900 + $270, which is $1170.

1170"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many kids passed in each grade:
- In third grade, 340 out of 500 kids passed.
- In fourth grade, 40 out of 100 kids passed.
- For fifth grade, it says the pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. So, if 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, that's 40%. Twice that is 80%, which means 80 out of 100 fifth graders passed. Since there are 400 fifth graders, 80% of 400 is 320 kids who passed.

Now, let's add up all the kids who passed:
- Third grade: 340
- Fourth grade: 40
- Fifth grade: 320
Total kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Next, we need to know the total number of kids who took the test:
- Third grade: 500
- Fourth grade: 100
- Fifth grade: 400
Total kids who took the test: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of kids who passed by the total number of kids who took the test:
700 / 1000 = 0.70

So, the overall pass rate is 70%.

70%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Milo's got two bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he's got:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

It takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. So, with 144 chips, he can make:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

First, we got 4 kids who each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, we do:
4 kids * 1.5 quarts = 6 quarts

Next, we got 16 more kids who each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, we do:
16 kids * 2 quarts = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea these kids drank:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

We also know there were 10 quarts left over. So, we add that to the total:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

To find out how many gallons that is, we need to remember that 4 quarts make a gallon. So, we do:
48 quarts ÷ 4 quarts per gallon = 12 gallons

So, there were 12 gallons of tea at the start of the party.

"Well, let's see. Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, which means he sold all 100 he had and needed 50 more to cover the sales. Then, he got 100 more candies.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can count and double things.

At the start of the year, there are 10 students on campus. Every month, the number of students doubles. So, let's see how many students there are at the end of each month:

- At the end of January: 10 students become 20 students.
- At the end of February: 20 students become 40 students.
- At the end of March: 40 students become 80 students.
- At the end of April: 80 students become 160 students.
- At the end of May: 160 students become 320 students.

Now, we started with 10 students, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. To find out how many new students joined, we subtract the original 10 students from the 320 students:

320 - 10 = 310

So, 310 new students joined by the end of May.

310"
"Well, let's see. Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges 25 cents for each branch he climbs. So, to figure out how many branches he climbed, we take the $105 and divide it by 25 cents. That's like saying, how many times does 25 cents go into $105? 

$105 is the same as 10500 cents. So, 10500 divided by 25 is 420. That means he climbed 420 branches in a week.

Now, to find out how many branches he climbed each day, we take the 420 branches and divide it by 7, because there are 7 days in a week.

420 divided by 7 is 60. So, Felix climbed 60 branches each day on average.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting things out.

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, that's:
3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, that's:
4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, that's:
5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, that's:
6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals

Now, let's add all those petals together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

But, oh no! She drops 1 of each type of flower. So, we need to take away:
1 flower with 5 petals = 5 petals
1 flower with 6 petals = 6 petals
1 flower with 4 petals = 4 petals
1 flower with 7 petals = 7 petals

Total petals lost:
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

So, the petals left in the vase are:
101 - 22 = 79 petals

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 79."
"Okay, let's see here. John and DeSean got a bag with 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, so that's 18 marshmallows used. They also dropped 3 marshmallows. So, 18 plus 3 is 21 marshmallows gone. 

Now, 35 minus 21 leaves us with 14 marshmallows. Since there are two of them, they can split the 14 marshmallows evenly. So, each of them can have 7 more S'mores.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting pennies in a jar.

Jack and his 3 friends are playing at the arcade for 4 hours. That's 240 minutes, 'cause 4 hours times 60 minutes in an hour equals 240 minutes.

Now, Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. So, in 240 minutes, Jack can play:
240 minutes divided by 20 minutes per quarter equals 12 quarters.

Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter. In 240 minutes, each of these friends can play:
240 minutes divided by 10 minutes per quarter equals 24 quarters each.

The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter. In 240 minutes, this friend can play:
240 minutes divided by 30 minutes per quarter equals 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters:
Jack uses 12 quarters.
The two friends use 24 quarters each, so that's 24 times 2 equals 48 quarters.
The other friend uses 8 quarters.

So, the total number of quarters used is:
12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total money used is:
68 quarters times 25 cents per quarter equals 1700 cents, which is 17 dollars.

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time. Tanya makes a salt scrub and fills a 10-ounce jar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. 

So, if we say the amount of citrus zest is 1 ounce, then the fragrance is also 1 ounce. The salt is twice the zest, so that's 2 ounces. The sugar is the same as the salt, so that's also 2 ounces. The oil is twice the salt, so that's 4 ounces.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Citrus zest: 1 ounce
- Fragrance: 1 ounce
- Salt: 2 ounces
- Sugar: 2 ounces
- Oil: 4 ounces

1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces, which is exactly what fits in the jar.

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Well, let's see. John bought 3 goats, and each goat cost him $500. So for the goats, he spent 3 times 500, which is $1500. Then, he bought 2 cows, and each cow cost him $1500. So for the cows, he spent 2 times 1500, which is $3000. Now, to find out the total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together. That's $1500 plus $3000, which equals $4500. So, John spent $4500 in total.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has:

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So, he gives away:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, let's see how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe is left with 16 cars.

"Okay, let's see. The charity got a total of $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the rest must have come from the students. 

To find out how much the students raised, we take the total and subtract the amount from organizations:
$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, there are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:
$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. That's a long walk!

On the second day, she walked half as much time as the first day. So, half of 8 hours is 4 hours.

Now, we need to add the time from both days:
8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To find out how many minutes that is, we need to remember that 1 hour is 60 minutes. So, we multiply 12 hours by 60 minutes:
12 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

So, Sandy walked for a total of 720 minutes over the two days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Hunter saw 50 cars when he got to school. Then, during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, we add those together:

So, there were 70 cars in the parking lot after the first break.

Next, during the lunch break, half of the cars left. Half of 70 is:
\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]
So, 35 cars left.

Now, to find out how many cars were left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
35"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

So, for one cycle, he makes:
5 tasks × $1.20 = $6.00

Now, for 30 cycles in a day, he makes:
30 cycles × $6.00 = $180.00

If he works 7 days a week, then in a week he makes:
7 days × $180.00 = $1260.00

So, John makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week.

"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie, being on the other team, scored 4 points less than Sasha. So, Julie scored 10 points.

For the second game, Sasha played at Julie's home court. Sasha usually doesn't do as well away from home. This time, Sasha scored 6 points less than what Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

Now, to find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games:
14 points (first game) + 4 points (second game) = 18 points.

So, Sasha scored 18 points in total."
"Okay, let's see here. Kimberly got 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, for the cat food, that's 8 times 11, which is 88 tins.

For the dog food, she got 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, for the dog food, that's 6 times 6, which is 36 tins.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she got, we take the cat food tins and subtract the dog food tins. So, 88 minus 36 is 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we know that the total number of cards is 341. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ has some number of cards, and we'll call that number \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to find out what \( P \) is. We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"Well, let's see. Cindy got 5 green eggs. She got twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so that's 10 blue eggs. She got one less pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 9 pink eggs. And she got one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 3 yellow eggs.

Now, if we add all those up:
5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to ship the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges 35 cents for each pound. So, we do:
4 pounds times 35 cents, which is:
4 * 0.35 = 1.40 dollars

Next, the shipping company also charges 8 cents for each mile, and the book needs to go 20 miles. So, we do:
20 miles times 8 cents, which is:
20 * 0.08 = 1.60 dollars

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total shipping cost:
1.40 dollars + 1.60 dollars = 3.00 dollars

Amazon will give Milly back 75% of the book's price. The book cost 32 dollars, so we do:
32 dollars times 75%, which is:
32 * 0.75 = 24 dollars

Milly originally paid 32 dollars for the book. She gets 24 dollars back from Amazon, but she also has to pay 3 dollars to ship the book back. So, we do:
32 dollars - 24 dollars + 3 dollars = 11 dollars

So, Milly will lose:

"Okay, let's see. Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars in a month. In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars. The second week, he makes half of that, so that's 4,000 bars. The third week, he makes three times what he made in the first week, so that's 24,000 bars. 

Now, let's add up what he made in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

So, to find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we take the total monthly production and subtract what he made in the first three weeks: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Britany makes 18 TikTok videos each week. Each video is 4 minutes long. So, for the videos:
- 18 videos times 4 minutes each is 72 minutes a week.
- Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 72 minutes times 4 weeks is 288 minutes.

Next, she spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to turn that into minutes:
- 2 hours is 120 minutes.
- So, 120 minutes a week times 4 weeks is 480 minutes.

Then, she does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week:
- 15 minutes times 6 days is 90 minutes a week.
- 90 minutes a week times 4 weeks is 360 minutes.

Now, let's add all that up:
- 288 minutes for videos
- 480 minutes for songs
- 360 minutes for makeup

288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, the company says they charge $129 for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. That's the basic deal.

Now, Angela has more stuff:
- She has 6 mirrors, but the basic deal only covers 4, so she needs 2 more mirrors.
- She has 2 chandeliers, but the basic deal only covers 1, so she needs 1 more chandelier.
- She has 20 pictures, but the basic deal only covers 10, so she needs 10 more pictures.

For each extra item, they charge $15. So, we need to count how many extra items Angela has:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures

That's 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 extra items.

Now, 13 extra items at $15 each would be:
13 * 15 = $195

So, the total cost is the basic deal plus the extra items:
$129 + $195 = $324

Angela will have to pay $324.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. That's pretty small, right?
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, 12 times 1 inch is 12 inches. That's a foot!
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, 4 times 12 inches is 48 inches. That's 4 feet.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, 10 times 48 inches is 480 inches. 

Now, to figure out how many feet that is, we need to remember that 12 inches make a foot. So, 480 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Well, let's see. Mason is riding his bike at 8 miles every hour. He rides for 4 hours, so that's 8 miles times 4 hours, which gives us 32 miles. Then, he takes a rest, but that doesn't change how far he's already gone. After his rest, he rides for another 6 hours. So, that's 8 miles times 6 hours, which is 48 miles. Now, to find out how far he's gone in total, we add the miles from before his rest and after his rest. So, 32 miles plus 48 miles equals 80 miles. 

Mason has traveled 80 miles in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't gone to school much.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross a highway, that means they're moving pretty slow. Now, if turtles are moving at half the speed of these kangaroos, they're going to take even longer to cross the same distance.

First, let's figure out how long it would take one turtle to cross the highway. Since turtles are half as fast as kangaroos, it would take one turtle twice as long as one kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo would take 18 hours, one turtle would take 36 hours.

But we have 4 turtles, and they're all moving together. So, they should be able to cover the distance faster than one turtle alone. Since 4 turtles are moving together, we divide the time it would take one turtle by 4:

36 hours ÷ 4 = 9 hours

But wait, I made a mistake. The 18 hours is for 3 kangaroos together, not one. So, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 18 hours too, because they're all moving at the same speed. 

Since turtles are half as fast, one turtle would take 36 hours. But with 4 turtles, it's 36 hours ÷ 4 = 9 hours.

But that's not right either. I need to think about it this way: if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, and turtles are half as fast, then 4 turtles should take:

18 hours × 2 (because they're half as fast) ÷ 4 (because there are 4 turtles) = 9 hours.

No, that's still not right. Let's try again:

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, and turtles are half as fast, then 4 turtles should take:

18 hours × 2 (because they're half as fast) ÷ 4 (because there are 4 turtles) = 9 hours.

But I think I got it now. The correct answer is:

27 hours."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 × 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the dishes:
Kora's dishes: 20
Rory's dishes: 40
Jada's dishes: 80

Total dishes: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, they all made 140 dishes together."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. But if she trades in her old one, the price goes down by $200. So, the new price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika has some money in her purse, and she got $150 from her part-time job. Her mom also gave her $80. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

So, let's add up what she has:
\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

This means:
\[ \text{Money in purse} + 230 = 350 \]

To find out how much money is in her purse, we subtract 230 from 350:
\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

120"
"Okay, let's see. If Adam slices 3 big apples and each big apple gives 5 pieces, that's 15 pieces from the big apples. Then, he slices 5 small apples, and each small apple gives 3 pieces, so that's 15 pieces from the small apples. So, he has 15 pieces from the big apples and 15 pieces from the small apples, which makes 30 pieces in total. If Adam eats 15 pieces, then he has 15 pieces left.

15"
"Okay, let's think about this. If one cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, and the farmer has 3 cows, that means he gets 15 liters of milk a day. He wants to get 25 liters a day. So, he needs 10 more liters. Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 2 more cows to get those extra 10 liters.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to know how much glue is left in each stick. 

1. The first stick has 1/6 left. If the stick is 12 millimeters long, then 1/6 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \div 6 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second stick has 2/3 left. So, 2/3 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \div 3 = 4 \text{ millimeters}, \text{ and then } 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third stick has 1/2 left. So, 1/2 of 12 millimeters is:
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up all the remaining glue:
\[
2 \text{ millimeters} + 8 \text{ millimeters} + 6 \text{ millimeters} = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Okay, let's see. Gabriel wants to buy a car and a phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800. So, the total cost is $10000 + $800, which is $10800.

Now, Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, he has $5000 + $200, which is $5200.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we take the total cost and subtract the money he has. So, $10800 - $5200 is $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

5600"
"Well, let's see. Thea gave the craftsman four twenty-dollar bills, so that's eighty dollars. The hat cost seventy dollars. So, if you take seventy from eighty, she should get ten dollars back. 

10"
"Okay, let's see here. Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, so that's 40 dollars. He buys 6 squirt guns for 2 dollars each, so that's 12 dollars. He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for 3 dollars each, so that's 9 dollars. 

Now, let's add up what he spent: 12 dollars for the squirt guns and 9 dollars for the water balloons, which is 21 dollars in total. 

So, if he started with 40 dollars and spent 21 dollars, he has 19 dollars left.

19"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. Jack has 60 dishes. That's a lot of dishes!
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if he has 60 dishes, he must have half that many socks. That means Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, if Jack has 30 socks, Peter has 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 30 dishes.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Jack's socks and dishes: 30 socks + 60 dishes = 90 items
- Peter's socks and dishes: 60 socks + 30 dishes = 90 items

So, together they have:
- 90 items (Jack) + 90 items (Peter) = 180 items

180"
"Okay, let's see. There are 20 kids in the class. 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. That means there are 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 kids left. These 7 must be the ones who are good at both math and English. So, to find out how many are good at math, we add the ones good at math only and the ones good at both: 5 + 7 = 12.

12"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't been to school much.

Vicki's planning a pop concert that's gonna last 2 hours. That's 120 minutes. She's giving each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off stage. That's 10 minutes for each group. She's also planning a 10-minute break in the middle.

So, if we take out the 10-minute break from the 120 minutes, we have 110 minutes left for the groups to perform. If each group takes 10 minutes, we can figure out how many groups can fit in 110 minutes by dividing 110 by 10.

110 divided by 10 is 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

11"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done this before.

Brenda put $300 into a savings plan. This plan gives her extra money each year, and the extra money is three-quarters of the $300 she put in. So, every year, she gets an extra $225 (because three-quarters of $300 is $225).

Now, we need to find out how much extra money she gets after 3 years. We do this by multiplying the extra money she gets each year by 3:
$225 * 3 = $675

So, after 3 years, she gets an extra $675 on top of her original $300. To find out the total amount she has, we add the extra money to her original amount:
$300 + $675 = $975

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have $975 in total.

$975"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we got 40 white shirts. Half of them have collars, so that means 20 of them have collars and 20 don't.

Next, we got 50 floral shirts. Out of these, 20 have buttons. So, the rest, which is 50 minus 20, don't have buttons. That means 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars. We have 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars.

So, 30 minus 20 is 10.

The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's see. The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. So, we need to figure out how many trays that is. 

900 eggs divided by 30 eggs per tray equals 30 trays.

Now, if each tray sells for $2.5, then we need to find out how much 30 trays will sell for.

30 trays times $2.5 per tray equals $75.

So, the farmer will earn $75.

75"
"Okay, let's see here. Mr. Smith has two farms. In Farm X, he starts with 55 goats and sells 10, so he's got 45 left. In Farm Y, he starts with 45 goats and sells 20, so he's got 25 left. Now, if we add the goats left in both farms, that's 45 plus 25, which gives us 70 goats altogether.

70"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. That means in a year, he buys:
2 pairs/month × 12 months = 24 pairs of shoes.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays for each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
$2640 ÷ 24 pairs = $110 per pair.

So, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes.

110"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, I need to know how much 3 baskets of green food cost. Each basket of green food is $25, so:
3 baskets × $25 = $75

Next, I need to figure out the cost for 3 baskets of red food. Each basket of red food is $18, so:
3 baskets × $18 = $54

But wait, there's a deal! I get $2 off for each basket of red food. So, for 3 baskets, I save:
3 baskets × $2 = $6

Now, I subtract the savings from the cost of the red food:
$54 - $6 = $48

Finally, I add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

So, I'll have to pay $123 in total.

123"
"Okay, let's think about this. There are 90 rooms, and we need to clean half of them. Half of 90 is 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, for 45 rooms, it would be 45 times 20 minutes. That's 900 minutes. Now, to turn minutes into hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 900 divided by 60 is 15. It would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms.

15"
"Okay, let's see. In the first year, they build 12 homes. Next year, they build three times that, so that's 36 homes. So far, that's 12 plus 36, which is 48 homes. In the third year, they double what they've built so far, so that's 48 times 2, which is 96 homes. Adding all that up, 12 plus 36 plus 96, that's 144 homes.

144"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

I'm three years younger than my brother, so if I'm \( x \) years old, my brother is \( x + 3 \) years old.
I'm also two years older than my sister, so my sister is \( x - 2 \) years old.
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) years old.

Now, if we add all our ages together, it equals 87. So we can write it like this:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Let's break it down:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine all the \( x \) terms and the numbers:
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Mr. Jackson's class has 27 kids, and he wants to give each kid 2 glue sticks. So, we need to find out how many glue sticks that is in total:

27 kids times 2 glue sticks each equals 54 glue sticks.

Now, the glue sticks come in packs of 8. We need to figure out how many packs of 8 we need to get at least 54 glue sticks. If we divide 54 by 8, we get 6.75. But we can't buy a part of a pack, so we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7.

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Well, let me think this through. On the first day, the river had 4000 gallons of water. After the heavy rain, it doubled, so that's 8000 gallons on the second day. Then, on the third day, it went up by another 6000 gallons. So, if you add 8000 and 6000, you get 14000 gallons. That's how much water was passing through the river on the third day.

14000"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't gone to school much.

So, we start with 10 people who are sick. Each of these 10 people makes 6 more people sick every day. We need to figure out how many people are sick after 3 days.

**Day 1:**
- The 10 sick people each make 6 more people sick.
- So, 10 times 6 is 60 new sick people.
- Add the 60 new sick people to the original 10, and we have 70 sick people.

**Day 2:**
- Now, all 70 sick people each make 6 more people sick.
- So, 70 times 6 is 420 new sick people.
- Add the 420 new sick people to the 70 we already had, and we have 490 sick people.

**Day 3:**
- Now, all 490 sick people each make 6 more people sick.
- So, 490 times 6 is 2940 new sick people.
- Add the 2940 new sick people to the 490 we already had, and we have 3430 sick people.

So, after 3 days, there are 3430 people who are sick.

"Okay, let's see. Jennifer had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, so that's 2 times 3, which is 6 oranges. Then she gave 3 oranges to her boy. So, 6 plus 3 is 9 oranges given away. 

Now, if she started with 12 and gave away 9, she's left with 12 minus 9, which is 3 oranges.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can count and figure things out.

Claire gets 1 badge every month. So, in a year, which is 12 months, she gets 12 badges. That's easy to count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Amber takes twice as long to get a badge as Claire. So, if Claire gets 1 badge in a month, Amber gets 1 badge in 2 months. In a year, which is 12 months, Amber gets half as many badges as Claire. So, Amber gets 6 badges in a year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wendy gets three times as many badges as Claire in the same time. So, if Claire gets 12 badges in a year, Wendy gets 3 times that. That means Wendy gets 36 badges in a year: 12, 24, 36.

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy gets compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber gets from the number of badges Wendy gets. So, 36 minus 6 is 30.

Wendy gets 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours.
2. Every hour, she bakes 2 loaves of banana bread. So in 5 hours, she bakes:
   2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves.
3. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, 10 loaves give us:
   10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.
4. Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, 80 slices sold at 50 cents each make:
   80 slices × 50 cents/slice = 4000 cents.
5. Since 100 cents make a dollar, 4000 cents is:
   4000 cents ÷ 100 cents/dollar = 40 dollars.

So, Paige raised 40 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. Mr. George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic.
2. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, 50 students times 10 burritos each equals 500 burritos for the students.
3. Mr. George ate 20 burritos himself.
4. So, the total number of burritos used is 500 (for the students) plus 20 (for Mr. George), which is 520 burritos.
5. To find out how many burritos are left, we subtract the total number of burritos used from the total number of burritos ordered: 600 burritos minus 520 burritos.

So, the number of leftover burritos is 80.

80"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. The rink has 12 red cars. That's easy to remember.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, if we take away 2 from 12, we get 10 green cars.
3. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. So, if we multiply 10 by 3, we get 30 blue cars.
4. Now, let's add up all the cars we know about: 12 red + 10 green + 30 blue = 52 cars.
5. The rink has 75 cars in total. So, to find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of cars we already counted from the total: 75 - 52 = 23.

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're just figuring it out together.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books altogether. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. We need to find out how many books Fawn has.

Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books. Then Anne has \( F - 12 \) books because she has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we add up all the books:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"Okay, let's see. Daisy got a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also got a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed twice as much as the potatoes, so that's 10 pounds. Then, she got a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weighed 10 pounds minus 3 pounds, which is 7 pounds. 

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

First, we need to know how many jello cups Greg wants to make. There are 30 kids, and each kid gets 4 jello cups. So, we do:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Each box makes 10 jello cups. So, we do:
\[ 120 \text{ jello cups} \div 10 \text{ jello cups per box} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to know how much it will cost. Each box costs $1.25. So, we do:

"Okay, let's see. The guy bought 5 phones, and each phone costs $700. So, 5 times 700 is 3500. He gave the seller $4000. So, if we take away the cost of the phones, which is $3500, from the $4000 he gave, we get $500 left over. So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

500"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 on groceries each month. Madeline pays 60% of that, so she pays 60 out of every 100 dollars. To find out how much that is, we do:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

So, Madeline pays $240. That means Keenan pays the rest. To find out how much Keenan pays, we subtract what Madeline pays from the total:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Keenan pays $160 each month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find out how much he pays each week:

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Tobias got a big pizza with 60 pieces. On the first day, he ate 2 out of every 5 pieces. So, if we split 60 pieces into 5 parts, each part has 12 pieces. He ate 2 of those parts, which is 24 pieces.

So, after the first day, he has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 more pieces. So, 36 - 10 = 26 pieces are left.

On the third day, he ate 7 out of every 13 pieces left. If we split 26 pieces into 13 parts, each part has 2 pieces. He ate 7 of those parts, which is 7 * 2 = 14 pieces.

So, after the third day, he has eaten 24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48 pieces.

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles cost $21, then one bottle costs:

So, one bottle of soda costs $3.

Next, we need to know how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles cost $8, then one bottle costs:
\[ 8 \div 4 = 2 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda. That would cost:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]
So, 3 bottles of soda cost $9.

He also wants to buy 2 bottles of water. That would cost:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
So, 2 bottles of water cost $4.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9 + 4 = 13 \]

So, David will need to pay $13.

"Okay, let's see. David has $12.48 and he wants to buy 16 bolts. Each bolt costs 3 cents, which is $0.03. 

To find out how much 16 bolts cost, I'll multiply 16 by $0.03:
16 times 0.03 is 0.48.

Now, I'll subtract the cost of the bolts from the money David has:
$12.48 minus $0.48 is $12.00.

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts.

12.00"
"Okay, let's see. Ella made $33 for 3 hours of walking dogs. That means she makes $11 for each hour because $33 divided by 3 is $11. If she works for 12 hours, we just need to multiply $11 by 12. So, $11 times 12 is $132.

- Amy gets 80% right.
- So, she gets 8 out of 10 right.
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- So, she gets 8 points from these.

Next, the true/false questions:
- There are 20 of them.
- Amy gets 90% right.
- So, she gets 18 out of 20 right.
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- So, she gets 18 points from these.

- There are 5 of them.
- Amy gets 60% right.
- So, she gets 3 out of 5 right.
- Each question is worth 5 points.
- So, she gets 15 points from these.

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, he sells each chicken for $50. So, the total money he makes from selling 180 chickens is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means the money he spent to buy the chickens is the total money he makes minus the profit:

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for:
\[ 7000 \]"
"Okay, let's see. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. That means the boys together sold 32 - 14, which is 18 glasses. Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number, they each sold 18 divided by 2, which is 9 glasses each. So, Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 9 glasses. Julie sold 14 - 9, which is 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, let's see here. Iris spent $400 on her hair. For the manicure, she spent a quarter of that, which is $100. For the pedicure, she spent three-quarters of what she spent on the manicure, which is $75. 

So, if we add all that up:
- Hair: $400
- Manicure: $100
- Pedicure: $75

Total: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

Iris spent $575 at the spa."
"Okay, let's see. Sarah has a rope that's 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, if we do the math, 20 meters times $2 is $40. That's how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope.

Now, Sarah wants to buy a new rope with that money. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. So, for 20 meters, it would be 20 meters times $1.5, which is $30.

If Sarah has $40 and the new rope costs $30, she will have $40 minus $30 left. That means she will have $10 left over.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18, that means right now she is 18 minus 10, which is 8 years old. Now, we want to know when she will be three times her current age. Three times 8 is 24. So, we need to figure out how many years it will take for her to be 24. If she is 8 now, and we want her to be 24, we subtract 8 from 24, which gives us 16. So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24, which is three times her current age.

16"
"Okay, let's see here. Kelly's got 5 packs of bacon for $10, so each pack is $2. She's got 6 packets of chicken, and each one costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so that's $4 each. Six packets of chicken at $4 each is $24. 

She's also got 3 packs of strawberries at $4 each, so that's $12. And 7 packs of apples, each costing half of what a pack of strawberries costs, so that's $2 each. Seven packs of apples at $2 each is $14.

Now, let's add it all up: $10 for bacon, $24 for chicken, $12 for strawberries, and $14 for apples. That's $60 in total.

Kelly's budget is $65, so if she spends $60, she has $5 left.

"Okay, let's think about this. Elaina's final concert was 65 minutes long, and that includes a 15-minute encore. So, the actual concert without the encore was 65 minutes minus 15 minutes, which is 50 minutes. Now, the problem says this concert was twice as long as her usual concerts. So, if 50 minutes is twice as long, then her usual concerts must be half of 50 minutes. Half of 50 is 25. So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

25"
"Well, let's see. Argo had 200 toys. He gave 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. So, that's 40 plus 80 plus 30, which is 150 toys given away. If he started with 200 and gave away 150, he's left with 50 toys.

50"
"Okay, let's see here. On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas. On Wednesdays, they make another 125 chimichangas. And on Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, so that's 250 chimichangas. 

Now, if we add all those up:
- 125 on Tuesday
- 125 on Wednesday
- 250 on Friday

That's 125 + 125 + 250, which equals 500 chimichangas.

So, they make 500 chimichangas on those three days.

500"
"Okay, let's think about this. The singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't be paired up. First, we need to figure out what 20% of 50 is. 

20% of 50 is 10. So, 10 microphones can't be paired up. That leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that can be paired up.

Now, to pair up the 40 microphones, we divide 40 by 2, because each pair has 2 microphones.

40 divided by 2 is 20.

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"Okay, let's see here. Jerry saw 6 birds in the bushes. Then he saw some birds flying, which was 2 out of every 3 of the 6 birds, so that's 4 birds. He also saw 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which is 24 birds. 

Now, let's add them all up:
6 birds in the bushes,
4 birds flying,
24 birds feeding.

So, 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds in total.

"Well, let's see. Lani made 55 cookies. She ate 5 of 'em, so that leaves 50 cookies. She put those 50 cookies in 5 jars, so each jar gets 10 cookies.

"Okay, let's see here. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, 5 orchids times 5 petals each, that's 25 petals for the orchids.

Now, she also has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, 4 daisies times 10 petals each, that's 40 petals for the daisies.

To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we subtract the petals of the orchids from the petals of the daisies. So, 40 petals minus 25 petals, that's 15 more petals for the daisies.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these are indoor plants. So, if we split 100 into four parts, each part is 25. That means there are 25 indoor plants.

Now, we have 100 plants total, and 25 of them are indoor plants. So, the number of plants left is:
100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Out of these 75 plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants. To find two-thirds, we can split 75 into three parts and then take two of those parts. Each part is:
75 ÷ 3 = 25.
So, two parts are:
25 × 2 = 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we have 75 plants left, and 50 of them are outdoor plants. So, the number of flowering plants is:
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find what percent of the total 100 plants are flowering plants, we take the number of flowering plants (25) and divide it by the total number of plants (100), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
(25 ÷ 100) × 100 = 25%.

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants. 

25%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, we got this whatchamacallit that spins real fast, 121 meters every second. They say it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide 121 by 11. That gives us 11 meters per second for the thingamabob.

Now, a whirligig spins 5 times as fast as a thingamabob. So, we take the 11 meters per second of the thingamabob and multiply it by 5. That gives us 55 meters per second for the whirligig.

So, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

55"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half that, so the yogurt costs $3. That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for all her food. If the salad and yogurt cost $9, then the two carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots, one carrot must cost $2 ÷ 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Okay, let's see. Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's 40 hours a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $12 an hour because they gave him a $2 raise. So, if he makes $12 an hour and works 40 hours a week, he makes:

$12 * 40 = $480

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

480"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Tasha made $80 last month. She did two things: she sold lemonade and she mowed lawns. We need to find out how much she made from the lemonade.

First, let's figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. We know Joe paid her $6. Now, we need to figure out how many times she mowed lawns.

- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as much as Joe's.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as much as Joe's.

If Joe's lawn was mowed once, then:
- Kamala's lawn was mowed 3 times.
- Alba's lawn was mowed 5 times.

So, in total, she mowed lawns:
1 (Joe's) + 3 (Kamala's) + 5 (Alba's) = 9 times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the lawn mowing, and she mowed 9 times, she made $6 from mowing lawns.

Now, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
$80 (total) - $6 (lawn mowing) = $74.

So, Tasha made $74 from selling lemonade.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Martin weighs 55 kg.
2. Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin. So, Carl weighs:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
3. Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl. So, Christian weighs:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian. So, Harry weighs:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

So, Harry weighs 74 kg."
"Okay, let's see here. John rents his car out 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, that's 10 times 3, which is 30 hours in total. He gets paid $25 for each hour. So, 30 hours times $25 is $750. His car payment is $500. To find out how much he makes after paying for the car, we take the $750 he earns and subtract the $500 car payment. That leaves him with $250.

So, John makes $250 profit on his car.

250"
"Okay, let's think about this. Martha had some notebooks, then she bought 5 more and ended up with 7. So, before buying more, she had 7 - 5, which is 2 notebooks. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had, so he had 3 times 2, which is 6 notebooks. Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6. So, Martha has 7 - 6, which is 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Okay, let's see. Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than Dijana. So, 1/5 of 50 is 10 miles. That means Anis rowed 50 miles plus 10 miles, which is 60 miles. 

Now, if Dijana rowed 50 miles and Anis rowed 60 miles, together they rowed 50 + 60, which is 110 miles.

So, the total distance they rowed is 110 miles."
"Well, let's see. Susan made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4, so that leaves 96 cookies. If she wants to split these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we just need to divide 96 by 6. That gives each nephew 16 cookies.

"Okay, let's see here. Denise read 10 pages yesterday and then 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday, which was 13 pages. So, Denise read 18 pages today. That means Denise read a total of 28 pages. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and nothing today, so he read 13 pages in total. 

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out.

Calvin's got a pot of soup. It's enough to fill 4 big bowls for adults or 8 smaller bowls for kids. Calvin, his wife, and their two kids are all eating.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they each get a big bowl. That's 2 big bowls. Since 1 big bowl is the same as 2 small bowls, 2 big bowls are the same as 4 small bowls.

So, out of the 8 small bowls the pot can make, 4 are used up by Calvin and his wife. That leaves 4 small bowls for the kids.

Calvin has two kids, and they each get one small bowl at a meal. So, with 4 small bowls left, each kid can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Okay, let's see. William bought five notebooks and one ballpen. Each notebook costs $1.50, and the ballpen costs $0.50.

First, I'll figure out how much the notebooks cost:
- Five notebooks at $1.50 each would be 5 times 1.50, which is $7.50.

Next, I'll add the cost of the ballpen:
- The ballpen costs $0.50.

So, the total cost is:
- $7.50 for the notebooks plus $0.50 for the ballpen, which equals $8.00.

William spent $8.00 in all.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs 2 yards divided by 4 masks, which is 0.5 yards per mask.
- If she needs to make 20 small masks, she'll need 20 times 0.5 yards, which is 10 yards.

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs 2.25 yards divided by 3 masks, which is 0.75 yards per mask.
- If she needs to make 8 large masks, she'll need 8 times 0.75 yards, which is 6 yards.

Now, to find out the total material needed:
- She needs 10 yards for the small masks and 6 yards for the large masks.
- So, the total material needed is 10 yards + 6 yards, which is 16 yards.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Deepa saw 9 movies, and she saw each one 3 times. So, she saw movies 9 times 3, which is 27 times. She spent $216 on all these movie tickets. To find out how much each ticket cost on average, we divide the total money she spent by the number of times she went to the movies.

So, $216 divided by 27 is $8.

The average price she paid per ticket is $8.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. That's a lot of sleep!

Next, he works 2 hours less than he sleeps. So, if he sleeps for 10 hours, he works for 10 - 2, which is 8 hours.

Then, he walks his dog for 1 hour each day. That's a nice little break in his day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these things:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

So, 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so if we subtract the 19 hours he spends on these activities from 24, we get:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"Okay, let's see here. Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue ones and a third of the red ones for fishing.

First, let's figure out how many red shoe boxes he uses. A third of 9 is 3. So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's count how many are left:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, in total, Tim has 4 blue and 6 red shoe boxes left. That's 10 shoe boxes in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. 

Duncan is 60 years old now. Eight years ago, he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. 

The problem says that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, 52 is two times Adam's age four years ago. 

To find Adam's age four years ago, we divide 52 by 2:
52 / 2 = 26

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. To find out how old Adam is now, we add 4 years to 26:
26 + 4 = 30

Adam is 30 years old now. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to 30:
30 + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"Well, let's see. Farmer Brown's got 200 acres. Farmer Smith's place is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's. So, twice Farmer Brown's is 400 acres, and adding 100 more makes it 500 acres for Farmer Smith. Now, if we put both farms together, that's 200 acres plus 500 acres, which gives us 700 acres in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages each hour. So, that means he does:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, for each package, he gets paid 20 cents. So, for 40 packages, he earns:
40 packages * 20 cents = 800 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 800 cents is the same as:
800 / 100 = 8 dollars per hour.

Colby works for 8 hours a day, so his total earnings for the day are:
8 dollars/hour * 8 hours = 64 dollars.

So, Colby earns 64 dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. That means he drinks one bottle every 30 minutes.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, we need to figure out how long an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes:

45 minutes times 4 is 180 minutes.

Now, we need to figure out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks one bottle every 30 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:

180 divided by 30 is 6.

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. We know there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
- 2 pieces per red balloon
- 20 red balloons
- So, 2 pieces × 20 balloons = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know Benny threw 58 pieces in total. If 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, then the rest must have been thrown at the yellow balloons:
- 58 pieces total - 40 pieces for red balloons = 18 pieces for yellow balloons

Next, we need to find out how many yellow balloons there are. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon:
- 18 pieces ÷ 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

So, the number of yellow balloons is:

"Well, let's see. Jon drives his car 100 miles every day. In a month, which has 30 days, he drives:

100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we need to figure out how many times 1000 goes into 3000:

3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

5 hours on Tuesday + 10 hours on Wednesday + 8 hours on Thursday = 23 hours.

So, Bruce works 23 hours in total over these three days."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting our pennies.

1. The cake cost $11.
2. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2, so for 12 balloons, that's 6 times $0.5, which is $3.
3. The ice cream tubs cost $7 each, and they bought 2, so that's $14.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine spent $28 together, and they had the same amount of money, we split $28 in half:
- $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them $14.

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they made from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. So, we do:
\[ 300 \times 0.8 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much it cost them to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost $0.5. So, we do:
\[ 300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money they made in profit, we subtract the cost from the money they made:
\[ 240 - 150 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the class was able to raise 90 dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Well, let's see here. Larry's got 3 cats. He's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 dogs. He's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 minus 2, which is 7 rabbits. He's got a fish tank with 3 times the number of fish as rabbits, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 fish. He's also got gerbils, and he's got 1/3 the number of fish, so that's 21 divided by 3, which is 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add 'em all up:
- 3 cats
- 9 dogs
- 7 rabbits
- 21 fish
- 7 gerbils

So, 3 plus 9 plus 7 plus 21 plus 7 is 47.

Larry has 47 pets."
"Okay, let's think about this. Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so that's 4 slices a day for Josh. Together, they eat 2 slices plus 4 slices, which is 6 slices a day.

27 - 15 = 12 cups

These 12 cups are split into 3 rows. So, each row gets:

12 / 3 = 4 cups

In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, half of the 4 cups in each row are mint tea:

4 / 2 = 2 cups

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a simple person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, the sloth takes 4 hours to go down, get berries, and climb back up. If he has 8 hours to get 24 berries, he can only make 2 trips in that time because 8 divided by 4 is 2.

Now, if he needs 24 berries and he can only make 2 trips, he needs to get half of 24 berries on each trip. Half of 24 is 12.

So, the sloth needs to pick up 12 berries each time he goes down to the ground.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, there's a big pool with 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his dad take half of that water and put it in a tank. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 gallons. So, the tank starts with 5,000 gallons.

Now, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day to water their garden. We need to find out how much water is left after 6 days.

If they use 500 gallons a day, in 6 days they will use:
500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

So, they use 3,000 gallons in 6 days. We started with 5,000 gallons, so the amount left in the tank is:
5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water left in the tank.

"Okay, let's see here. Colby gets $150 a month for movies and snacks. He's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, which cost $10 each, and 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.

First, let's add up what he spent on the movies:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 times $10 is $50.
- 8 movies on other days: 8 times $7 is $56.

Now, let's add up what he spent on snacks:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 times $8 is $16.
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 times $2 is $8.

So, the total he spent so far is:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106.
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total spent: $106 + $24 = $130.

He started with $150, so he has:
- $150 - $130 = $20 left.

On the last day, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. That will cost:
- Movie ticket: $10.
- Popcorn: $8.
- Candy: $2.
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford this. So, he can see one more movie.

Adding this to the movies he's already seen:
- 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 movies.

So, Colby can see 14 movies in total this month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how many calories are in one of those little cinnamon rolls. A big one has 600 calories, and the little ones have 1/3 of that. So, we do:
600 ÷ 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll.

Next, we do the same for the blueberry muffins. A big muffin has 450 calories, and the little ones have 1/3 of that. So, we do:
450 ÷ 3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in all the mini cinnamon rolls. There are 200 of them, so we do:
200 rolls × 200 calories each = 40,000 calories.

Then, we do the same for the mini blueberry muffins. There are 300 of them, so we do:
300 muffins × 150 calories each = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins together:
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries is:
85,000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

On Monday, Rita picked 39 Junebugs. That's a good start!

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked twice as many as Monday. So, that's 39 times 2, which is 78 Junebugs each day. That's a lot!

On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs. Not as many as Tuesday and Wednesday, but still a bunch.

On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs. That's a big number too!

Now, let's add all these up:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

So, 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57. Let's do this step by step:
- 39 + 78 = 117
- 117 + 78 = 195
- 195 + 48 = 243
- 243 + 57 = 300

So, she picked a total of 300 Junebugs over the 5 days.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60."
"Okay, let's see. The bus goes 60 miles every hour and it travels for 5 hours. So, the bus goes 60 times 5, which is 300 miles.

The car goes 30 miles every hour and it travels for 8 hours. So, the car goes 30 times 8, which is 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went, we subtract the distance the car went from the distance the bus went. That's 300 miles minus 240 miles, which equals 60 miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

60"
"Okay, let's see. Sophie has a bunch of toys for her nephew. She's got 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. She bought some bouncy balls, and now she has 62 toys in total. We need to figure out how many bouncy balls she got.

First, let's add up the toys she already had:
31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 48 toys.

Now, she has 62 toys in total. So, the number of bouncy balls is:
62 total toys - 48 toys she already had = 14 bouncy balls.

So, Sophie got 14 bouncy balls.

14"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the same as Paul's and Jean's ages added together.

Let's call Jean's age ""J."" So, Paul's age would be ""J + 10"" because he's 10 years older than Jean.

Now, Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10.""

We also know that the total age of all three is 100, so:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Let's add it all up:
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find out what ""J"" is. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old. Now, let's find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is:
50"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Maria gives each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, that's:
4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

Maria keeps 1 balloon for herself, so now we have:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom comes out and gives each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so:
5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Now, we add the 15 balloons from Maria's mom to the 9 balloons they already had:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
24"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we got 10 people, and each one of them brings 5 boxes. So, that's:
10 people times 5 boxes each = 50 boxes.

Then, they already had 10 boxes sitting around. So, we add those:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes total.

Now, they can fit 2 boxes on each table. So, we need to figure out how many tables we need for 60 boxes:
60 boxes divided by 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more we need:
30 tables needed - 15 tables they have = 15 new tables.

So, they need 15 new tables.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, if you count 10 feet for each seed, it's like adding 10, 40 times. That's 400 feet total for Zoey.

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, if you count 12 feet for each seed, it's like adding 12, 35 times. That's 420 feet total for Sydney.

Now, to find the average, we add the total distances together and then divide by 2, because there are two people.

400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

820 feet ÷ 2 = 410 feet

So, the average total distance they both spit is 410 feet."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many widgets each machine can make in a month. 

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets every hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- It runs for 30 days in a month.
So, the total number of widgets it makes is:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets every hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- It runs for 30 days in a month.
So, the total number of widgets it makes is:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets.

Next, we need to find out how much money each machine makes. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400.

Now, to find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000.

64800"
"Okay, let's see. Cameron comes to the hotel at 5 in the evening and leaves at 10 in the morning the next day. That's 17 hours. The hotel says you can stay for 12 hours for 1000 pesos, or 24 hours for 1600 pesos. But if you want to stay more than 12 hours, you can pay 70 pesos for each extra hour.

So, for the first 12 hours, Cameron pays 1000 pesos. For the extra 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos for each hour. That's 5 times 70, which is 350 pesos.

So, Cameron pays 1000 pesos plus 350 pesos, which is 1350 pesos in total.

If he had paid for the 24-hour stay, it would have been 1600 pesos. So, the money he saves is 1600 pesos minus 1350 pesos, which is 250 pesos.

250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my chickens.

First, we need to know how much hay each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. If Nate has 15 goats, then:
15 goats × 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Next, we need to figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, twice what a goat needs is:
2 × 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
Then, 3 pounds less than that is:
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds per sheep.
If Nate has 12 sheep, then:
12 sheep × 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

Now, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep together:
75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds of hay.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Okay, let's see here. John makes 50 bucks an hour and works 6 hours, so he makes 300 bucks in a week. He spends 50 bucks on gas, so he has 250 bucks left. He wants to put 100 bucks in the bank, so he has 150 bucks left. He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 bucks each, so that's 50 bucks. Now he has 100 bucks left. Each pen costs 25 bucks, so he can buy 4 pens.

4"
"Okay, let's see here. Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, if we do the math, that's 20 times 15, which gives us 300 letters for Craig.

Now, his brother spelled out words that had 50 more letters in total than Craig. So, if Craig had 300 letters, his brother had 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.

To find out how many letters they both spelled out together, we just add Craig's 300 letters to his brother's 350 letters. That's 300 plus 350, which equals 650 letters.

So, the total number of letters they spelled out together is 650."
"Well, let's see. If there are 8 kids in each row and 7 rows for each school, that means each school has 8 times 7 kids, which is 56 kids. Now, if there are 5 schools, then we need to multiply 56 by 5. So, 56 times 5 is 280. 

So, there can be 280 kids in the drill.

280"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't been to school much.

So, the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon gets her 100 bottles of apple juice. That means she has 900 bottles of apple juice in total.

Now, there are 29 kids in the class, and each kid gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher gives out 29 times 2, which is 58 bottles of apple juice to the kids.

After giving the kids their apple juice, the teacher has 900 bottles minus the 58 bottles she gave out. That leaves her with 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Patty charges $40 just to come to your house. That's the visit fee.

Next, she charges $35 for each hour of work. The job took 2.25 hours. So, we need to multiply 2.25 by 35 to find out how much the labor costs:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Then, there's the cost of the parts, which is $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged a total of $178.75.

178.75"
"Okay, let's break this down simple-like.

James gets 10 new CDs. Each one costs $15. So, 10 times 15 is $150. But he gets them for 40% off. That means he only pays 60% of the price. 

To find 60% of $150, you do 150 times 0.60, which is $90. So, he pays $90 for all the CDs.

Then, he decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. So, he gets $40 back.

To find out how much he was out, you take the $90 he paid and subtract the $40 he got back. 

So, $90 minus $40 is $50.

James was out $50.

50"
"Okay, let's see here. Jen's got some stuff to sell. She's got 6 yams, and each yam sells for $1.5. So, for the yams, she'll make 6 times $1.5, which is $9.

Then, she's got 10 sweet potatoes, and each one of those sells for $2. So, for the sweet potatoes, she'll make 10 times $2, which is $20.

Lastly, she's got 4 carrots, and each carrot sells for $1.25. So, for the carrots, she'll make 4 times $1.25, which is $5.

Now, if we add all that up, $9 from the yams, $20 from the sweet potatoes, and $5 from the carrots, Jen will make $34 in total.

34"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. **First, how far does James swim before he stops?**
   - The lake is 20 miles long, and he swims 60% of it.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **How long does it take him to swim those 12 miles?**
   - He swims at 2 miles per hour.
   - So, it takes him \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) hours to swim 12 miles.

3. **How long does he rest?**
   - He rests for half as long as he swam.
   - Half of 6 hours is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) hours.

4. **How far does he have left to swim after resting?**
   - He has already swum 12 miles, so he has \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles left.

5. **How fast does he swim the remaining 8 miles?**
   - He swims at half his original speed, so he swims at \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **How long does it take him to swim the remaining 8 miles?**
   - At 1 mile per hour, it takes him \( 8 \div 1 = 8 \) hours to swim 8 miles.

7. **What's the total time it took him to get across the lake?**
   - He swam for 6 hours, rested for 3 hours, and then swam for 8 more hours.
   - Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

So, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, let's look at the New York Times:
- Each copy costs $5.
- I get 10% of that, which is 50 cents.
- If I sell 6 copies, I get 50 cents for each one, so that's 6 times 50 cents, which is $3.

Next, the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- I get 8% of that, which is $1.20.
- If I sell 10 copies, I get $1.20 for each one, so that's 10 times $1.20, which is $12.

Now, let's add it all up:
- From the New York Times, I get $3.
- From the Wall Street Journal, I get $12.
- So, in total, I get $3 + $12, which is $15.

So, the total commission I will earn is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. Bahati scored the most, and he scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar.

First, let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points. Then:
- Azibo scored \( B - 20 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( B - 10 \) points.

Now, we add up all their points:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Now, we add 30 to both sides to solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Then, we divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

So, Bahati scored 25 points. Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

So, Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes. That means he can staple 30 reports every quarter of an hour.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, that's 15 hours. Now, 15 hours is the same as 15 times 60 minutes, which is 900 minutes.

Now, if 15 minutes is one quarter of an hour, then in 900 minutes, there are 900 divided by 15, which is 60 quarters of an hour.

If Vince staples 30 reports in each of those 60 quarters, then he staples 30 times 60, which is 1800 reports.

So, Vince staples 1800 reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - That's 8 hours of sleep.
   - 8 hours is 480 minutes (because 8 times 60 is 480).

2. **Time Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - That's 23 minutes (because 38 minus 15 is 23).

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

4. **Total Time Lost:**
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time lost is 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time lost: 28 minutes.
   - So, the time she actually slept on the bed is 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Two dozen means 24 cups.

Now, he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we need to find 2/3 of 24:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]
So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the measuring cups to find the total number of utensils left:
\[ 24 \text{ cups} + 10 \text{ spoons} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
34"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

The hospital has 1000 beds. Right now, 1 out of every 5 beds is taken. So, if we split 1000 by 5, we get 200 beds that are already occupied.

Now, every day, 50 more people come in. We need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks. So, if 50 people come in each day for 14 days, that's 50 times 14, which is 700 more people.

So, after 2 weeks, the number of people in the hospital will be the 200 that were already there plus the 700 new ones. That's 200 plus 700, which is 900 people.

The hospital has 1000 beds, and if 900 are taken, then the number of empty beds is 1000 minus 900, which is 100.

So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 100.

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Now, two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. To find out how many that is, we do:
(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family

So, the number of emails left for her boyfriend is:
9 - 6 = 3 emails

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend. So, we do:

"Okay, let's think about this. Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly thinks Courtney added 20% more to the real number. So, if we take away that extra 20%, we can find out how many people were really there.

If 48 is 120% of the real number, then the real number is 100%. We can figure this out by dividing 48 by 1.2 (which is the same as 120%).

So, 48 divided by 1.2 is 40.

The real number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Okay, let's see. If Jason picked up 2 balls, and he picked up twice as many as Jeffrey, that means Jeffrey picked up 1 ball. Jordan picked up twice as many as Jason, so that's 4 balls. Now, if we add all the balls together: Jordan's 4, Jason's 2, and Jeffrey's 1, we get 7 balls in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, the pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. That's easy to remember.

On the second day, they dug 13 more holes. So, we add those:
10 + 13 = 23 holes so far.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 because they kept falling in. So, they really only added 6 new holes:
23 + 6 = 29 holes by the end of the third day.

Now, the problem says that by the end of the fourth day, there were four times as many holes as there were at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, four times that is:
4 × 10 = 40 holes.

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we need to see how many more holes there are by the end of the fourth day compared to the end of the third day:
40 - 29 = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Pokemon:** 339
2. **Alex's Pokemon:** Stan's Pokemon + 5

Let's call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught ""A."" Then:
- Stan's Pokemon = 4A - 13
- Alex's Pokemon = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8

Now, we add them all up:
- Adelwolfe's Pokemon + Stan's Pokemon + Alex's Pokemon = 339
- A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
- A + 4A + 4A - 13 - 8 = 339
- 9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
- 9A = 360

Divide by 9:
- A = 40

So, Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Now, let's find out how many Stan caught:
- Stan's Pokemon = 4A - 13
- Stan's Pokemon = 4(40) - 13
- Stan's Pokemon = 160 - 13
- Stan's Pokemon = 147

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Okay, let's see. Each episode is 20 minutes long. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode, so that's 10 episodes. If I watch all 10 episodes, and each is 20 minutes, then I'll spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about distances and directions.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. That's like driving a car for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. So, the bird covers:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Then, the bird turns around and flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's like driving a car for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, the bird covers:
\[ 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. That's like driving a car for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. So, the bird covers:
\[ 5 \times 22 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how far the bird is from its starting point, we need to add up the distances it flew south and subtract the distance it flew north:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. Greta made herself a batch of 12 brownies. That's 12 brownies.
2. Her office gave her half a dozen more. Half a dozen is 6, so that's 6 more brownies.
3. Her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies. Four dozen is 48, so that's 48 more brownies.

Now, let's add all these up:
12 (from Greta) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, they ate 1 and a half dozen brownies. One and a half dozen is 18 brownies.

So, we need to subtract the 18 brownies that were eaten:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day. 

48"
"Well, let's see. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that makes his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she's 2 years younger, so she's 6 years old. If we add all their ages together, that's 8 + 16 + 6, which gives us 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, for the racquets with synthetic gut:
- There are 3 racquets.
- It takes 15 minutes to string each one.
- So, 3 racquets times 15 minutes each is 45 minutes.

Next, for the racquets with polyester string:
- There are 5 racquets.
- It takes 22 minutes to string each one.
- So, 5 racquets times 22 minutes each is 110 minutes.

Finally, for the racquets with the hybrid set:
- There are 4 racquets.
- It takes 18 minutes to string each one.
- So, 4 racquets times 18 minutes each is 72 minutes.

Now, let's add all the times together:
- 45 minutes for synthetic gut
- 110 minutes for polyester string
- 72 minutes for hybrid set

Adding them up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

227"
"Okay, let's see. John is buying phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. That's 4 phones in total. Each phone costs $600, but after the first two, the price drops to half.

So, the first two phones cost:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600

That's $1200 for the first two.

The next two phones are half price:
- Third phone: $600 / 2 = $300
- Fourth phone: $600 / 2 = $300

So, the last two phones cost $300 each, which adds up to $600.

Now, let's add it all together:
- First two phones: $1200
- Last two phones: $600

Total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones. 

1800"
"Okay, let's see. Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so that means Zeke's team has 20 players. If we add the players from both teams together, we get 13 plus 20, which is 33. So, there are 33 players in total.

33"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Robert is building a fence around his garden. The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. To find out how much fencing he needs, we need to add up all the sides. 

So, we have:
- Two sides that are 15 feet long
- Two sides that are 10 feet wide

Adding these up:
- 15 + 15 = 30 feet for the long sides
- 10 + 10 = 20 feet for the short sides

Now, add the long sides and the short sides together:
- 30 + 20 = 50 feet of fencing

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total feet of fencing by 2:
- 50 feet × 2 = 100 wood slats

So, Robert will need 100 wood slats.

100"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away 4 boxes in total. That means she had:

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes left.

Then, she kept 1/4 of the oranges for herself. So, she kept:

1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes.

That means she sold the rest of the boxes. The rest of the boxes are:

8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so the number of oranges she sold is:

6 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 120 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. 

120"
"Okay, let's see. The USA has 50 states, right? Now, India has 4 more than half of that. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29. So, India has 29 states. If we add the states of both countries together, that's 50 plus 29, which gives us 79 states in total.

"Okay, let's see. Tyler wants to buy a dictionary for $18, a dinosaur book for $13, and a cookbook for $8. That's a total of:

18 + 13 + 8 = 39 dollars.

He already has 14 dollars saved up. So, he still needs:

39 - 14 = 25 dollars.

If Tyler earns 5 dollars for each hour he works, he needs to work:

25 / 5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to get enough money for the books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. The problem says he has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, if Robert has 30 cherries, Richard must have:

30 - 10 = 20 cherries

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. If Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, together they have:

30 + 20 = 50 cherries

That means Jerry must have the rest of the cherries. So, Jerry has:

60 - 50 = 10 cherries

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

30 - 10 = 20

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up all the boxes he sold over the two days:
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we need to figure out how much money he made. Each box of gingerbread costs $6, and each box of apple pie costs $15.

For the gingerbread:
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

For the apple pie:
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Now, let's add up the total money he made:
- $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

465"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She's outside for 4 hours each day. So, she uses 1 ounce times 4 hours, which is 4 ounces a day.

She's on vacation for 8 days. So, she needs 4 ounces a day times 8 days, which is 32 ounces in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen has 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle. So, 32 ounces divided by 8 ounces per bottle is 4 bottles.

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Okay, so if the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper, that means the red car costs 60% of what the blue car costs. 

60% of $100 is $60. So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find out how much both cars cost together, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
$100 + $60 = $160

So, both cars together cost $160."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

1. **Emil's age now:** Emil is 19 years old.
2. **Emil's age in 5 years:** When Emil turns 24, that's 5 years from now.
3. **Emil's dad's age in 5 years:** When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. **Emil's dad's current age:** Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, he is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.
5. **Emil's brother's age in 5 years:** When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, Emil's brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
6. **Emil's brother's current age:** Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, he is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.
7. **Sum of their ages now:** Emil's dad is 43 years old, and Emil's brother is 7 years old. So, the sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Adrianne got 20 shiny beads from her mom. Her sister, bein' nice, gave her 10 more than her mom did, so that's 30 beads. Her friend, tryin' to outdo 'em all, gave her twice what her mom gave, so that's 40 beads. Now, if we put all them beads together, we got 20 from her mom, 30 from her sister, and 40 from her friend. That's 20 + 30 + 40, which adds up to 90 beads. So, Adrianne ended up with 90 beads altogether.

"Okay, let's see here. On Thursday, Joe got 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he got 4 times that, so that's 12 pounds. On Saturday, he got half of what he got on Friday, so that's 6 pounds. 

Now, let's add it all up: 3 pounds on Thursday, 12 pounds on Friday, and 6 pounds on Saturday. That's 21 pounds total.

If one serving is 3 pounds, then we divide 21 by 3 to find out how many servings he has. 

21 divided by 3 is 7.

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"Okay, let's see here. In Mr. Roper's class, there are 30 students. Now, 20% of them are football players. That means 20 out of 100, so if we take 20% of 30, it's 6 students who are football players.

Now, we have 30 students minus the 6 football players, which leaves us with 24 students. Out of these 24, 25% are cheerleaders or in the band. So, 25 out of 100, if we take 25% of 24, it's 6 more students.

So, we have 6 football players and 6 cheerleaders or band members. Add those together, and that's 12 students in total who are leaving early.

"Okay, let's think about this. Sophie's boots are size 5. Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's, so that means Charlie's boots are 25. To find the average, we add the two sizes together and then divide by 2. So, 5 plus 25 is 30. Then, 30 divided by 2 is 15. 

So, the average size of the boots is 15."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many plants can fit in Pat's flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 1 foot wide, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet of space between each plant. So, each plant and the space it needs take up 2.5 feet.

To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:
111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy:
44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"Well, let's see. If Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, and his brother eats half as many, that means his brother eats 9 pretzels a day. Now, to figure out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we just need to count how many days are in a week and multiply that by 9. There are 7 days in a week, so:

9 pretzels a day times 7 days equals 63 pretzels.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how much it costs to fill one basket. 

- For the petunias: 3 petunias at $3.00 each. So, 3 times 3 is 9 dollars.
- For the sweet potato vines: 2 vines at $2.50 each. So, 2 times 2.50 is 5 dollars.

Now, add those together: 9 dollars for the petunias and 5 dollars for the vines. That's 14 dollars to fill one basket.

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill. So, we need to multiply the cost of one basket by 5.

- 14 dollars times 5 is 70 dollars.

So, Katherine will spend 70 dollars to fill all 5 baskets.

"Okay, let's see here. We got a 30-pound bag of soil. 

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds, and they plant 4 of them. So, that's 3 pounds times 4, which is 12 pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and they plant 10 of them. So, that's 1.5 pounds times 10, which is 15 pounds.

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds plus 15 pounds, which is 27 pounds.

We started with 30 pounds of soil, so we have 30 pounds minus 27 pounds, which leaves us with 3 pounds of soil.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, with 3 pounds left, we can plant 3 roses.

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, let's see. Jessica makes $2,000 a month. She saves a quarter of that for fancy shoes. So, a quarter of $2,000 is $500. She saves $500 every month for shoes.

Now, if she saves $500 every month, in a year, which is 12 months, she saves $500 times 12, which is $6,000.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. So, with $6,000, she can buy $6,000 divided by $1,000, which is 6 pairs of shoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Emily can peel 6 shrimp in one minute. If she needs to peel 90 shrimp, we need to figure out how many minutes that will take. 

90 shrimp divided by 6 shrimp per minute is:
90 / 6 = 15 minutes

So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel all the shrimp.

Next, she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we need to see how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp.

90 shrimp divided by 30 shrimp per set is:
90 / 30 = 3 sets

Each set takes 10 minutes to cook, so 3 sets will take:
3 sets * 10 minutes per set = 30 minutes

So, it takes her 30 minutes to cook all the shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:
15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, the air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees every hour on low. It runs on low for 3 hours, so it cools the room by:
2 degrees/hour × 3 hours = 6 degrees

Next, the air conditioner is turned up to high, and it cools the room 3 degrees every hour. It runs on high for 4 hours, so it cools the room by:
3 degrees/hour × 4 hours = 12 degrees

So far, the room has cooled by:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Then, the air conditioner is turned off, and the room starts to warm up. It warms up 2 degrees every hour, and it warms up for 2 hours, so it warms up by:
2 degrees/hour × 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we need to find out how much the temperature has changed overall. The room cooled by 18 degrees and then warmed up by 4 degrees, so the net change is:
18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill was 3 times 30, which is 90 years old.
3. The comet comes back every 75 years. So, if Bill was 90 years old when he saw it the second time, he must have seen it the first time 75 years earlier.
4. If we take 75 years away from 90, we get 15.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Well, let's see. Buford writes a check for the electric bill every month, that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month, that's another 12 checks. Then, he writes 2 checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, which is 4 times a year, so that's 4 more checks.

Now, if we add all these up: 12 for the electric, 12 for the gas, 24 for the church, and 4 for the pest and lawn service, we get:

12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

So, Buford writes 52 checks a year."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, there are two planes at the airport. The first plane flies to Greece for most of its trips, but it also flies to France and Germany. The second plane only flies to Poland, and it makes 44 trips a day. These 44 trips are only half the number of trips the first plane makes.

First, let's figure out how many trips the first plane makes. If 44 trips are half of what the first plane does, then the first plane must make:
\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips} \]

Now, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. So, the number of trips to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips} \]

That leaves one-quarter of the trips for France and Germany. Since these remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany, each gets half of the remaining quarter:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \text{ trips} \]
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ trips to France} \]

So, the first plane makes 11 trips to France in one day.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 20 seconds times 2, which is 40 seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. So, we add Tobias' 20 seconds and Chikote's 40 seconds, which gives us 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up all the time they howl:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total time they howl together is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 120 seconds by 60 to get the total time in minutes:
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

We know the total age of all four kids is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, if we add Akbar and Alessandro's ages, we get:
3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find out the ages of Helene and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, let's figure out the average age of the group. Since the total age is 20 and there are 4 kids, the average age is:
20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, Helene is twice as old as 5, which means:
5 × 2 = 10

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We already have the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
3 + 4 + 10 = 17

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the total of the other three kids' ages from the total age of the group:
20 - 17 = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church. Half of 1500 is 750 cookies.

Now, if each person at the church got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people that is. We do this by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. So, 750 divided by 15 is 50.

So, 50 people got cookies at the church.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who hasn't gone to school much. We've got a watermelon, and we need to share it among 6 people: 2 grown-ups and 4 kids. The grown-ups get slices that are twice as big as the kids' slices.

First, let's imagine the watermelon is cut into 8 equal parts. If each kid gets 1 part, then each grown-up should get 2 parts because their slices are twice as big.

So, each grown-up gets 2 parts out of the 8 parts. To find out what percentage that is, we can do a simple calculation:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of parts each grown-up gets}}{\text{Total number of parts}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each grown-up gets 25% of the watermelon.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Doctor Jones has to do rounds for 9 inpatients. Each round takes 20 minutes. So, 9 inpatients times 20 minutes each is 180 minutes. That's 3 hours, because 180 minutes divided by 60 minutes in an hour is 3 hours.

Next, he has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, 10 appointments times 30 minutes each is 300 minutes. That's 5 hours, because 300 minutes divided by 60 minutes in an hour is 5 hours.

Now, let's add the time for rounds and appointments together: 3 hours for rounds plus 5 hours for appointments is 8 hours.

Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours. If he spends 8 hours on rounds and appointments, he has 1 hour left to update his records.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Jordan wants to make a cake for her mom's birthday. She needs to:
- Make the batter, which takes 20 minutes.
- Bake the cake, which takes 30 minutes.
- Let the cake cool, which takes 2 hours.
- Frost the cake, which takes 10 minutes.

First, let's add up all the time she needs:
- 20 minutes for the batter
- 30 minutes for baking
- 2 hours for cooling (which is 120 minutes)
- 10 minutes for frosting

So, 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. If she needs 3 hours to make the cake, she should start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

So, 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"Okay, let's think about this. Lisa and Peter sold chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

If we add up the boxes they sold, that's 3.5 boxes plus 4.5 boxes, which equals 8 boxes in total. So, 8 boxes of chocolate bars equal 64 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, the studio costs $25 to rent each time. They rent it 3 times a week. So, for the week, that's:
$25 * 3 = $75

Next, for each student, it costs $1.50 per session. There are 10 students, and they have 3 sessions a week. So, for the students each week, that's:
$1.50 * 10 students * 3 sessions = $45

Now, add the cost of renting the studio and the cost for the students for one week:
$75 + $45 = $120

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost for the month is:
$120 * 4 = $480

So, the expected cost for the dance studio in a month is $480.

480"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

Peter has 4 boxes, and all together, he has 64 chocolate bars. If we split 64 chocolate bars equally into 4 boxes, we do 64 divided by 4. That's 16 chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

Martha has 7 boxes, and all together, she has 56 chocolate bars. If we split 56 chocolate bars equally into 7 boxes, we do 56 divided by 7. That's 8 chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box. So, 16 minus 8 equals 8.

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know there are 50 porcupines in the park. Out of these, 3 out of every 5 porcupines are female. So, to find out how many female porcupines there are, we do:

50 porcupines * 3/5 = 30 female porcupines.

Now, each of these female porcupines has 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

30 female porcupines * 4 babies = 120 babies per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

120 babies/month * 12 months = 1440 babies in a year.

Finally, to find out how many porcupines there will be in the park after a year, we add the number of babies born in a year to the original number of porcupines:

50 original porcupines + 1440 babies = 1490 porcupines.

So, after a year, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park.

1490"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

First, we need to find out how much water the pool can hold. The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To get the volume, we multiply these numbers together:

14 feet (width) x 25 feet (length) x 4 feet (depth) = 1400 cubic feet

Next, the pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water we need:

1400 cubic feet x 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Now, the cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

8260 gallons x $0.10 per gallon = $826

So, it will cost $826 to fill the pool."
"Okay, let's see here. They got 9 red sticks. Now, they said there are 5 more blue sticks than red ones, so that means there are 14 blue sticks. Then, the yellow sticks are 3 less than the blue ones, so that's 11 yellow sticks. If we add all these up: 9 red, 14 blue, and 11 yellow, we get 34 sticks in total.

34"
"Okay, let's see here. Matteo was driving at 55 miles an hour for 4 hours. So, if you do the math, that's 55 times 4, which gives you 220 miles. Shandy was driving at 45 miles an hour for 10 hours. So, 45 times 10 is 450 miles. Now, to find out how much farther Shandy drove, you take Shandy's miles and subtract Matteo's miles. That's 450 minus 220, which equals 230 miles. So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

230"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting apples.

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so that's 1500 students.
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so that's 1500 divided by 4, which is 375 male students.
4. The rest of the students over 16 are female, so that's 1500 minus 375, which is 1125 female students.
5. The other half of the students are under 16, so that's also 1500 students.
6. Half of the students under 16 are male, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 male students.
7. The rest of the students under 16 are female, so that's 1500 minus 750, which is 750 female students.
8. Now, we add the female students over 16 and under 16 together: 1125 plus 750, which is 1875.

So, the total number of female students at the school is 1875."
"Okay, let's see here. Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so that's 14 laps for Trey. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so that's 7 laps for Shaelyn. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 5 laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we just subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps. So, 10 laps minus 5 laps equals 5 laps.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we need to know how much water Wanda and Ms. B put in the tank on the first day.

1. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. The tank holds 18,000 gallons, so:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda did on the first day:
   \[
   \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, on the first day, they put in:
   \[
   4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Next, let's see how much they put in on the second day.

3. Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did on the first day:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she did on the first day:
   \[
   \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, on the second day, they put in:
   \[
   3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the water they put in over the two days:
   \[
   7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

The tank holds 18,000 gallons, so the amount of water still needed to fill the tank is:
   \[
   18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the tank still needs 6,000 gallons of water to be full."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Maria's power bank was losing charge while her friends were using it. First, it lost 9% of its total charge each hour for 5 hours. Then, it lost 7% of its total charge each hour for 3 more hours. In the end, the power bank had 28% charge left.

1. **Last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% each hour for 3 hours.
   - If it had 28% left after these 3 hours, we need to figure out how much it had before these 3 hours.
   - Each hour, it lost 7%, so it kept 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge.
   - So, if 28% is what was left after 3 hours, we can work backwards:
     \[
     \text{Charge before last 3 hours} = \frac{28\%}{0.93^3}
     \]
   - Calculating \(0.93^3\):
     \[
     0.93^3 \approx 0.804
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     \text{Charge before last 3 hours} = \frac{28\%}{0.804} \approx 34.8\%
     \]

2. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% each hour for 5 hours.
   - If it had 34.8% left after these 5 hours, we need to figure out how much it had before these 5 hours.
   - Each hour, it lost 9%, so it kept 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge.
   - So, if 34.8% is what was left after 5 hours, we can work backwards:
     \[
     \text{Charge before first 5 hours} = \frac{34.8\%}{0.91^5}
     \]
   - Calculating \(0.91^5\):
     \[
     0.91^5 \approx 0.590
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     \text{Charge before first 5 hours} = \frac{34.8\%}{0.590} \approx 58.9\%
     \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was about 58.9%.

58.9%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Janet wants to save up for a car that costs $10,000. She needs to save 20% of that for a down payment. So, 20% of $10,000 is:
\[ 10,000 \times 0.20 = 2,000 \]

Next, Janet makes $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour in tips. So, every hour she works, she makes:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

If she works 40 hours a week, her total earnings for the week are:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \]

Now, to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs by her weekly earnings:
\[ 2,000 \div 1,000 = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"Okay, let's see here. Jamaar's got $10 to spend at the store. He's already bought some fruits:

- 3 peaches at 50 cents each, that's $1.50.
- 4 pears at 50 cents each, that's $2.00.
- 2 kiwis at $1 each, that's $2.00.
- 5 apples at 75 cents each, that's $3.75.

Now, let's add up what he's spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

He started with $10, so he's got $0.75 left. Plums cost 25 cents each, so he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Okay, let's see. Anne had a box with 15 packs of sweets, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 13 packs. If each pack has 60 pieces, then 13 packs have 13 times 60 pieces, which is 780 pieces. She gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends, so each friend got 780 divided by 10, which is 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends got 78 pieces of sweets."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to a friend.

So, Mrs. Tatiana's carrots start at $120. Every year, the price goes up by 5%. We need to find out what the price will be after three years.

First year:
- The price goes up by 5% of $120.
- 5% of $120 is $120 * 0.05 = $6.
- So, the new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Second year:
- The price goes up by 5% of $126.
- 5% of $126 is $126 * 0.05 = $6.30.
- So, the new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Third year:
- The price goes up by 5% of $132.30.
- 5% of $132.30 is $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615.
- So, the new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Now, we need to round $138.915 to the nearest whole number. That gives us $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

139"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

So, Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, and she put the same number of pictures in each album. That means each album has 9 pictures, because 72 divided by 8 is 9.

Now, 3 of these albums are all selfies, so that's 3 albums times 9 pictures each, which gives us 27 selfies.

Then, 2 of the albums are portraits, so that's 2 albums times 9 pictures each, which gives us 18 portraits.

To find out how many selfies and portraits she had in total, we add the selfies and the portraits together: 27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures.

So, Olivia had 45 selfies and portraits in total.

45"
"Okay, let's think about this. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. If he reads 18 pages, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages. 

18 pages divided by 3 pages per set is 6 sets. Since each set takes 10 minutes, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes:

6 sets * 10 minutes = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests left early, so we take away 24 from 100. That leaves us with 76 guests.
3. Then, 15 more guests left later. We take away 15 from 76. That leaves us with 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who left late. Since 15 people left late, twice that is 30. So, we add 30 to 61. That gives us 91 guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in. We add 7 to 91. That gives us 98 guests.

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. **Total Questions:**
   - There are 60 questions in the quiz.

2. **Easy Questions:**
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - So, 40% of 60 is 0.40 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

3. **Average and Difficult Questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are split equally between average and difficult.
   - Total remaining questions = 60 - 24 = 36
   - So, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

4. **Questions Aries Gets Correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - 75% of 24 is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.
   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - Half of 18 is 0.50 * 18 = 9 average questions correct.
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Half of 18 is 0.50 * 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.

5. **Total Correct Questions:**
   - Total correct questions = 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 questions correct.

"Okay, let's think about this. Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times what she sells the small ones for. She sold twice as many small ones as big ones today and made $120 in total. Each small one costs $4.

If a small one is $4, then a big one must be $12 because it's three times as much.

Now, if she sold twice as many small ones as big ones, let's say she sold 1 big one. That means she sold 2 small ones. But we need to find out how many she actually sold to make $120.

If she sold 1 big one for $12 and 2 small ones for $4 each, that's $12 + $8 = $20.

To make $120, we need to see how many times $20 fits into $120. That's $120 ÷ $20 = 6.

So, she sold 6 big ones and 12 small ones (since it's twice as many small ones as big ones).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Okay, let's see. The man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the wife eats 4, and the little one eats 2. So, all together, they eat 11 sandwiches each day. Now, if we want to know how many they eat in a week, we just need to count how many days are in a week and multiply that by 11. There are 7 days in a week, so:

11 sandwiches a day times 7 days is 77 sandwiches.

To figure out how many eggs the friends found, we take the total number of eggs, which is 100, and subtract the 60 eggs the twins found and the 10 eggs that weren't found. 

So, 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we need to know how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe. 

- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 24 pounds.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is 12 pounds, and 24 pounds plus 12 pounds is 36 pounds.

So, one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore in a day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, if we have 40 dwarves, each mining 36 pounds a day, that's:
\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

If they work for 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:
\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.

43200"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own. We got three different packages of sandwiches, and we need to find out how much the biggest one costs.

First, we look at the small package. It has 2 sandwiches and costs $3. That means each sandwich costs $1.50.

Next, we look at the medium package. It has 4 sandwiches and costs $6. If we divide $6 by 4, we get $1.50 per sandwich again. So, the price is the same for each sandwich in both packages.

Now, for the big package with 8 sandwiches, if each sandwich still costs $1.50, we just need to multiply 8 by $1.50.

8 sandwiches × $1.50 per sandwich = $12

So, the big package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"Okay, let's see. Tom bought a new bedroom set for $3000. He sold his old one and got $1000. So, he still needs to pay $2000 for the new set. Now, he has to pay 10% of that $2000 every month. 

To figure out 10% of $2000, you just move the decimal point one place to the left. So, 10% of $2000 is $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 every month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Sally had 25 red balloons. A gust of wind made 40% of them pop. That's like saying 4 out of every 10 balloons popped. So, 40% of 25 is 10. That means 10 red balloons popped, and she was left with:

25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, she had 12 yellow balloons, but she accidentally let go of half of them. Half of 12 is 6, so she let go of 6 and was left with:

12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

She also had 7 green balloons, and none of them were affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree. She added 75% of them to her bunch. Seventy-five percent is like 3 out of every 4, so 75% of 8 is 6. She added 6 blue balloons to her bunch.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she had left:

15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.

So, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Marcus has a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will come in, and if that happens, he doesn't have to turn in his homework. That's pretty good, right?

Now, if the normal teacher comes in (which is the other 50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance Marcus doesn't have to turn it in. That's 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 40% (chance of extension), which is 20%.

But even if the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (which is 60% of the time when she's there), Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate his homework. So, that's 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 60% (no extension) times 20% (dog ate it), which is 6%.

Now, let's add up all the times Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (normal teacher gives an extension)
- 6% (normal teacher, no extension, but dog ate it)

So, 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

That means there's a 76% chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. So, the chance he does have to turn it in is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, we need to know how many seats are left for the friends and family after the graduates and faculty get their seats. The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. The graduates take 950 seats, and the faculty takes 300 seats. So, we do the math:

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left for friends and family.

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"Well, let's see. If Grandpa can eat 75 big jelly beans, and he can eat twice as many medium ones, that means he can eat 150 medium jelly beans. Now, if 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium one, then we just need to multiply the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small ones he can eat. So, 150 times 3 is 450. Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting pennies in a jar.

First, Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. So, she spends:
6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, she gets paid $15 per day for 3 days. So, she earns:
$15/day * 3 days = $45

But, she also has to pay for parking, which costs her $3 per day for 3 days. So, her parking costs are:
$3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, we need to find out how much she has left after paying for parking. We subtract the parking costs from her total earnings:
$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide the money she has left by the total number of hours she worked:
$36 / 18 hours = $2

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Okay, let's see. Ted starts with 200 dollars. He buys 3 books, each costing 16 dollars, so that's 3 times 16, which is 48 dollars. Then, he buys 3 pencils, each costing 6 dollars, so that's 3 times 6, which is 18 dollars. Adding 48 and 18 together, Ted spent 66 dollars in total.

Now, Richard starts at the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. He has to go from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th. That's 7 moves.

If each move takes 5 seconds, then 7 moves will take:
7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"Well, let's see. Uncle Franky got two boxes of apples, and each box has forty apples. So, he's got eighty apples in total. If he wants to put eight apples in each pack, we just need to figure out how many times eight goes into eighty. That's ten times. So, he can make ten packs of apples.

"Okay, let's see. Parmesan cheese costs $11 a pound, and Mozzarella cheese costs $6 a pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of Mozzarella.

First, for the Parmesan:
2 pounds at $11 each is 2 times 11, which is $22.

Next, for the Mozzarella:
3 pounds at $6 each is 3 times 6, which is $18.

Now, add the costs together:
$22 for the Parmesan plus $18 for the Mozzarella is $40.

Amor starts with $50. After buying the cheese, she has:
$50 minus $40, which leaves her with $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

Jim went to college for 4 years. Each year, he got $50,000 in loans. So, the total loans he got are:
\[ 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \]

While he was in college, he couldn't work at his old job that paid $25,000 a year. So, the money he lost by not working is:
\[ 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \]

Now, the total amount of money Jim needs to make up is the loans plus the money he lost:
\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

After college, Jim's income tripled. His old job paid $25,000, so his new job pays:
\[ 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new job, we divide the total amount by his new yearly income:
\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"Well, let's see. Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric needs to be 8 feet long (6 + 2) and 10 feet wide (8 + 2).

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length by the width. So, 8 feet times 10 feet is 80 square feet for one piece. Since he needs two pieces, we multiply 80 square feet by 2, which gives us 160 square feet.

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. 

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my chickens.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. That's a lot of letters!

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of what they delivered on Monday. So, one-fifth of 425 is 85. Add 17 to 85, and you get 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice what they delivered on Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204. Add 5 to 204, and you get 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up all the letters from Monday to Wednesday:
- Monday: 425
- Tuesday: 102
- Wednesday: 209

425 + 102 + 209 = 736

So, the post office delivered 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.

"Okay, let's see. Molly's got 16 people coming to the party. Ten of them want chicken salad, and that costs $6.50 for each person. Six of them want pasta salad, and that's $6 for each person.

First, let's figure out the chicken salad:
10 people times $6.50 each is $65.

Next, the pasta salad:
6 people times $6 each is $36.

Now, we add both costs together:
$65 plus $36 is $101.

So, Molly will pay $101 for the catering.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5. That's a simple loss.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race.
   - Twice what he lost in the first race is $10 (because 2 times 5 is 10).
   - So, he won $11 (because 10 plus 1 is 11).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - So, he lost $16.5 (because 1.5 times 11 is 16.5).

Now, let's add up the total losses:
- First race: $5
- Third race: $16.5
- Total loss: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 per race that day.

7.17"
"Okay, let's see. There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, that's 26 times 5, which gives us 130 cities. Now, if each city has 1000 people, then we need to multiply 130 by 1000. That's 130,000 people. So, there are 130,000 people in South America.

130000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're talking to someone who doesn't know much about math.

First, we need to know how tall Xavier and Cole are now after they grew over the summer.

Xavier:
- He was 4 feet tall.
- 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet is 4 times 12, which is 48 inches.
- He grew 3 inches, so we add 3 to 48, which gives us 51 inches.

Cole:
- He was 50 inches tall.
- He grew 2 inches, so we add 2 to 50, which gives us 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between their heights:
- Cole is 52 inches tall.
- Xavier is 51 inches tall.
- The difference is 52 minus 51, which is 1 inch.

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch. 

1 inch"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have three people splitting $1920. The second person takes $80 more than the first, and the third person takes twice what the second person takes.

Let's call the amount the first person gets ""x.""

So, the second person gets ""x + 80.""

The third person gets ""2 times (x + 80),"" which is ""2x + 160.""

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total of $1920:

x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Now, subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So, the first person gets $420.

420"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. First, we need to know how many days the painters worked. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, 3 weeks times 7 days is 21 days.
2. Now, each day they only worked for 3/8 of the day. A full day has 24 hours, so 3/8 of 24 hours is 9 hours. This means they worked 9 hours each day.
3. To find out how many hours they worked in total, we multiply the number of days by the hours they worked each day. So, 21 days times 9 hours is 189 hours.
4. Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked. So, 189 hours divided by 4 painters is 47.25 hours.

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out on my own.

Rory picked up some tennis balls after a match. He picked up more balls in the first set than in the second, and fewer in the third. In total, he picked up 19 balls.

Let's say he picked up \( x \) balls in the second set. Then, in the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls, and in the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

So, the total number of balls is:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve this step by step. First, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying everything by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory picked up 6 balls. In the first set, he picked up:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who doesn't know much about math.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The car loses value every year by 21%. We need to find out how much the car is worth in 2010, which is 3 years later.

1. **First Year:**
   - The car loses 21% of its value.
   - 21% of $20,000 is \( 0.21 \times 20000 = 4200 \).
   - So, the car is worth \( 20000 - 4200 = 15800 \) after the first year.

2. **Second Year:**
   - Now the car is worth $15,800.
   - The car loses 21% of $15,800.
   - 21% of $15,800 is \( 0.21 \times 15800 = 3318 \).
   - So, the car is worth \( 15800 - 3318 = 12482 \) after the second year.

3. **Third Year:**
   - Now the car is worth $12,482.
   - The car loses 21% of $12,482.
   - 21% of $12,482 is \( 0.21 \times 12482 = 2621.22 \).
   - So, the car is worth \( 12482 - 2621.22 = 9860.78 \) after the third year.

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

9860.78"
"Okay, let's see. There are 50 books in total. Half of them, which is 25, are in English. Then, 10% of 50, which is 5, are in German. So, if we take away the English and German books, we have 50 - 25 - 5, which leaves us with 20 books in Spanish.

"Okay, so if Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, that means she drove a total of 1300 kilometers. The whole trip from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. So, to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we take the total distance and subtract what she's already driven:

1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

655"
"Okay, let's see. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. There are 16 cups in a gallon. So, in one day, she drinks half a gallon. Over 30 days, that's 30 times half a gallon.

3. At the second stop, 50 people get off, and twice that number (which is 100) get on. So now there are:

"Okay, let's see here. Alison went shopping for some running stuff. She bought:

- A tank top for $10.
- Running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15.
- Tennis shoes that were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so that's $48 / 2 = $24.
- A pair of athletic socks that cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so that's $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

So, $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"Okay, let's figure this out. If my kitchen floor is 200 square feet and each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, that means each tile covers 1 square foot. So, I need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor. If each tile costs $12, then I just need to multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile. 

200 tiles times $12 per tile equals $2400.

So, it will cost me $2400 to renovate my kitchen floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm explaining it to someone who's never done math like this before.

James has to pay more for his insurance because he had an accident. The normal cost is $120 a month. But now, he has to pay 60% more.

First, we need to find out what 60% of $120 is. To do that, we take 120 and multiply it by 0.60 (which is the same as 60%).

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the extra amount he has to pay each month is $72.

Now, we add that extra amount to the normal cost to find out the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, James now pays $192 each month.

To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Greg has to put clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His washing machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

First, let's figure out how many loads he does each week:
- For the 4 twin beds, he needs to do 2 loads because the machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time.
- For the 1 king size bed, he needs to do 1 load because the machine can only wash 1 king set at a time.

So, each week, he does 2 loads for the twin beds and 1 load for the king bed, which is 3 loads in total.

Now, let's figure out how many loads he does in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- If he does 3 loads each week, then in a year he does:
  3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"Well, let's see. On Saturdays, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. On Sundays, they watch half as many, so that's 2 movies. So, in one weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, which adds up to 6 movies.

Now, if they do this every weekend for 4 weeks, we just need to multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4. So, 6 movies times 4 weeks is 24 movies.

So, they can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this. Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of food each, twice a day. So, for one feeding, all the cats together eat 180 grams (60 grams times 3 cats). Since they eat twice a day, that's 360 grams a day (180 grams times 2 feedings).

Now, if Imma has 720 grams of cat food, we need to figure out how many days that will last. We take the total amount of food, 720 grams, and divide it by how much they eat in a day, 360 grams. 

720 divided by 360 is 2.

So, the food will last for 2 days.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza has 8 slices, so that's 32 slices in total.

Becky ate 10 slices. The problem says Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake must have eaten 7 slices (because 10 - 3 = 7).

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 14 slices (because 7 x 2 = 14).

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31

So, they ate 31 slices in total.

If we split the time evenly, it would be 49 minutes each, but Betsy took 18 minutes more. So, if we take 18 minutes and split it between them, that means Donovan took 40 minutes and Betsy took 58 minutes.

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down simple-like.

1. The cast costs $200.
2. The doctor's visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doc charges $300 for a full hour, so for half an hour, it's $150.
3. The painkillers cost $4 each, and she gets 30 of them. So, 30 times 4 is $120.
4. Parking is $6 an hour, and she has to park for at least 2 hours. So, 2 times 6 is $12.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Cast: $200
- Visit: $150
- Painkillers: $120
- Parking: $12

Total: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

To find out how many emails need a reply each day, I'll do this:
80 emails a day, and 80% of them need a reply. So, 80 times 0.80 equals 64 emails that need a reply each day.

Now, if he works 5 days a week, I just need to multiply the number of emails he replies to each day by 5:
64 emails a day times 5 days equals 320 emails.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, the glee club:
- They ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them. So, 70% of 20 is 14 pizzas.
- That means they left 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas.

Next, the football team:
- They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them. So, 80% of 40 is 32 pizzas.
- That means they left 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.

Now, let's add the pizzas left by both groups:
- Glee club left 6 pizzas.
- Football team left 8 pizzas.
- Total pizzas left: 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

First, Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. He wants to send out twice as many big coupons, so that's:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Now, each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, for 700 small coupons, the cost is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage.

"Okay, let me think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks to deliver fertiliser. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. That's a lot of fertiliser!

Now, I heard that some of the trucks had problems. A quarter of the trucks broke down. So, if 20 trucks were sent out, a quarter of 20 is 5 trucks. That means 5 trucks couldn't make it to the farmers.

If 5 trucks couldn't make it, then the rest of the trucks, which is 20 - 5, did make it. So, 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

Each of these 15 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, to find out how much fertiliser made it to the farmers, I need to multiply the number of trucks that made it by the amount of fertiliser each truck was carrying.

15 trucks \(\times\) 20 tons per truck = 300 tons of fertiliser.

So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 300 tons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The store has a deal: buy one pound of butter, get the next one at half price. The butter costs $4.00 a pound.

So, for every two pounds:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds, we can think of it as 3 sets of 2 pounds:
- First set: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
- Second set: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
- Third set: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Now, add up the costs for all three sets:
- Total cost = $6.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

So, Dennis will need to spend $18.00 to buy 6 pounds of butter.

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so:
45 - 4 = 41 people are coming to the party.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people. For each extra person, it's $6 more.

So, we have 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

For these 21 extra people, it's 21 * $6 = $126.

$125 + $126 = $251.

So, the party will cost $251.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, and that's enough for his three monkeys for a whole week. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas every day. So, in a week, that monkey eats:
10 bananas/day × 7 days = 70 bananas

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
14 bananas/day (10 + 4) × 7 days = 98 bananas

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats. First, let's see how many bananas the first two monkeys eat together in a week:
70 bananas (first monkey) + 98 bananas (second monkey) = 168 bananas

So, the total number of bananas left for the third monkey is:
315 bananas (total) - 168 bananas (first and second monkeys) = 147 bananas

The third monkey eats these 147 bananas over 7 days, so each day the third monkey eats:
147 bananas ÷ 7 days = 21 bananas/day

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Well, let me think about this. Teddy did half of one puzzle, that's 250 pieces, right? Then he did a whole other puzzle, that's 500 pieces. So, if you add those up, 250 and 500, that makes 750 pieces. 

750"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Jenny goes to the florist and buys 15 roses. Now, the florist sells roses in two ways: $2 each or $15 for a dozen. 

First, let's see how much 15 roses cost:
- A dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15.
- Jenny needs 3 more roses, and each of those costs $2.
- So, 3 roses cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, add the cost of the dozen and the extra 3 roses:
- \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so she has \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

The florist gives her change in quarters. She spent 21 dollars, so her change is:
- \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

Since 1 dollar is 4 quarters, 4 dollars is:
- \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"Okay, let's see here. Terry sells some stuff, and we need to figure out how much money he makes.

First, he sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. So, we do 6 times 5.50, which is 33 bucks.

Next, he sells 9 burger platters for $11 each. So, we do 9 times 11, which is 99 bucks.

Then, he sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each. So, we do 20 times 1.50, which is 30 bucks.

Now, we add all that up: 33 bucks for the milkshakes, 99 bucks for the burger platters, and 30 bucks for the sodas. That's 33 plus 99 plus 30, which is 162 bucks.

So, Terry makes 162 bucks in total."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

1. The first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
2. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves. So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. This train stays for 5 minutes (which is a quarter of 20 minutes). So, it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
3. The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves. So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. This train leaves right away, so it's gone at 125 minutes.
4. The fourth train, which is Paul's train, comes 20 minutes after the third one leaves. So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

So, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"Well, let's see. Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks every week for 12 weeks. So, she's got 120 toothpicks already. She needs 200 toothpicks in total. That means she still needs 80 more toothpicks. If she keeps saving 10 toothpicks each week, she'll need 8 more weeks to get all the toothpicks she needs.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of that, which means he paid 3/4 of $2000. So, he paid $1500.
3. Then, Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid. That means he sold it for 1.2 times $1500, which is $1800.
4. Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and his friend paid $1800. So, the discount is $2000 - $1800 = $200.
5. To find the percentage discount, we take the discount ($200) and divide it by the original price ($2000), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

If one spring makes one jellyfish every second, and there are 5 springs, then all 5 springs together make 5 jellyfish every second.

Now, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

1 hour is 60 minutes, and 1 minute is 60 seconds, so:
1 hour = 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 3600 seconds

So, 4 hours would be:
4 hours * 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds

If 5 springs make 5 jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, they would make:
5 jellyfish/second * 14400 seconds = 72000 jellyfish

So, the answer is 72000 jellyfish.

"Okay, let's see. Binkie scored 90, right? Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, twice Binkie's score is 180. Add 15 to that, and Frankie's score is 195. 

195"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

James is walking to the store, which is 4 miles away. He gets halfway there, which is 2 miles, and then he realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So, he walks 2 miles to get halfway, and then 2 miles back home. That's 4 miles already.

Then, he has to walk the whole 4 miles to the store again. So, he walks another 4 miles.

In total, he walks 4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed:

8 miles ÷ 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has about 4 bananas. So, she got:
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If she bought these bananas one by one, each banana costs 80 cents. So, for 40 bananas, she would pay:
40 bananas * 80 cents = 3200 cents, which is $32.00.

But she bought them in bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. So, for 10 bunches, she paid:
10 bunches * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, to find out how much she saved, we subtract what she paid from what she would have paid if she bought them one by one:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Okay, let's think about this. Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split. Harry is supposed to get 60 feet more than Sam. 

If we say Sam gets \( S \) feet, then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. Together, they have 100 feet, so:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

That means:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

If we take 60 away from 100, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, if we divide 40 by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Well, let's see. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches every year. So, if we want to know how much it grows in 13 years, we just multiply 2 inches by 13 years. That gives us 26 inches. So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my coins in a jar.

First, we know Marcel sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 150 Trekking bikes. 

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find out how many that is, we take 15% of 300, which is 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes. So, we subtract the Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's look at the prices:
- MTB bikes cost $500 each.
- BMX bikes cost half of an MTB, so $250 each.
- Trekking bikes cost $450 each.

To find out how much Marcel made, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its price:
- For MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- For BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- For Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total earnings:
$52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

So, Marcel made $131,250 from selling bicycles that month.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a simple person who knows how to count.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour. So, in 6 hours, he makes:
5 bales/hour × 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour. So, in 6 hours, it picks up:
3 bales/hour × 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, if the farmer made 30 bales and the truck picked up 18 bales, the number of bales left in the field is:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, at the end of the day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"Okay, let's break this down in a simple way.

John has 6 regular classes each day, but he also has 2 extra classes. So, he has 8 classes a day. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to school 5 days a week.

First, let's figure out how many minutes he spends in class each week:
- 8 classes a day times 40 minutes each class is 320 minutes a day.
- 320 minutes a day times 5 days a week is 1600 minutes a week.

Now, on Saturday and Sunday, he spends some extra time learning. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days. So:
- 1600 minutes divided by 16 is 100 minutes each day.
- 100 minutes on Saturday plus 100 minutes on Sunday is 200 minutes.

Adding the extra weekend time to his regular school time:
- 1600 minutes (school) + 200 minutes (weekend) = 1800 minutes total.

To find out how many hours he spends learning each week, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 1800 minutes divided by 60 is 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Nathan has a bouncy ball. When he drops it, it bounces up to 2/3 of the height it fell from. He drops it from the third floor of a mall, and each floor is 24 feet high. 

First, let's figure out how high the ball was when Nathan dropped it:
- The third floor is 3 floors up.
- Each floor is 24 feet.
- So, 3 floors times 24 feet per floor is 72 feet.

Now, the ball bounces up to 2/3 of 72 feet on its first bounce:
- 2/3 of 72 is 48 feet.

Then, on the second bounce, it bounces up to 2/3 of 48 feet:
- 2/3 of 48 is 32 feet.

So, on the second bounce, the ball goes up to 32 feet.

32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. The first kid is 6 feet tall. Now, 6 feet is the same as 72 inches because 1 foot is 12 inches. So, the first kid is 72 inches tall.

2. The second kid is 2 inches taller than the first kid. So, we add 2 inches to 72 inches:
   \[
   72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second kid. So, we subtract 5 inches from 74 inches:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third kid. So, we add 3 inches to 69 inches:
   \[
   69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the fourth kid is 72 inches tall.

"Well, let's see. If the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, that means they sold 200 bags, right? And if each bag is sold for $5, then the orchard made 200 times 5, which is $1000. So, the orchard earned $1000.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, we have a big dinosaur, the T-Rex, that ate half of a smaller dinosaur, the triceratops. After the T-Rex was done, there was still some meat left. Then, a bunch of velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. Finally, some lazy Allosaurus came and ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Now, let's work backwards to find out how much meat the triceratops had at the start.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. This means that before the Allosaurus came, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.
2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left before the Allosaurus, so before the velociraptors came, there must have been twice as much meat. So, before the velociraptors, there were:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so before the T-Rex came, there must have been twice as much meat. So, before the T-Rex, there were:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

So, the triceratops must have had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate it.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, we need to know how much area we're painting. The room has four walls:
- The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.

Let's calculate the area of each type of wall:
- For the north and south walls: 10 feet wide * 8 feet high = 80 square feet each.
- Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

- For the east and west walls: 5 feet wide * 8 feet high = 40 square feet each.
- Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all four walls:
- Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how much paint we need. One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. So, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
- Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to know how much it will cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
- Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

So, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Ellen got a case of 12 sodas. She shook up 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. That means there are 11 sodas left, with 3 of them still shaken and 8 unshaken.

Then Ellen's brother came and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. So now, there are 8 sodas left in total. Out of these, 2 are shaken and 6 are unshaken.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend has 8 sodas to choose from, and 2 of those are shaken. If the friend picks a shaken soda, they'll get sprayed.

To figure out the chance of getting sprayed, we just need to see how many shaken sodas are left compared to the total number of sodas left. So, it's 2 out of 8.

If we think about it, 2 out of 8 is the same as 1 out of 4. And 1 out of 4 is 25%.

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda is 25%.

25%"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, we got two trains leaving from the same place, but they're going in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles an hour, and the other one is going half that speed, which is 30 miles an hour.

Now, if we want to know how far apart they are after 3 hours, we just need to figure out how far each train has gone in that time and then add those distances together.

The first train, going 60 miles an hour, will travel:
- 60 miles in the first hour
- 60 miles in the second hour
- 60 miles in the third hour
So, in 3 hours, it will have gone 180 miles.

The second train, going 30 miles an hour, will travel:
- 30 miles in the first hour
- 30 miles in the second hour
- 30 miles in the third hour
So, in 3 hours, it will have gone 90 miles.

Now, to find out how far apart they are, we just add the distances:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we need to know how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, we add those up:
31 + 19 = 50 days

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find 20% of 50, we do:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days off

So, Billy works on the rest of the days:
50 - 10 = 40 days

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. So, each day he helps:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, we need to find out how many people he helps over 40 days:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, Billy helps 240 people.

First, we need to know how long it takes to go down each slide.

For the biggest slide:
- It's 300 feet long.
- People go down at 60 feet per minute.
- So, to find out how long it takes, we divide the length by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide:
- It's 240 feet long.
- People go down at 80 feet per minute.
- So, to find out how long it takes, we divide the length by the speed: 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer the biggest slide takes compared to the second biggest slide:
- We subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

So, every day, Bobby spends half an hour for lunch and half an hour for breaks. That's a whole hour each day.

Now, if we count this over 5 days, it's like adding up 5 hours. 

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we need to take that $15.00 off the $85.00. 

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find out how much she paid for the frying pan, we need to figure out what 20% of $20.00 is and then subtract that from $20.00.

20% of $20.00 is $4.00 (because 20% is the same as 20/100, and 20/100 times 20 is 4).

So, the frying pan cost her $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find out how much she paid for the towels, we need to figure out what 10% of $30.00 is and then subtract that from $30.00.

10% of $30.00 is $3.00 (because 10% is the same as 10/100, and 10/100 times 30 is 3).

So, the towels cost her $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance on her credit card:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

Now, when the light goes on, 6 jellyfish change color. These must be the big ones that change color. So, if 6 big jellyfish change color, and that's one out of every three big jellyfish, then there must be 18 big jellyfish in total (because 6 is one-third of 18).

If 18 big jellyfish are one-fifth of all the jellyfish, then the total number of jellyfish must be 90 (because 18 is one-fifth of 90).

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about fancy math or finance stuff.

So, Lauren wants to save up enough money to live for 20 years after she stops working. She wants to live on 40% of what she makes now, and she makes $100,000 a year. That means she needs to save up enough to live on $40,000 a year for 20 years.

First, let's figure out how much she needs in total:
- $40,000 a year for 20 years is $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

Now, Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck every time she gets paid. So, she saves:
- 20% of $100,000 is $20,000 a year.

To find out how many years she needs to save $800,000, we divide the total amount she needs by how much she saves each year:
- $800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

Now, if the whole school has 600 students and 240 of them are boys, the rest must be girls. So, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

600 - 240 = 360

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

So, for the 4-inch heels:
3 women × 4 inches = 12 inches

For the 2-inch heels:
3 women × 2 inches = 6 inches

Now, we add these together:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Then, we divide by the number of women:
18 inches ÷ 6 women = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

Now, if she hikes 250 miles every day for 30 days, that's 250 miles/day × 30 days = 7,500 miles.

But she wants to hike 9,300 miles. So, she needs to hike 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 more miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the extra miles by the number of days: 1,800 miles ÷ 30 days = 60 miles.

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles each day to reach her goal.

"Okay, let's see here. We got 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, 3 times 9 is 27 dollars for the red ones.

Then, we got 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, 11 times 5 is 55 dollars for the blue ones.

Lastly, we got 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, 25 times 3 is 75 dollars for the green ones.

Now, we add all that up: 27 plus 55 plus 75. That's 157 dollars.

So, the store will have 157 dollars after selling all the balls.

"Okay, let's think about this. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, so he gets 3 kg. Paul wants a third of that, so he gets 4 kg. 

Now, if Pierre takes 3 kg and Paul takes 4 kg, together they take 7 kg. So, Jacques will have the rest. 

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"Well, let's see. It was 2 degrees, then it got real cold, dropping 8 degrees, so that's 2 minus 8, which is -6 degrees. Then it warmed up a bit, by 3 degrees, so -6 plus 3 is -3 degrees. So, in the morning, it was -3 degrees Celsius.

"Okay, let's see here. Raymond started with $21. He then saved $11 more, so that's $21 + $11, which makes $32. He spent $5 on a comic book, so $32 - $5 is $27. Then he spent $19 on a puzzle, so $27 - $19 is $8. 

So, Raymond has $8 left. 

8"
"Okay, let's see. Anna had $16 to spend. She already spent $4, so she had $12 left. She bought 2 books and has $2 left. That means she spent $10 on the books. Since the books cost the same, each book must have cost $5.

"Well, let's see. Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, there's a 20% increase. Now, 20% of 50 is 10, because 10 is one-fifth of 50. So, if we add 10 more students to the 50 from last year, we get 60 students this year.

"Okay, let's think about this. The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. That means it blinks 51 times every minute, because 255 divided by 5 is 51.

Now, if we want to know how long it takes to blink 459 times, we can divide 459 by 51. That gives us 9. So, it takes 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"Okay, let's count the fish in Tate's pond.

First, we have:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfish
- 5 female goldfish

Then, Tate buys more fish:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfish
- 3 more female goldfish

Now, let's add them up:
- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we add the totals for male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Now, we find out how many more female fish there are:
- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're just talking it through.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. That's pretty straightforward.

Megan had to walk the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. So, if Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took 4 hours plus 2 more hours, which is 6 hours.

Dior had to do the laundry, and it took her 4 hours longer than Amalia. So, if Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took 4 hours plus 4 more hours, which is 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time they spent:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 8 hours

4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, John drives to his parents' place, and it takes him 2 hours. He drives at 70 miles per hour. So, to find out how far he drives one way, we do:
\[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

That's the distance for one way. But he has to drive back, so the round trip is:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ 280 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 560 \text{ miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

560"
"Okay, let's think about this. If Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days, that's 70 miles total. The question says she'll walk twice as far as Brian in those 7 days. So, if 70 miles is twice what Brian walks, then Brian must walk half of 70 miles. 

Half of 70 miles is 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, we got 400 toys to make, and 5 workers to do it. Four of them are working, and we need to find out how many toys the fifth one makes.

First, let's see how many toys the first four workers make:
- Two of them make 6 toys every hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys each. Together, they make \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.
- The other two workers make 4 toys every hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys each. Together, they make \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, add up what the first four workers make:
- \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The company still needs 20 more toys to finish the order, which means they made \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys by the end of the shift.

So, the fifth worker must have made the difference:
- \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, they must have made:
- \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys per hour."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. That's a big dog!

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. So, we take 60 pounds and divide it by 4:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah also has another dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, we take 60 pounds and divide it by 2:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the dogs:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds (Kory's dog)} + 15 \text{ pounds (Elijah's first dog)} + 30 \text{ pounds (Elijah's second dog)} = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, all the dogs together weigh 105 pounds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Rob got 7 stickers from Kris.
2. Kris kept 9 stickers for himself, so before giving 7 to Rob, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
3. Kris got these 16 stickers from Luis, who gave him half of what he had.
4. So, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving half to Kris.
5. Luis got these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half of what he had.
6. So, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers at the start.

Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

John buys 3 big bags of M&M's, and each big bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of all the M&M's is:
3 big bags * 10 ounces per big bag = 30 ounces

Now, each ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's in it. So, the total number of M&M's John has is:
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. So, the number of small bags he can make is:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"Okay, let's think about this. Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day. The Earth is a big circle, and if you go all the way around it, that's 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 20,000 kilometers.

Now, if Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, we need to figure out how many days it takes for him to fly 20,000 kilometers. We can do this by dividing 20,000 by 400:

\[ 20,000 \div 400 = 50 \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the Earth.

3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, if the 2nd fastest car is 600 mph, the fastest car is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 eggs in total.
2. Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together.
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

First, let's figure out how many eggs Sarah painted. If Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up a little equation:

- Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs.
- Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
- So, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

- \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
- \( 2S = 18 \)
- \( S = 9 \)

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Next, we know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together with Camden and Sarah, they painted 56 eggs. So, the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted together is:

- \( 56 - 30 = 26 \) eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted:

- \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \) eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them in groups of 8. So, I need to figure out how many groups of 8 crayons he can make. I can do this by dividing 200 by 8:
\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]
So, he can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

Each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, so he needs 25 boxes.

Now, each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the total weight of everything, I add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, I need to convert 400 ounces to pounds:
\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"Okay, let's see here. John cuts down a big tree, 80 feet tall. But he can only use 80% of it, so that's 64 feet of tree he can actually work with. He cuts this into 4-foot logs. So, 64 feet divided by 4 feet per log gives us 16 logs.

From each of these logs, he makes 5 planks. So, 16 logs times 5 planks per log gives us 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, 80 planks times $1.2 per plank gives us $96.

So, John makes $96.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

Valerie makes $5000 a month. Her brother makes twice that, so he makes $10000 a month. Together, they make $5000 + $10000, which is $15000 a month.

Now, their mom makes twice what Valerie and her brother make together. So, their mom makes $15000 times 2, which is $30000 a month.

To find out how much they all make together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mom's earnings: $5000 + $10000 + $30000. That's $45000.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Grandma walks 3 miles every day. She spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles. So, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, on the beach, she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes. That means she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast. So, if she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach, she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

So, she spends 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk. 

Add those times together: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk.

"Well, let's see. Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. So, she's got $4 times 8, which is $32. She wants to have $60 in total. So, she needs $60 minus $32, which is $28 more. If she keeps saving $4 each week, she needs to save for $28 divided by $4, which is 7 more weeks. So, it'll take her 7 more weeks to get to $60.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, which is too cold for him. The other mug is at an unknown temperature. When he mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce from the other mug, the water becomes warm enough for him to drink.

To figure out how warm the second mug needs to be, let's think about it this way:

- If the water from the 33-degree mug is too cold, the water from the second mug must be really warm to make the mixed water warm enough.
- We need the mixed water to be at least 40 degrees.

Let's say the second mug is \( T \) degrees. When he mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the mixed water should be at least 40 degrees.

The mixed water temperature can be thought of as a weighted average:
\[ \text{Mixed temperature} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} \]

We need this to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T \geq 40 \times 5 \]
2. Simplify the left side:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
3. Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixed water to be warm enough for Donny to drink.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we start with 50 cows and 20 chickens. That's 70 animals in total.

Now, every day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 more cows. So, in one day, we get 20 more cows. In three weeks, that's 21 days. So, 20 cows times 21 days is 420 cows.

Next, Broilers Limited brings 10 more chickens each day. So, in one day, we get 10 more chickens. In 21 days, that's 10 chickens times 21 days, which is 210 chickens.

Now, let's add all the animals together:
- We started with 50 cows and got 420 more, so that's 50 + 420 = 470 cows.
- We started with 20 chickens and got 210 more, so that's 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, Russell buys 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels. So, 4 packs would cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

But he gets a 10% discount on the total. So, we need to find out what 10% of $40.00 is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Since each pack has 9 bagels and he bought 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, each bagel costs:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, if we take 23 and subtract 5, we get:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes that is. The problem says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, let's break that down:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can set up a simple ratio:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. So, that's 3 eggs times 30 days, which gives us 90 eggs.

Then, Chester ups it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days. So, that's 5 eggs times 30 days, which gives us 150 eggs.

Now, we add the eggs from both times: 90 eggs plus 150 eggs, which equals 240 eggs.

Since a dozen is 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make. We do this by dividing 240 by 12, which gives us 20 dozens.

So, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we know that the bus has 84 people in total, and the number of men to women is 5 to 9. That means for every 14 people (5 men + 9 women), there are 5 men and 9 women.

Now, to find out how many groups of 14 people are in 84, we divide 84 by 14:
\[ 84 \div 14 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. In each group, there are 9 women. To find the total number of women, we multiply 9 by 6:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

So, there are 54 women on the bus initially.

If 20 women get off the bus, we subtract 20 from 54 to find out how many women are left:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my change at the market.

First, let's see how many single sunflowers Faraday sells each day. He makes $26 from selling them, and each one costs $2. So, if I divide 26 by 2, I get:
\[ 26 \div 2 = 13 \]
So, he sells 13 single sunflowers each day.

Next, let's figure out how many bouquets he sells. Each bouquet costs $8, and he makes $56 from selling them. So, if I divide 56 by 8, I get:
\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]
So, he sells 7 bouquets each day.

Now, each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, if he sells 7 bouquets, the total number of sunflowers in those bouquets is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \]
So, he sells 84 sunflowers in bouquets each day.

Adding the single sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets, the total number of sunflowers he sells each day is:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days. So, if he sells 97 sunflowers each day, in 3 days he sells:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, Faraday sells 291 sunflowers in 3 days.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

Adam has $100 and he wants to buy rocks to sell. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy 20 rocks with his $100. That's easy to figure out because $100 divided by $5 is 20.

Now, he sells each rock for $7. But he only sells 60% of his rocks. So, 60% of 20 rocks is 12 rocks. That means he sells 12 rocks.

If he sells 12 rocks at $7 each, he makes 12 times $7, which is $84.

But he spent $100 to buy all the rocks. So, if he only makes $84 from selling 12 rocks, he loses some money. To find out how much he loses, we subtract what he made from what he spent: $100 minus $84 is $16.

So, Adam loses $16.

Next, for the medium pictures:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium pictures a day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium pictures.
- So, 36 divided by 6 is 6 days for the medium ones.

Finally, for the small pictures:
- Lauren can draw 7 small pictures a day.
- She needs to draw 49 small pictures.
- So, 49 divided by 7 is 7 days for the small ones.

Now, we add all the days together:
- 9 days for the big ones
- 6 days for the medium ones
- 7 days for the small ones

9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to finish all the pictures."

"Okay, let's see. Jen got 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food every day. So, for all the fish, it's 3 dollars a day. May has 31 days, so if we multiply 3 dollars by 31 days, we get 93 dollars. So, Jen spends 93 dollars on fish food in May.

93"
"Okay, let's see. Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 to her mom, so she only had 6 left. Then she went and bought 15 more. So, if you add those 15 to the 6 she had left, she ends up with 21 roses.

21"
"Okay, let's see. Sid went 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he went 140 miles in 3 more hours. So, he went a total of 250 miles in 5 hours. To find out how fast he was going on average, you take the total miles and divide by the total hours. So, 250 miles divided by 5 hours is 50 miles per hour. 

50"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math.

So, Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first one has a 20% chance of winning. That means if you play this lottery 100 times, you might win about 20 times. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first one has a 20% chance, the second one must have a 60% chance. That means if you play this lottery 100 times, you might win about 60 times.

Now, to figure out the chance that both tickets win, we need to think about it like this: If the first ticket wins 20 times out of 100, and the second ticket wins 60 times out of 100, how often do they both win at the same time?

To find this, we multiply the chances together:
20% (or 0.20) times 60% (or 0.60) equals 0.12, which is 12%.

So, the chance that both tickets win is 12%.

12%"
"Okay, let's see here. Jim got 27 seashells. He got 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos must have got 22 seashells. Carlos got twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey must have got 11 seashells.

Now, let's add all the seashells together:
- Jim: 27
- Carlos: 22
- Carrey: 11

That's 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells in total.

They split these seashells equally among the three of them. So, 60 divided by 3 is 20.

Each person got 20 seashells."
"Well, let's see. Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so that's 4 carrots times 5 days, which is 20 carrots. On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 2 days, so that's 5 carrots times 2 days, which is 10 carrots. Add those together, 20 carrots plus 10 carrots, and Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"Okay, let's see here. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first one. 

To figure out how long the second song is, I need to find 60% of 5 minutes. That's like saying 60 out of 100 parts of 5 minutes. So, 60% of 5 minutes is 3 minutes. 

Now, I add those 3 minutes to the original 5 minutes to get the length of the second song:
5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.

So, the first song is 5 minutes, and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, I add these two times together:
5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, Linus buys a mobile device for $20. He then sells it for twice that amount, which means he sells it for $40.

Now, let's see how many devices he bought:
- On Monday, he bought 2 devices.
- On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices.
So, in total, he bought 2 + 4 = 6 devices.

Next, we need to find out how much he spent in total to buy these devices:
- Each device costs $20.
- For 6 devices, he spent 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's figure out how much he made from selling all the devices:
- He sells each device for $40.
- For 6 devices, he made 6 * $40 = $240.

Finally, to find out his profit, we subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he made:
- Profit = $240 - $120 = $120.

So, Linus made a profit of $120."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

So, Carl's cane is 3 feet long."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, Hortex makes 4200 bottles of carrot juice every day. Each bottle gives 20% of what a person needs for energy in a day. That means to get 100% of what one person needs, they would need 5 bottles (because 100 divided by 20 is 5).

Now, if we want to cover 2300 people, we need to figure out how many bottles that would be. So, 2300 people times 5 bottles each:
\[ 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex already makes 4200 bottles a day. So, to find out how many more bottles they need to make, we subtract the number they already make from the total they need:
\[ 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex needs to make 7300 more bottles to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

7300"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3 out of every 4 in purple. So, 3/4 of 8 is 6. That means 6 babies are in purple.
2. The rest, 1/4 of 8, are dressed in blue. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2. That means 2 babies are in blue.
3. All the blue babies wear bows, so 2 babies in blue wear bows.
4. Out of the 6 babies in purple, 1/3 of them also wear bows. So, 1/3 of 6 is 2. That means 2 babies in purple wear bows.
5. Now, we have 2 babies in blue with bows and 2 babies in purple with bows. In total, 4 babies are wearing bows.
6. We want to know the chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are in purple.
7. So, the chance is 2 out of 4, which is 1/2 or 50%.

The final answer is:
50%"
"Okay, let's see. The IRS got 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. To find out how many they got on Wednesday, I need to add up what they got on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then take that away from the total.

So, 1907 plus 2136 is 4043. Now, 5168 minus 4043 is 1125.

They got 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"Okay, let's see here. Abraham had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. So, he's got 40 square meters left.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of the original land, which is 20 square meters, for $30. Now, he's left with 20 square meters.

Finally, he sold the last 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. That's 20 times 3, which is $60.

So, if we add up all the money he got:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Last sale: $60

Total money he made is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"Okay, let's think about this. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. He goes out three times a day. So, he uses:

2 masks each time he goes out,
3 times a day,
which means he uses 2 times 3, that's 6 masks a day.

Now, we need to know how many masks he uses in 2 days. So, we take the 6 masks he uses each day and multiply that by 2 days:

6 masks a day times 2 days equals 12 masks.

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting marbles.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Now, a dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36 eggs. So, Cole hid 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs. That's easy to remember.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar. So, if Lamar found 5, Stacy found 5 times 2, which is 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy. So, if Stacy found 10, Charlie found 10 minus 2, which is 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie. So, if Charlie found 8, Mei found 8 divided by 2, which is 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
- Lamar found 5
- Stacy found 10
- Charlie found 8
- Mei found 4

So, 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs found in total.

If Cole hid 36 eggs and they found 27, then the number of eggs still hidden is 36 - 27, which is 9 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular guy.

First, we got two apartment buildings with 200 apartments each. So, that's:
200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Now, the third building is 60% bigger than the first two combined. So, 60% of 400 is:
400 * 0.60 = 240 apartments.

Add that to the 400 apartments from the first two buildings:
400 + 240 = 640 apartments in the third building.

Now, let's add up all the apartments:
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments in total.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections in a week is:
1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $0.40 for each collection. So, his total earnings in a week are:
3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

So, John makes $1248 in a week.

1248"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting apples in my garden.

1. When the tree is 5 years old, it gives 50 fruits.
2. When it's 6 years old, it gives 3 times as many fruits as when it was 5 years old. So, 3 times 50 is 150 fruits.
3. When it's 7 years old, it gives 7 times as many fruits as when it was 5 years old. So, 7 times 50 is 350 fruits.
4. When it's 8 years old, it gives 200 fruits less than when it's 10 years old. We don't know how many fruits it gives at 10 years yet, so let's come back to this.
5. When it's 9 years old, it doesn't give any fruits at all.
6. When it's 10 years old, it gives 20 times as many fruits as when it was 5 years old. So, 20 times 50 is 1000 fruits.

Now, let's go back to the 8-year-old tree. It gives 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. Since the 10-year-old tree gives 1000 fruits, the 8-year-old tree gives 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

So, the total number of fruits is:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Well, let's see. Jack had 100 dollars. Sophia gave him a fifth of her 100 dollars. A fifth of 100 is 20. So, Jack now has 100 plus 20, which is 120 dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

We have three ropes: a red one, a blue one, and a yellow one. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. And all three ropes together add up to 37 centimeters.

First, let's call the length of the blue rope ""B"" centimeters. 

Since the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, the red rope is 4B centimeters.

The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is B + 7 centimeters.

Now, we know that the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write this as:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Let's add up the B's:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out what B is. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. 

Now, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Ronnie got $5. Rissa got three times as much, so she got $15.

Now, they both gave some money to their little sister. After giving the money, Rissa has 4/5 of her original money left. So, Rissa had $15 to start with, and 4/5 of $15 is:

\[ 15 \times \frac{4}{5} = 12 \]

This means Rissa gave away $3 because:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3.

So, Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3. That means Ronnie has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, Ronnie has $2 left.

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

The mural is half yellow, so that means half of the 12 pints of paint is yellow. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 pints of the paint is yellow.

Now, the other half of the mural, which is also 6 pints, is split equally between red, white, and purple. Since there are three colors, we divide the 6 pints by 3.

So, 6 pints divided by 3 colors is 2 pints for each color.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

2 pints"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we need to find out how big one bedroom is. Each bedroom is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. So, we multiply these numbers:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet for one bedroom.

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4:
240 square feet * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

Next, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet for the living room.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet, as given.

Now, we add up all the areas:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. That's easy enough.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday. So, that's 3 times 2, which is 6 puffs.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday. So, that's 6 times 2, which is 12 puffs.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday. So, that's 12 times 2, which is 24 puffs.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday. So, that's 24 times 2, which is 48 puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs she counted from Monday to Friday:
- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 12 puffs
- Thursday: 24 puffs
- Friday: 48 puffs

Adding them all together:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, Alice counted 93 puffs of clouds in total from Monday to Friday."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, a regular box has 100 dishwasher pods and costs $12. Now, there's a special box that has 20% more pods, but it still costs $12. 

To find out how many more pods that is, I need to figure out what 20% of 100 is. That's 20 pods. So, the special box has 100 pods plus 20 pods, which is 120 pods.

Now, if the special box has 120 pods and costs $12, I want to know how many pods I can get for $1. To do that, I divide the total number of pods by the total cost:

120 pods ÷ 12 dollars = 10 pods per dollar.

Since I use 1 pod per cycle, I can run 10 cycles for $1.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Thomas takes out $1000 from the bank. That's a lot of money! He gets it in $20 bills. So, how many $20 bills is that? Well, $1000 divided by $20 is 50 bills.

2. On his way home, he loses 10 of those $20 bills. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 $20 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 $20 bills. That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 $20 bills.

4. Then, he triples the money he has left. Each $20 bill is worth $20, so 20 $20 bills are worth 20 * $20 = $400. Tripling $400 gives him $400 * 3 = $1200.

5. Finally, he converts all his money into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide $1200 by $5. So, $1200 / $5 = 240 $5 bills.

So, Thomas ends up with 240 $5 bills."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. In the first half, Team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals less than Team A, so Team B scores 2 goals.
2. In the second half, Team B scores 4 times what they scored in the first half. So, Team B scores 4 times 2, which is 8 goals.
3. Team A scores 1/4 of what Team B scores in the second half. So, Team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.
4. Now, let's add up all the goals:
   - Team A: 4 goals in the first half + 2 goals in the second half = 6 goals
   - Team B: 2 goals in the first half + 8 goals in the second half = 10 goals

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses up 45% of it. That means he uses up a bit more than half, but not quite. If you take 5 inches and use up 45%, you use up about 2.25 inches. So, after Monday, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Now, the teacher tries to save chalk and only uses 20% each day after that. So, each day, he uses up a little bit, and the chalk gets a bit smaller.

Let's see how much chalk he has left each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):** He starts with 2.75 inches. He uses 20%, so he uses 2.75 * 0.20 = 0.55 inches. He has 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches left.
- **Day 2 (Wednesday):** He starts with 2.20 inches. He uses 20%, so he uses 2.20 * 0.20 = 0.44 inches. He has 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches left.

By the end of Wednesday, the chalk is down to 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. So, the teacher has to recycle the chalk after 2 more days.

So, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity, which makes 7 kids on varsity. If there are 24 kids in total and 7 are on varsity, then the rest must not be on varsity. 

24 minus 7 is 17. So, 17 kids are not on varsity.

"Okay, let's see here. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them. Then, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drills 4, he caps 4 plus 7, which is 11 teeth. 

Now, to find out how many teeth the dentist fixed in total, we add the drilled teeth and the capped teeth: 4 plus 11, which gives us 15 teeth.

To find out what percentage of his teeth that is, we take the 15 teeth fixed and divide it by the total number of teeth, which is 30. Then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, 15 divided by 30 is 0.5. Multiply 0.5 by 100, and we get 50.

So, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth.

4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000.

Next, Mr. Marcellus found out that 2/5 of the milk was expired. To find out how much milk was expired, we calculate:
2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

Since the expired milk can't be sold, Mr. Marcellus returned it and got a refund. The refund is for the 1600 gallons of expired milk, so:
1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600.

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, if Colin is \( C \) years old now, in seven years he will be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy is five times that age, so Wendy is \( 5(C + 7) \) years old.

Next, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old, and that age is a third of Wendy's current age. Wendy's current age is \( 5(C + 7) \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]

Let's simplify that:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Now, expand both sides:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. He can buy 100 books for $500. First, let's figure out how much one book costs:

- If 100 books cost $500, then one book costs $500 divided by 100, which is $5.

Now, let's see how many books Bob can buy with $27,000:

- If one book costs $5, then with $27,000, Bob can buy $27,000 divided by $5, which is 5,400 books.

Since Bob is splitting these books equally among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:

- 5,400 books divided by 3 schools is 1,800 books per school.

So, Bob can buy 1,800 books for each school.

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one back into the tree. This made 5 more apples fall out.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, plus the one he had left on the ground, so he had 6 apples. He put 5 of them in his pocket and threw the last one at the tree.
4. Throwing that apple made 6 more apples fall out. Newton picked up all 6 of these apples.

Now, let's count how many apples Newton has:
- He put 1 apple in his pocket from the first time.
- He put 5 apples in his pocket from the second time.
- He picked up 6 apples at the end.

So, 1 + 5 + 6 = 12 apples.

First, let's figure out how many slices of cheese pizza they all eat together:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- So, 6 slices per friend times 6 friends equals 36 slices of cheese pizza.

Now, let's figure out how many slices of pepperoni pizza they all eat together:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- So, 4 slices per friend times 6 friends equals 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Next, we need to know how many whole pizzas that is. 

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
- They need 36 slices.
- So, 36 slices divided by 12 slices per pizza equals 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.
- They need 24 slices.
- So, 24 slices divided by 8 slices per pizza equals 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

In total, she needs to buy:
3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas."
"Well, lemme think 'bout this. Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 days, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 miles. Then, on Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 2 days, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 miles. Now, if we add 9 miles and 10 miles together, we get 19 miles. So, Sam ran 19 miles this week.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Jay is making snowballs. He can make 20 in one hour, but every 15 minutes, 2 of them melt. 

First, let's see how many snowballs melt in an hour:
- There are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour.
- So, 2 snowballs melt 4 times in an hour, which is 8 snowballs.

Now, if Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour but 8 melt, he ends up with:
- 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To get 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many hours it will take:
- If he makes 12 snowballs in one hour, then to get 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 12.
- 60 ÷ 12 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, Digimon had its 20th anniversary. That means it came out 20 years ago. John is 28 now. So, 20 years ago, John was 8 years old. 

The problem says that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8, then Jim must have been half of that, which is 4 years old.

Now, if Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, he must be 4 + 20 = 24 years old now.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

24"
"Well, let's see. Doxa ate 1 piece of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so that's 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so that's 3 pieces. If we add all that up, 1 for Doxa, 2 for her sister, and 3 for her brother, that makes 6 pieces in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and got a new pack of 50. So, they ended up with 50 - 38 = 12 more bandages than they started with.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They didn't get any new packs, so they lost 28 bandages.

On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. They also got 2 new packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. So, they ended up with 100 - 25 = 75 more bandages than they started with that day.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total change over the three days: 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, to find out how many they started with, we need to subtract the total change from the final amount:
78 - 59 = 19 bandages.

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"Okay, let's see. May is getting her hair colored and cut. The color costs $40. Her hair is cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so that's 2 inches cut off. The haircut costs $30 for each inch cut. So, for 2 inches, that's 2 times 30, which is $60. Now, we add the cost of the color and the haircut: $40 plus $60, which gives us $100.

So, the total cost is:
100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

1. **Daily Earnings:**
   - Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
   - She gets $1.5 for each hour.
   - So, her daily earnings are 7.5 hours * $1.5/hour = $11.25 a day.

2. **Weekly Earnings:**
   - Jen works 6 days a week.
   - So, her weekly earnings are $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.5 a week.

3. **Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - So, her monthly earnings are $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270.

4. **Attendance Bonus:**
   - Jen gets an extra $10 for not missing any days.
   - So, her total earnings for April are $270 + $10 = $280.

So, Jen will get $280 in April.

280"
"Okay, let's see. Jason did a bunch of chores and got paid for them. Here's how it adds up:

- He did his laundry once, so that's $3.00.
- He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50.
- He took the trash out twice, so that's $0.75 each time, which makes $1.50.
- He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's $0.50 each time, which makes $3.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishes) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two weeks.

9.00"
"Okay, let's think about this. If a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much, that means a shark has 120 gallons of blood. Now, if we have ten sharks, we just need to multiply 120 gallons by 10. So, 120 times 10 is 1200 gallons. 

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood. 

1200"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm counting my chickens.

1. In the morning, 50 people came in. That's 50.
2. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people came in. So now we have 50 + 40, which is 90.
3. After that, twice as many people as came in at 10:00 came in for lunch. That's 2 times 40, which is 80 more people. So now we have 90 + 80, which is 170.
4. By evening, three times as many people as came in the morning came in. That's 3 times 50, which is 150 more people. So now we have 170 + 150, which is 320.

So, the total number of people that came into the restaurant that day is 320."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so:
5 packs × 5 pens = 25 red pens

Next, she bought twice as many black pens as red pens. So, if she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
2 × 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so:
10 packs × 5 pens = 50 black pens

Now, to find out the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

75"
"Okay, let's break this down simple-like.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ 600 \div 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ bottles} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, each bottle of cognac costs:
\[ 60 + (60 \times 0.5) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

2400"
"Okay, let's see here. Mr. Julius, he planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 30 White Oak trees for the second day. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted a quarter more than the first day. A quarter of 40 is 10, so he planted 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add it all up:
- White Oak trees: 20 on the first day + 30 on the second day = 50 White Oak trees.
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 on the first day + 50 on the second day = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees he planted is 50 White Oak trees + 90 Lodgepole Pine trees = 140 trees.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
2. His kids drank 4 gallons, so now there's 24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.
3. Then, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so now there's 20 - 7 = 13 gallons left.
4. Fred's friend Ronnie came over and drank 5 gallons, so now there's 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party. They all share the 8 gallons equally.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the 8 gallons by 3:
8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons per person.

So, each person gets about 2.67 gallons of root beer.

"Well, let's see. If eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40, we can figure this out step by step.

First, we take 40 and subtract 8, because we need to find out what four times the number of coffee mugs is. So, 40 minus 8 is 32.

Now, we need to find out what number, when multiplied by 4, gives us 32. So, we divide 32 by 4, and that gives us 8.

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, we got 66 fish in the tank. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- One-third of 66 is 22. So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to figure out how many fish are left:
- 66 fish total minus 22 fish with red stripes leaves us with 44 fish.

Next, we're told that 5 out of every 11 of these remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- If 11 parts of the fish are 44, then each part is 44 divided by 11, which is 4.
- So, 5 parts would be 5 times 4, which is 20. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the fish with red stripes and the fish with blue stripes to get the total:
- 22 fish with red stripes plus 20 fish with blue stripes equals 42 fish.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, and each palette had 4 colors. So, that's:
2 palettes × 4 colors = 8 colors

Then, she had three makeup sets, and each set had 6 colors. So, that's:
3 sets × 6 colors = 18 colors

Adding those together, Amy had:
8 colors + 18 colors = 26 colors

Now, her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, we take away those 4 colors:
26 colors - 4 colors = 22 colors

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
6 colors ÷ 2 = 3 colors

We take away those 3 colors:
22 colors - 3 colors = 19 colors

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as high as he is. So, the total height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison. So, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's see here. There were 700 shells found by 20 tourists. The Alphas got 40% of those shells. So, 40% of 700 is 280 shells. That leaves 420 shells for the other two groups.

Now, The Finders got 60% of what was left. So, 60% of 420 is 252 shells. That means The Finders got 252 shells.

So, the Gogetters must have found the rest. If we take the 280 shells the Alphas found and the 252 shells The Finders found, that's 532 shells in total. So, the Gogetters found 700 minus 532, which is 168 shells.

"Okay, let's think about this. Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles each. So, all together, they need to walk 12 miles a day. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second walks 4 miles, and the third walks 3 miles. If we add those up, that's 1 + 4 + 3, which is 8 miles.

So, to get to 12 miles, the last dog must walk 4 miles.

"Okay, let's see. John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that. So, 40% of 250,000 is 100,000. That means he gets a loan of $100,000.

Now, he uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. So, 60% of 100,000 is 60,000. That means he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

So, if he had $100,000 and he used $60,000 to pay off his debts, he has $40,000 left.

"Okay, let's see. Deandre caught 3 tunas. The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one 46 kilograms, and the third one 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs 50 cents, we need to figure out how much he'll make.

First, we add up the weights:
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, we need to find out how much 128 kilograms of tuna is worth at 50 cents per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = 64 dollars

So, Deandre will earn 64 dollars after selling all the tunas.

"Okay, let's see. Trinity bought some magazines for $72. She sells them for 11/8 of what she paid. So, we need to figure out what 11/8 of $72 is.

First, let's find out what 1/8 of $72 is. If we divide 72 by 8, we get 9. So, 1/8 of $72 is $9.

Now, 11/8 means 11 times 1/8. So, we multiply $9 by 11, which gives us $99.

Trinity sells the magazines for $99. To find out her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she sold them for. So, $99 minus $72 is $27.

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the dehumidifier on the low setting takes out 1 liter of water each day. Brian runs it for 3 days, so:
1 liter/day × 3 days = 3 liters

Next, on the medium setting, it takes out twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters each day. Brian runs it for 3 days, so:
2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters

Finally, on the high setting, it takes out twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters each day. Brian runs it for 5 days, so:
4 liters/day × 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add up all the water it took out:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

So, the total amount of water the dehumidifier took out is 29 liters."
"Well, let's see. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, that's 10 times 30, which is 300 balloons. At the end, they had 12 balloons left. So, they must have thrown 300 minus 12, which is 288 balloons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali has one class with 120 students. So, his school can hold 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's classes can hold 1/8 of what Ali's class can hold.
   - So, each of John's classes can hold \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   - Since John has two classes, his school can hold \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - To find the total number of students both schools can hold, we add the capacities together.
   - Ali's school: 120 students
   - John's school: 30 students
   - Total: \( 120 + 30 = 150 \) students

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting out coins.

1. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.
2. He promised to pay back 2% more. So, 2% of $300 is $6 (because 2% is like 2 out of 100, so 2 times 300 divided by 100).
3. So, the total amount he needs to pay back is $300 + $6 = $306.
4. For 11 months, he pays $25 each month. So, 11 times $25 is $275.
5. After 11 months, he has paid $275, so he still owes $306 - $275 = $31.

So, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay $31."
"Okay, let's figure this out. Jordan has 2 kids, and each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day. So, that's 10 diaper changes in total. Jordan's wife does half of them, which means she does 5 diaper changes. So, Jordan has to do the other half, which is also 5 diaper changes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. **Volume of the Jar:**
   The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall. So, the volume is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Effective Volume:**
   They said the jelly beans only fill up about 80% of the space. So, the effective volume is:
   \[
   540 \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Number of Jelly Beans:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. So, the number of jelly beans is:
   \[
   \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Red Jelly Beans:**
   Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans he guesses is:
   \[
   2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}

5. **How Far Off:**
   The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. So, the difference is:
   \[
   900 - 864 = 36

3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on. That's 3/4 of 40, which is 30 more people. So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So 90 people double to 180 people.
5. The bus can hold 200 people. If there are 180 people on the bus, then 200 - 180 = 20 more people can get on to fill it up.

So, the number of people needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, for one year, she spends:
3 visits * $2 = $6

She does this for 5 years, so:
5 years * $6 = $30

After 5 years, the price goes up by 150%. To find out what 150% of $2 is, I'll do:
150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new price is:
$2 + $3 = $5

Now, Pauline keeps going to the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years at the new price. So, for one year, she spends:
3 visits * $5 = $15

For 3 years, she spends:
3 years * $15 = $45

Adding the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

So, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

First, we need to know how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades. So, we do:

10 students per grade times 4 grades, which gives us 40 students.

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students we can make from these 40 students. We do:

40 students divided by 8 students per group, which gives us 5 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we need to find out how long it will take for all 5 groups to have their turn. We do:

5 groups times 45 minutes per group, which gives us 225 minutes.

If we call the shorter piece \( x \), then the longer piece is \( 4x \). Together, they add up to 40 feet, so:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

That means:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide 40 by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times longer, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The longer piece is 32 feet.

"Okay, let's think this through. If Aiden makes 16 meatballs from 1 pound of meat and he needs to make 80 meatballs, we need to figure out how many pounds of meat that is. 

So, 80 meatballs divided by 16 meatballs per pound equals 5 pounds of meat. 

Now, for every pound of meat, he uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, for 5 pounds, he would need 5 times 2 tablespoons, which is 10 tablespoons.

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

\[ 5 \text{ windows} \times 35 \text{ inches} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we need to multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

After 16 minutes, the price drops to 20 cents per minute. The call goes on for 36 minutes total, so you have 20 more minutes to pay for at the new price. So, 20 minutes times 20 cents is:
20 * 0.20 = 4 dollars

Now, add the two amounts together:
4 dollars + 4 dollars = 8 dollars

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out for the first time.

So, Carly is making treats for her art class. There are 5 people in the class, and each person gets 2 treats. That means there are 10 treats in total.

Now, Carly makes brownies and cupcakes. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say she makes \( c \) cupcakes. Then, the number of brownies she makes is \( 3c - 2 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c = 12 \]
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. If you get both, you get a 20% discount. So, let's add those up first:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, 20% off of $75 is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discount is $15. Subtract that from the total:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, Karen wants nail art on all 10 of her fingers. Each nail art costs $3, so:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

90"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, that's:
3 magazines × 12 issues = 36 issues

Next, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's:
1 magazine × 6 issues = 6 issues

Then, she has another magazine that sends 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine. So, that's:
4 × 6 issues = 24 issues

Now, let's add all these up:
36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're figuring it out together.

Samantha has 27 paintings. The problem says she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, the problem says Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

1. In November, the toy costs $40.
2. In December, the price goes up by 80%. To find out how much it goes up, I take 80% of $40. That's 0.80 times 40, which is $32. So, the new price in December is $40 plus $32, which is $72.
3. In January, the price goes down by 50%. To find out how much it goes down, I take 50% of $72. That's 0.50 times 72, which is $36. So, the new price in January is $72 minus $36, which is $36.

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

36"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Charlie teaches 4 lessons at $80 each. So, for those lessons, he makes:
4 lessons * $80 = $320

Next, for the veteran lessons, he gives a 25% discount. So, the price for each veteran lesson is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

He teaches 2 veteran lessons, so he makes:
2 lessons * $60 = $120

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

So, Charlie makes $440 for the day.

440"
"Okay, so Sally got these scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. To find her average score, I need to add all these numbers up and then divide by how many quizzes there are.

Let's add them up:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, I count the quizzes:
There are 9 quizzes.

To find the average, I divide the total by the number of quizzes:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's average score is 70.

70"
"Well, let's see. Eve had 20 pomelos at first. After giving some to her friend, she only had 1/4 of what she started with. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5. That means she's left with 5 pomelos. If she had 20 and now has 5, she must have given away 15 pomelos.

15"
"Okay, let's see. Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2 out of every 5 apples, so he ate 24 apples. That leaves him with 36 apples. Then, he gave his sister a quarter of the 36 apples, which is 9 apples. So, he's left with 27 apples. He sold these 27 apples to his uncle for $3 each. So, he got 27 times 3, which is 81 dollars.

81"
"Okay, let's think about this. If 9 novels are 3 quarters of what Regina wrote this year, we need to find out what 1 quarter is, and then we can figure out the whole thing.

So, if 9 is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter would be 9 divided by 3, which is 3. Now, if 1 quarter is 3 novels, then the whole thing (4 quarters) would be 3 times 4, which is 12.

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

12"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Michael is driving at 50 kilometers every hour. He's driving for 3 whole days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, that's 3 times 24, which is 72 hours.

Now, if he drives 50 kilometers each hour for 72 hours, he covers 50 times 72, which is 3600 kilometers.

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 kilometers. To find out what part of this distance Michael has covered, we can think of it like this: 3600 kilometers out of 6000 kilometers.

To find the percentage, we can do a simple calculation: (3600 / 6000) times 100. That's 0.6 times 100, which is 60%.

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

60%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're counting marbles.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes. That's easy to remember.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make juice. So, if Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 times 6, which is 30 grapes.
3. Their mom used the rest of the grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes. So, 4 pies times 12 grapes per pie is 48 grapes.

Now, let's add all the grapes together:
- Grapes Madeline ate: 6
- Grapes her brother used: 30
- Grapes her mom used: 48

So, 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The total number of grapes at the beginning was 84."
"Well, let's see. There were 82 teachers in total. If 13 were sick, that means 82 minus 13, which is 69 teachers. But then, 9 substitute teachers came in. So, we add 9 to 69, which gives us 78 teachers at school that day.

78"
"Well, let's see. Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. The pasta costs him a dollar, the cheddar cheese costs him three dollars, and the gruyere cheese costs him twice as much as the cheddar, so that's six dollars. 

So, every week, he spends:
1 dollar for pasta + 3 dollars for cheddar + 6 dollars for gruyere = 10 dollars.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he spends:
10 dollars a week × 52 weeks = 520 dollars.

So, Bud spends 520 dollars on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

520.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, I need to know how long it takes to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, 80 classrooms times 15 minutes each is 1200 minutes total.

Next, I need to figure out how many minutes the custodian works in a day. They work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 8 hours times 60 minutes is 480 minutes a day.

Now, I need to find out how many minutes the custodian spends cleaning each day. They have 5 days to clean all the classrooms, so 1200 minutes total divided by 5 days is 240 minutes a day.

Finally, I need to find out what percentage of the day they spend cleaning. They spend 240 minutes cleaning out of 480 minutes in a workday. To find the percentage, I divide 240 by 480 and then multiply by 100. That's 240 divided by 480, which is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, we need to know how many books each part of the bookcase can hold:
- The middle shelves, there are 2 of them, and each can hold 10 books. So, 2 times 10 is 20 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20 minus 5, which is 15 books.

Now, let's add up all the books one bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
- Total for one bookcase: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
- 110 divided by 55 is 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Rose bought five dozens of eggs. A dozen is 12 eggs, so five dozens is:
5 * 12 = 60 eggs

She paid $2.40 for each dozen. So for five dozens, she paid:
5 * $2.40 = $12.00

Now, she's selling these eggs. She sells them at $1 for every 3 eggs. So, with 60 eggs, she can make:
60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs

Each set of 3 eggs sells for $1, so she will make:
20 * $1 = $20.00

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract what she paid from what she earns:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

8.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of these hats are red, so that means 50 hats are red.
3. After taking out the red hats, we have 50 hats left.
4. Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, we need to find out what 3/5 of 50 is:
   - 3/5 of 50 is 30 hats.
5. So, 30 hats are blue.
6. Now, we have 50 hats left, and we've already counted 30 as blue, so the rest must be white.
7. The number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's see. Archie buys a bag of beef jerky that has 30 sticks in it. The bag usually costs $18, but it's on sale for $3 less. So, the bag costs $15 now. 

To find out how much each stick costs, I need to split the $15 by the 30 sticks. That's $15 divided by 30, which is $0.50. But we need to know how many cents that is. Since $1 is 100 cents, $0.50 is 50 cents.

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle.

First, Audrey has to take two tests. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. That means there are 110 questions in total.

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of all the questions right. So, we need to find out what 70% of 110 is:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions right:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, she got 42 questions right on the first test.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number she needs to get right:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to pass and move on to the 7th grade.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out.

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them. She makes some with strawberries and some with blueberries. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. And she makes 116 ice cubes in total.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of cubes is:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, let's find out how many blueberry cubes she makes:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, Jason needs to sell 15 cars to get his bonus. He tells me that for every 2 people who come to the dealership, 1 person buys a car. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 times 2 people to come in, which is 30 people.

Next, he says that for every 25 phone calls he makes, 1 person comes to the dealership. So, to get 30 people to come in, he needs to make 30 times 25 phone calls.

Let's do the math:
30 times 25 is 750.

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and get his bonus.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're counting on our fingers.

First, let's count the flashlights:
- Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people, so that's 4 flashlights.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16 flashlights.
- So, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of 8 is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms with 4 small candles each is 4 times 4, which is 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, the other 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each is 4 times 5, which is 20 medium candles.
- So, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the flashlights and candles together:
- Total flashlights: 20
- Total candles: 36
- Total items: 20 + 36 = 56

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is 56."

First, John takes 5 minutes to get the first side of the Rubik's cube done. That's easy to remember.

Next, the second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, that's 5 minutes times 2, which is 10 minutes for each of those sides. So, for two sides, that's 10 minutes plus 10 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Then, the last two sides each take half as long as the first side. So, that's 5 minutes divided by 2, which is 2.5 minutes for each of those sides. For two sides, that's 2.5 minutes plus 2.5 minutes, which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second and third sides: 20 minutes
- Fourth and fifth sides: 5 minutes

So, 5 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 30 minutes.

John takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

First, Tim works 6 hours each day. That's like 6 big chunks of time. He does this for 5 days, so:
6 hours/day × 5 days = 30 hours in a week.

Now, each hour has 60 minutes, so:
30 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes in a week.

Tim spends 15 minutes on each call. So, to find out how many calls he can handle, we divide the total minutes by the time per call:
1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls.

So, Tim deals with 120 calls in his 5-day work week.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If it usually takes 7 minutes for the varnish to dry on one painting, and Louise has 6 paintings, then with the old varnish, it would take:

7 minutes × 6 paintings = 42 minutes

But today, the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So for 6 paintings, it would take:

12 minutes × 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Now, to find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish, we subtract the old time from the new time:

72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer with the new varnish.

8 plants * 1 cup = 8 cups

Now, we need to figure out how many plants are left. We know Crista has 20 plants in total. We already counted 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the rest of the plants are:
20 plants - 12 plants = 8 plants

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. So, that's:
8 plants * 0.25 cups = 2 cups

Now, we add up all the water:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who knows a bit about time and distance.

Phineas Frog needs to get back home, and he's 200 yards away. Half of that distance, which is 100 yards, he has to hop on land, and the other 100 yards he has to swim in water.

On land, Phineas can hop 20 yards in one minute. So, to hop 100 yards, it would take him:
100 yards ÷ 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

In water, Phineas can swim 10 yards in one minute. So, to swim 100 yards, it would take him:
100 yards ÷ 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in water:
5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to get back home.

Now, he sells each doughnut for $2. So, if he sells all 120 doughnuts in a day, he makes:
120 doughnuts x $2 = $240 each day.

June has 30 days, so if he sells all his doughnuts every day in June, he makes:

- For the blouses: 5 blouses * $5 = $25
- For the pants: 2 pants * $8 = $16
- For the skirt: 1 skirt * $6 = $6

Now, add all that up to see what she pays in one week:
- $25 + $16 + $6 = $47

She does this for 5 weeks, so:
- $47 * 5 = $235

So, Alicia spends $235 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, John's normal talking speed is 150 words per minute. After training, he talks 2.5 times faster. So, we need to multiply 150 by 2.5 to find out how fast he talks now.

150 words per minute * 2.5 = 375 words per minute

Next, we need to know how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we need to find out how long it takes John to say 4500 words at his new speed of 375 words per minute. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his new speed:

4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting folks at the beach.

First day, Conor saw 50 people. That's easy enough.

Next day, there were 20 more people than the first day. So, 50 plus 20 is 70 people.

On the third day, there were twice as many people as the second day. So, 70 times 2 is 140 people.

For the rest of the week, which is 4 more days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, 60 times 4 is 240 people.

Now, let's add all these up:
- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people
- Last four days: 240 people

2. Next 30 seconds: Three times as many as the first, so that's 3 times 20, which is 60 kernels.
3. Next 30 seconds: Four times as many as the first, so that's 4 times 20, which is 80 kernels.
4. Last 30 seconds: Half as many as the last 30 seconds, so that's half of 80, which is 40 kernels.
5. After the pan is off the heat: A quarter of the last 30 seconds, so that's a quarter of 40, which is 10 kernels.

First, Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the pool party. The recipe says he needs 1 cup of lemon juice for each gallon. So, for 4 gallons, he needs:
- 4 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

Now, 6 lemons give him 1 cup of juice. So, for 4 cups, he needs:
- 4 cups × 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Next, Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade, but it needs to be twice as tart. This means it needs 2 cups of lemon juice. So, for Allen's gallon, he needs:
- 2 cups × 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

Adding it all up, Tim needs:
- 24 lemons for the pool party + 12 lemons for Allen = 36 lemons.

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

36"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, we got 3 German Shepherds, and each one eats 5 kilograms of dog food every day. So, for the German Shepherds:
3 dogs * 5 kilograms each = 15 kilograms a day.

Next, we got 2 Bulldogs, and each one eats 3 kilograms of dog food every day. So, for the Bulldogs:
2 dogs * 3 kilograms each = 6 kilograms a day.

Now, we add the food for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to find out how much they all eat in one day:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms a day.

Since we want to know how much they eat in a week, and there are 7 days in a week, we do:
21 kilograms a day * 7 days = 147 kilograms in a week.

So, the kennel needs 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

147"
"Okay, let's think about this. We got 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each. 

First, let's count the legs for the 2-legged animals:
10 animals times 2 legs each equals 20 legs.

Next, for the 4-legged animals:
15 animals times 4 legs each equals 60 legs.

Now, let's add all the legs together:
20 legs plus 60 legs equals 80 legs.

Since we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs divided by 2 equals 40 pairs of legs.

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

40"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

So, we have a tower made of blocks. There are 4 blue blocks, and twice as many yellow blocks. That means there are 8 yellow blocks because 4 times 2 is 8.

Now, we know there are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, which adds up to 12 blocks.

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, to find out how many red blocks there are, we need to subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

32 blocks in total minus 12 blocks (blue and yellow) equals 20 red blocks.

So, there are 20 red blocks. 

20"
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just figuring it out myself.

So, Elvis drives for 5 hours going west. He's driving at 18 miles every hour, so that means he goes 5 times 18, which is 90 miles west.

Then, he turns around and drives for 8 hours going east. He's still driving at 18 miles every hour, so that means he goes 8 times 18, which is 144 miles east.

Now, to find out how far he is from his house, we need to see how much more he drove east than west. He drove 144 miles east and 90 miles west, so we subtract 90 from 144 to find the difference.

144 minus 90 is 54.

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house.

54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just figuring it out myself.

First, Gary bought a boat for $9000. That's a lot of money!

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat loses 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat loses another 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, after three years, the boat is worth $3528.

3528"
"Okay, let's see here. We got a big bag of Starbursts, and it's got 232 pieces in it. Now, they say there are 54 red ones. That's a lot! 

Then, they say there are twice as many orange ones as red ones. So, if there are 54 red ones, then there must be:
\[ 54 \times 2 = 108 \]
orange ones. That's even more!

Next, they say there are half as many yellow ones as red ones. So, if there are 54 red ones, then there must be:
\[ 54 \div 2 = 27 \]
yellow ones. 

Now, let's add up all the red, orange, and yellow ones:
\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

So, if there are 232 pieces in total and 189 of them are red, orange, or yellow, then the rest must be pink. So, we do:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, there are 43 pink candies. 

43"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Helen stayed at a hotel for 3 nights. Each night costs $80. So, for 3 nights, it would be:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

Next, she took the bus 7 times. Each bus ride costs 10% of the hotel price. So, 10% of $80 is:
10% * $80 = $8

For 7 bus rides, it would be:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus rides together:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for her trip.

296"
"Okay, let's think about this. Mazie had 52 marbles and she gave them all to Dallas and Darla. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before he dropped them, he had 21 + 4, which is 25 marbles. That means Mazie gave 25 marbles to Dallas. So, if Mazie had 52 marbles and gave 25 to Dallas, she must have given the rest to Darla. 

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"Okay, let's see. Two grown-ups and one kid go to the movies. The grown-ups' tickets cost $12 each, so that's $24 for both. The kid's ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each, so that's $6 for the popcorns.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Grown-ups' tickets: $24
- Kid's ticket: $8
- Popcorns: $6

So, $24 + $8 + $6 = $38

They pay $38 in total."
"Okay, let's see. John's car is broken, and he needs to push it. The car itself is pretty heavy, 1200 pounds. He's got some stuff in it too, like his luggage which is 250 pounds, and his two kids, each weighing 75 pounds. So, we need to add all that up:

1200 pounds for the car,
250 pounds for the luggage,
75 pounds for one kid,
75 pounds for the other kid.

That's 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds total.

Now, to push the car, he needs to use a force that's 1% of the total weight. So, we take 1% of 1600 pounds:

1% of 1600 is 16 pounds.

So, John needs to push with 16 pounds of force.

"Well, let's see. James wants to hang crepe paper all around his backyard fence. The fence is a rectangle, and it's 20 feet long on the long sides and 15 feet long on the short sides. 

To figure out how much crepe paper he needs, we need to add up all the sides. So, we have two long sides and two short sides. 

For the long sides: 20 feet + 20 feet = 40 feet
For the short sides: 15 feet + 15 feet = 30 feet

Now, we add those together: 40 feet + 30 feet = 70 feet

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

70"
"Okay, let's see. Mia is 40 and she's 16 years younger than Emma. So, Emma must be 56, right? To find the average, we add 40 and 56, which gives us 96. Then we split 96 in half, so the average age is 48.

48"
"Well, let's see. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. So, if we add all those up, that's 214 plus 432 plus 86, which gives us 732 seashells in total. But, oh, 67 of them were cracked, so we gotta take those out. So, 732 minus 67 is 665. That means they found 665 good seashells together.

665"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, 12 salad plates, and 12 bowls for her holiday dinner.

- Each dinner plate costs $6.00.
- Each bowl costs $5.00.
- Each salad plate costs $4.00.

First, let's calculate the cost for the dinner plates:
12 dinner plates × $6.00 each = $72.00

Next, the cost for the bowls:
12 bowls × $5.00 each = $60.00

Then, the cost for the salad plates:
12 salad plates × $4.00 each = $48.00

Now, let's add up all these costs:
$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on the place settings.

"Well, let's see. Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle. Half of that time would be 5 hours. Now, Anna took 2 hours more than that. So, if we add 2 hours to 5 hours, that makes 7 hours. 

So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Dexter has five pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and they eat that twice a day. That means each pig eats 8 pounds of feed every day. 

Now, if we have five pigs, and each one eats 8 pounds a day, then all the pigs together eat 40 pounds of feed every day.

A week has 7 days, so if the pigs eat 40 pounds a day, in a week they will eat 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. If the pigs eat 280 pounds in a week, then the amount of feed left after a week is 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just a regular person.

First, John invited 20 people to his birthday party. Each person is gonna eat 2 hot dogs. So, we need to find out how many hot dogs that is in total:
20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs

Now, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, we need to figure out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy:
40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs he already has = 36 hot dogs

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, and each pack costs $2. So, we need to figure out how many packs of 6 hot dogs John needs to buy to get 36 hot dogs:
36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Now, we need to find out how much 6 packs of hot dogs will cost:
6 packs * $2/pack = $12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

12"
"Okay, let's see here. Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so that's 20 times 2, which is $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 times 1, which is another $40. So, she makes $40 from cupcakes and $40 from cookies, which adds up to $80.

Now, she buys 5 trays, and each tray costs $4. So, 5 times 4 is $20.

She had $80 and spent $20 on trays, so she has $80 minus $20, which is $60 left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm just figuring it out.

1. **First Street:**
   - The ice cream truck starts with 5 kids following it.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of those 5 kids brings another kid.
   - So, 5 kids + 5 more kids = 10 kids.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of those 10 kids brings 2 more kids.
   - So, 10 kids + 20 more kids (10 kids each bringing 2) = 30 kids.

4. **Kids Leaving:**
   - The original 5 kids give up and leave.
   - So, 30 kids - 5 kids = 25 kids.

So, the number of kids following the truck now is:

"Well, let me think this through. Mamou had 1,360 meals to start with. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday. So, that's 64 + 30 + 48, which adds up to 142 meals given out. If we take those 142 meals away from the 1,360 she started with, we get 1,360 - 142, which is 1,218 meals left.

1218"
"Well, lemme see now. James found a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also found two nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so that's 10 cents for the nickels. Then, he found 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 70 cents for the dimes. 

Now, let's add it all up:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents."
"Okay, let's see. We got 3 sisters, and each one is 16 years old. So, 16 times 3 is 48. Then we got 2 brothers. One is 12, and the other one is twice as old, so that's 24. Add those up, 12 plus 24 is 36. Now, add the sisters' ages to the brothers' ages, 48 plus 36, and that gives us 84.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, let's look at the meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night. That's 30 minutes a day.
- She does this every day, so in one week, that's 30 minutes times 7 days, which is 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, that's 210 minutes times 4, which is 840 minutes.

Now, let's look at the yoga:
- Charisma does yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, 5 days a week.
- In one week, that's 60 minutes times 5 days, which is 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, that's 300 minutes times 4, which is 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the meditation and yoga together:
- 840 minutes of meditation plus 1200 minutes of yoga equals 2040 minutes.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma spends 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga.

"Well, let's see. If a small t-shirt is 3 square feet and Octavia uses 11 of them, that's 3 times 11, which is 33 square feet. 

For the medium t-shirts, each one is 4 square feet, and she uses 8 of them, so that's 4 times 8, which is 32 square feet.

The large t-shirts are 6 square feet each, and she uses 6 of them, so that's 6 times 6, which is 36 square feet.

Now, if we add all that up: 33 plus 32 plus 36, that gives us 101 square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting stuff.

First, a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Now, a dozen is 12, so:
3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 seeds

Next, a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small one. So, we need to find out what 50% of 36 is:
50% of 36 = 0.5 x 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add those extra seeds to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower to get the total for the large sunflower:
36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Finally, to get the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds together:
36 + 54 = 90 seeds

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
90"

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

1. Albert is 36 inches tall.
2. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is 72 inches tall.
3. Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 70 inches tall now.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before the summer, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall.

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, the company makes 5000 chocolate bars every day. They sell each bar for $2. 

First, let's figure out how many bars they make in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, so:
5000 bars/day × 14 days = 70,000 bars

Now, if they sell each bar for $2, then:
70,000 bars × $2/bar = $140,000

So, the company will get $140,000 for selling all the chocolate bars in two weeks.

140000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, Jake buys two T-shirts. The store has a deal where you buy one and get the second one at half price. Each T-shirt costs $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays $8.
- For the second T-shirt, he pays half of $8, which is $4.

So, for the two T-shirts, Jake pays:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off. The original price of the shoes is $40.

- A 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price.
- 60% of $40 is:
\[ 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars for the T-shirts} + 24 \text{ dollars for the shoes} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jake spends a total of:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Okay, let's see here. Ryan gets 6 bucks every week he does his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so that's:

He then bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream costs 1.25 bucks, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \, \text{bucks} \]

After buying the ice cream, he has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \, \text{bucks} \]

Now, he wants to go to the movies. Each ticket costs 6.50 bucks. So, he can buy:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"Okay, let's see here. Ellen bought some stuff for her mom. She got a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5, which is $105.

Lani also bought some things. She got a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes. Each bathrobe costs $100, so two of them would be $100 + $100, which is $200. Adding the sunglasses, Lani spent $30 + $200, which is $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent together, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals. So, $105 + $230 is $335.

They spent $335 in all."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, we need to know how much it costs to make one jar of Tim's special honey and jam mix. 

- For the passion fruit, it takes 2 pounds, and it costs $6 per pound. So, 2 times 6 is $12.
- For the jackfruit, it takes 1.5 pounds, and it costs $8 per pound. So, 1.5 times 8 is $12.
- For the honey, it takes 2 pounds, and it costs $10 per pound. So, 2 times 10 is $20.

Now, add all these costs together: $12 for the passion fruit, $12 for the jackfruit, and $20 for the honey. That's $12 + $12 + $20, which equals $44 to make one jar.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to make 10 jars. If one jar costs $44, then 10 jars would cost 10 times 44, which is $440.

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, if he sells 10 jars, he makes 10 times 50, which is $500.

To find out how much profit Tim makes, we subtract the total cost from the total money he makes. So, $500 (what he makes) minus $440 (what it costs) equals $60.

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars.

- Dimes: There are 95 of them, and each is worth 10 cents. So, 95 times 10 cents is 950 cents, which is 9.50 dollars.
- Nickels: There are 120 of them, and each is worth 5 cents. So, 120 times 5 cents is 600 cents, which is 6 dollars.
- Pennies: There are 750 of them, and each is worth 1 cent. So, 750 times 1 cent is 750 cents, which is 7.50 dollars.

Now, I add all these up:
8 dollars + 9.50 dollars + 6 dollars + 7.50 dollars = 31 dollars

So, the total amount of money in the jar is 31 dollars."
"Okay, let's see here. Janet got $40 from her parents. She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 on a movie ticket for herself, and another $7.50 on a movie ticket for her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 

So, let's add up what she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, add it all together:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

She spent $27.00 in total. So, if she started with $40.00, we subtract what she spent:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

13.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting on my fingers.

First, Josh is open 5 days a week because he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday. That's 7 days minus 2 days.

Next, he services 3 cars each day he's open. So, in one week, he services 3 cars times 5 days, which is 15 cars.

Now, he gets paid $4 for each car. So, for 15 cars, he makes 15 cars times $4, which is $60 in one week.

Since we want to know how much he makes in 2 weeks, we just double that. So, $60 times 2 is $120.

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

Finally, he bakes 4 more of each kind of cookie:
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

So, Randy has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. That's a total of:

6 soldiers × $7 each = $42

Now, we add both amounts together:
$30 + $42 = $72

So, Matthew would earn $72.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

First, the dog digs 6 holes every day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes each night. So, the number of holes Nate actually fills each day is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ 84 \div 3 = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how many weeks 28 days is:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Okay, let's think about this. Norman High School has 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman. 

To find out how many students Butler High School has, we need to multiply 4000 by 3/4:
\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how many more students Norman High School has compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler from the number of students at Norman:
\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

1000"

To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to take the total number of cookies and subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies.

So, 7995 total cookies minus 2595 rainbow cookies minus 3075 oatmeal cookies. 

7995 - 2595 = 5400

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But Igor made some mistakes:

- He only got half as many test tubes as asked, so he got 8 test tubes.
- He got 2 more Petri dishes than asked, so he got 16 Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

In the end, Igor put 29 items on the lab bench. We need to figure out how many beakers he lost.

Let's count the items Igor actually put on the bench:
- 8 test tubes
- 16 Petri dishes
- Some number of beakers (let's call this number \( B \))

So, the total number of items is:
\[ 8 + 16 + B = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):
\[ 24 + B = 29 \]
\[ B = 29 - 24 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Igor put 5 beakers on the bench. Since he was supposed to have 7 beakers, he must have lost:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"Okay, let's figure this out. James is building 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, you need 4 legs times 2 screws, which is 8 screws. For 4 tables, you need 4 times 8 screws, which is 32 screws. James has 40 screws. If he uses 32 screws, he will have 40 minus 32 screws left. That means he will have 8 screws left over.

"Well, if there's 10 eggs in one basket and the other basket has twice as many, that means the second basket has 20 eggs. So, if you put them all together, you got 10 eggs plus 20 eggs, which makes 30 eggs in total.

"Okay, let's see here. Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so that's $430 plus $320, which is $750. Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so that's $300 plus $400, which is $700.

Now, let's add all that up:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

So, $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

They all raised $2180 in total."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like I'm figuring it out for the first time.

Aaron and Vanessa are in a relay race. Vanessa can run 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron. So, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile.

So, if Aaron takes 8 minutes to run one mile (16 minutes for 2 miles), Vanessa takes 16 minutes to run one mile.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she would take:
4 miles × 16 minutes per mile = 64 minutes.

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Okay, let's see. The guy needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. He's got 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 times that much in line. That's 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy the rest. 

600 feet minus the 6 feet he already has is 594 feet. So, he needs to buy 594 feet of line.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just counting my pennies.

First, each person who comes to the restaurant orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's $10 for the meals. They also get a bottle of wine for $5. So, for each person, the total is $15.

Now, if 6 people come each night, and each one spends $15, then the restaurant makes $15 times 6, which is $90 each night.

The restaurant is only open 2 days a week, so if they make $90 each night, over 2 nights they make $90 times 2, which is $180.

So, the restaurant makes $180 a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like I'm just thinking it through.

First, the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. That means the total cost for all the watermelons is $80.

Next, the vendor made a profit of 25%. To find out how much profit that is, we need to calculate 25% of $80. 

25% of $80 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the profit is $20.

Now, to find out the total amount the vendor made from selling all the watermelons, we add the profit to the original cost:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

The vendor made $100 from selling all 50 watermelons.

To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ 100 \div 50 = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like we're figuring it out for the first time.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she must be 9 years old right now.
2. James is twice as old as Dora, so he must be 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John must be 37 years old now (19 + 18).
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 5 years old now (37 - 32).
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8 years old (5 + 3).

So, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a regular person who doesn't know much about math, but I can figure things out.

So, Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. If they both start peeling oranges at the same time, we need to see how many oranges each can peel in one hour, which is 60 minutes.

For Ana:
- If she takes 3 minutes per orange, then in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

For Jane:
- If she takes 4 minutes per orange, then in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges, and Jane peels 15 oranges.
- So, Ana peels \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) more oranges than Jane.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's see here. Mark needs a new radiator. The radiator costs $400, but he gets it for 80% off at a junk shop. So, he only pays 20% of $400. 

20% of 400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80.

Then, he hires a mechanic to install it. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid $230 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like I'm just a simple person who knows a bit about farms.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have 70 legs in total. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

First, let's think about what we know:
- Chickens have 2 legs.
- Cows have 4 legs.

If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ legs} \]

But we know there are 70 legs in total, which is 30 more legs than if all the animals were chickens. Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, so the extra 30 legs must come from cows.

To find out how many cows there are:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ extra legs}}{2 \text{ extra legs per cow}} = 15 \text{ cows} \]

If there are 15 cows, then the rest of the animals must be chickens:
\[ 20 \text{ total animals} - 15 \text{ cows} = 5 \text{ chickens} \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"Okay, let's see. Henry and his 3 friends, that's 4 people in total. They got 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 pieces. So, 7 pizzas times 8 slices each equals 56 slices. If they split these 56 slices equally among the 4 of them, each person gets 14 slices. So, each of them can have 14 slices.
