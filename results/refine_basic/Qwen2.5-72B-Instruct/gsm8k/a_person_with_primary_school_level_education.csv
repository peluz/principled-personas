"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. That's a lot of eggs!

Next, Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are left to sell. If she starts with 16 eggs and uses 7, then 16 - 7 = 9 eggs are left.

Janet sells each of these 9 eggs for $2. So, to find out how much money she makes, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so you need 1 bolt of white fiber. 

So, you add the blue and white fibers together:
2 bolts of blue + 1 bolt of white = 3 bolts in total.

The total number of bolts needed is 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Josh buys a house for $80,000. Then, he spends $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he spent is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, the repairs made the house worth 150% more than it was before. To find out how much more the house is worth, we need to calculate 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the house is now worth:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the total amount he spent from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out. Each sprint is 60 meters long. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
3 sprints × 60 meters = 180 meters

Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs 540 meters in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed every day. So, for all the chickens together, Wendi needs:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups of feed per day} \]

In the morning, Wendi gives the chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given by the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The store has a special deal: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs only 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every two glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

Now, let's figure out how much Kylar will pay for 16 glasses. Since 16 is an even number, we can divide it by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses Kylar is buying:
- 16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs of glasses.

For each pair, Kylar pays:
- $5 + $3 = $8.

Now, we need to find out how much he pays for 8 pairs:
- 8 pairs × $8 per pair = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse has:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how many sheep there are in total. We add the sheep from all three places:
   \[
   20 \text{ (Seattle)} + 80 \text{ (Charleston)} + 160 \text{ (Toulouse)} = 260 \text{ sheep}
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First Part of the Download:**
   - Carla is downloading a big file that is 200 GB.
   - She can download 2 GB every minute.
   - 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB (because 40% means 40 out of 100, so 40/100 * 200 = 80).
   - To download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, it takes 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows makes Carla's computer restart.
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Second Part of the Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download all over again.
   - To download the full 200 GB file at 2 GB per minute, it takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

4. **Total Time:**
   - First part: 40 minutes
   - Restart: 20 minutes
   - Second part: 100 minutes
   - Total time: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes

So, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 3 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{miles per hour} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he realizes he forgot something important.

Next, he tries to get back home in 4 hours. But, oh no! He spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move at all during that time.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes in that time:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles per hour} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 15 miles in the first half-hour after the traffic.

Then, he drives for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes in that time:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 80 \, \text{miles per hour} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, he covers 120 miles in the last 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled back home:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we need to find out how far he is from home. We subtract the distance he traveled back home from the distance he initially traveled away:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza made this week.

First, we need to know how much she makes for the first 40 hours. She gets $10 for each of those hours. So, for 40 hours, she makes:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much she makes for the extra hours. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours more than 40. For these extra hours, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate. Her regular rate is $10, so her overtime rate is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

For the 5 extra hours, she makes:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she made for the first 40 hours and the extra 5 hours:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 460 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Eliza made **$460** this week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. That's easy to remember, right?

2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. So, we need to multiply 60 by 3:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
   So, in the second month, there were 180 downloads.

3. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%. To find out how many downloads that is, we need to calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 180 = \frac{30}{100} \times 180 = 54
   \]
   So, 54 downloads were reduced. Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find out how many downloads were left:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]
   So, in the third month, there were 126 downloads.

4. Now, we add up all the downloads from the three months:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

First, we need to find out how much Toula spent on each type of pastry.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, for 3 dozen, she paid: 3 * $68 = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, for 2 dozen, she paid: 2 * $80 = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, for 6 dozen, she paid: 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Toula spent:
- Total cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes)
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem in school!

Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. But, it also costs $3 each year to water and feed the tree.

First, let's figure out how much money Carlos makes from selling lemons each year:
- 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Next, let's see how much it costs to take care of the tree each year:
- $3

Now, let's find out how much money Carlos actually makes each year after paying for the tree's care:
- $10.5 (money from lemons) - $3 (cost to care for the tree) = $7.5

Carlos needs to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. So, we need to find out how many years it will take to make $90 with $7.5 each year:
- $90 ÷ $7.5 = 12

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from his lemon tree.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **First, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the end.**

2. **Before she got to the orange house, she had more vacuum cleaners.** She sold half of what she had left at the orange house, so before the orange house, she must have had twice as many as she has now. So, before the orange house, she had:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. **Before she got to the red house, she had even more vacuum cleaners.** She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, so before the red house, she had:
   \[
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

4. **Before she got to the green house, she had even more vacuum cleaners.** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so the 12 vacuum cleaners she had before the red house were two-thirds of what she started with. If 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is:
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]
   So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ vacuum cleaners}

1. First, we have 20 students in the dance class.
2. 20% of these students are in contemporary dance. To find out how many that is, we do:
   - 20% of 20 = 0.20 × 20 = 4 students
3. Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.
4. 25% of these remaining students are in jazz dance. To find out how many that is, we do:
   - 25% of 16 = 0.25 × 16 = 4 students
5. Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.
6. These 12 students are in hip-hop dance.

To find out what percentage of the whole class is in hip-hop dance, we do:
- 12 out of 20 students = 12 ÷ 20 × 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Imagine you have two choices:
1. You can buy some pretty jewelry for $5,000. The person who knows a lot about money says that the value of the jewelry will go up by 2.5% in one month.
2. You can buy some cool gadgets for $8,000. The same person says that the value of the gadgets will go up by 1.2% in one month.

We need to figure out which one will make more money.

First, let's see how much more the jewelry will be worth:
- The jewelry costs $5,000.
- It will go up by 2.5%.
- To find 2.5% of $5,000, we do: \( 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \).

So, the jewelry will make $125 more.

Next, let's see how much more the gadgets will be worth:
- The gadgets cost $8,000.
- They will go up by 1.2%.
- To find 1.2% of $8,000, we do: \( 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \).

So, the gadgets will make $96 more.

Now, we compare the two:
- Jewelry makes $125 more.
- Gadgets make $96 more.

The jewelry makes more money, so the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit from the jewelry is:

To find out how far each train went in total, we just add the two distances together:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train traveled 230 miles in total over the two days.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jill makes in a year.

First, we need to find out how much she makes each week from both her jobs.

1. For teaching:
   - She teaches for 35 hours a week.
   - She gets $20 for each hour.
   - So, for teaching, she makes 35 hours * $20/hour = $700 each week.

2. For cheerleading coaching:
   - She coaches for 15 hours a week.
   - She gets $30 for each hour.
   - So, for coaching, she makes 15 hours * $30/hour = $450 each week.

Now, let's add what she makes from both jobs each week:
- Total each week = $700 (teaching) + $450 (coaching) = $1150.

Jill works for 50 weeks in a year, so we need to find out how much she makes in a year:
- Annual salary = $1150 * 50 weeks = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs.
3. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks. So, 21 eggs x 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Now, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs that is. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 eggs by 12.

84 ÷ 12 = 7

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then she walked 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has walked 6 miles in 2 hours.

Now, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles. To find out how long she should take to finish the whole trail, we can use this simple idea:

If she wants to go 12 miles at 4 miles per hour, she should take:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, she needs to finish the whole 12 miles in 3 hours. She has already used 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at 6 miles per hour.

First, we have 10 liters of orange drink. This drink is mostly water—two-thirds of it is water. So, we need to find out how much water is in those 10 liters. We do this by multiplying 10 by 2/3:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But, oh no! We spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, we only have 9 liters of orange drink left. Now, we need to find out how much water is in these 9 liters. We do this by multiplying 9 by 2/3:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of it is water. So, we need to find out how much water is in those 15 liters. We do this by multiplying 15 by 3/5:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, we mix the 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total amount of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

To find out how much water is in the 24 liters of the mixture, we add the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

   So, Raymond is 37 years old now.
3. Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Kyle bought a book for $19.50, but that was after getting a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% would be. If 75% is $19.50, we can find 1% by dividing $19.50 by 75. Then, we can find 100% by multiplying that by 100.

Let's do the math step by step:

1. Find 1% of the original price:
   \[
   \frac{19.50}{75} = 0.26

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

First, we need to find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these up:
- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: $15
- Apples: $6

Total so far: \(12 + 15 + 6 = 33\) dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount she spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\) dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

1. **Shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair costs $16.50.
   - So, the total cost for the shorts is \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair costs $22.50.
   - So, the total cost for the pants is \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair costs $42.00.
   - So, the total cost for the shoes is \( 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
   - Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
   - Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00 \) dollars.

So, Mishka spent 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

1. **How many servings does Cynthia eat in 60 days?**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - So, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

2. **How many cartons of ice cream does she need?**
   - Each carton has 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:

Henry went on a big bike trip that was 60 miles long. He stopped two times. The first time, he stopped after he rode 20 miles. The second time, he stopped 15 miles before he finished his trip. 

To find out how far he rode between these two stops, we need to figure out where his second stop was. Since the trip was 60 miles long and he stopped 15 miles before the end, he must have stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, we know he stopped at 20 miles and then again at 45 miles. To find out how far he rode between these stops, we subtract the first stop from the second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry rode 25 miles between his first and second stops.

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, if the high heels cost $99, the boots must cost:

\[ 99 + 5 = 104 \]

So, the boots cost **104 dollars**."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in a special ratio, 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 parts.
2. Together, their ages add up to 162. So, if we add 7 parts and 11 parts, we get 18 parts in total.
3. Now, if 18 parts equal 162, we can find out what one part is by dividing 162 by 18:
   \[
   162 \div 18 = 9
   \]
4. So, one part is 9. Now, we can find out Darrell's and Allen's ages:
   - Darrell's age is 7 parts, so:
     \[
     7 \times 9 = 63
     \]
   - Allen's age is 11 parts, so:
     \[
     11 \times 9 = 99
     \]
5. To find out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we just add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

So, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years!

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than half of what the first friend said. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend thinks there are 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says there are 25% more than what the first friend said. 25% of 80 is 20 (because 25% is the same as 1/4, and 1/4 of 80 is 20). So, 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100. The third friend thinks there are 100 jelly beans.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses:
- First guess: 80
- Second guess: 60
- Third guess: 100

Adding them up: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Now, we divide by 3 (since there are 3 guesses):
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that John has 10 dogs. Each dog needs 0.5 hours (which is the same as 30 minutes) of walking and taking care of every day.

So, if one dog needs 0.5 hours, then 10 dogs will need:
\[ 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \text{ hours} \]
This means John spends 5 hours each day taking care of the dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use some simple math to figure out how many gold coins she has.

1. First, let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

Now, we know the total number of coins is 110, so we can write this as:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine the \( S \) terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

2. Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the \( 2S \) term:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. That's a lot of shiny things!

Next, we need to figure out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem says Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of what Raymond has. So, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first:

Half of 40 is 20.

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this, so we add 5 to 20:

20 + 5 = 25

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem says Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's 25 jewels:

25 - 2 = 23

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. That's easy to remember!

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many more points that is, we need to figure out what 25% of 4 points is.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 1 more point than he did in the first 20 minutes. That means he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \] points in the second 20 minutes.

Now, to find the total points, we add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to figure out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Terry eats 2 yogurts every day. So, in 30 days, he eats:
   \[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much it costs to buy these yogurts. The store sells 4 yogurts for $5.00. So, the cost of one yogurt is:
   \[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per yogurt} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much 60 yogurts cost. We multiply the number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt:
   \[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

John has 13 lego sets. He sells each one for $15. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, John buys 8 video games. Each video game costs $20. So, the total cost for the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the total money he spent is:
$195 (total money from selling lego sets) - $5 (money left) = $190

Since he spent $160 on video games and has $5 left, the total matches up:
$160 + $5 = $165

But we already know he had $195 from selling the lego sets, so the math checks out.

Now, the question asks how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he doesn't have any left.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

John runs 60 miles every week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as long as the first day, which means he runs for 1.5 hours each of those days.

First, let's add up all the time he spends running:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

So, the total time he runs each week is:
3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the total distance by the total time:
60 miles ÷ 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how fast Dana can run.**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice as fast: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Next, we need to find out how fast Dana can walk.**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - So, if running is 6 miles per hour, walking must be one-fourth as fast: \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Now, let's figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking.**
   - She has 6 hours in total.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \(6 \div 3 = 2\) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \(6 \times 2 \div 3 = 4\) hours.

4. **Let's calculate how far Dana runs.**
   - Running speed is 6 miles per hour.
   - She runs for 2 hours.
   - So, the distance she runs is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

5. **Now, let's calculate how far Dana walks.**
   - Walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.
   - She walks for 4 hours.
   - So, the distance she walks is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

6. **Finally, let's add the distances together to find the total distance.**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
   - Total distance = \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

So, Dana can travel **18 miles** in six hours.

The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet. We need to find out how much farther Polly can throw the javelin compared to the dragon's fire reach.

So, we subtract the dragon's fire reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet away from the dragon's fire and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

First, we need to know how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, we do:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many calories you can still eat today. You've already eaten 1800 calories, and your goal is 2000 calories. So, we do:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips 200 calories is. The whole bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories. So, we need to find out how many grams are in 200 calories. We can do this by setting up a simple ratio:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve:

\[ 300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories} = 1250 \text{ calories} \times x \text{ grams} \]

\[ 60000 = 1250x \]

   - So, on Monday, she spent \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
   - \(\frac{2}{5}\) of 5 is \(2\).
   - So, on Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
   - Each article takes 4 hours.
   - So, on Tuesday, she spent \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday.

3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, one for each cup of coffee.
4. After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

So, we need to figure out how many Post-it notes she had before she used any. We can do this by adding the 220 she used to the 23 she had left:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

This means she had 243 Post-it notes before she used any. Now, we know she started with 80 Post-it notes and bought a package with \( x \) Post-it notes. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had is:

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total money spent by the cost of one tie:
\[ 200 \div 40 = 5 \]
So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Next, we know John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he bought 5 blue ties, he must have bought:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, John bought 10 red ties.

Now, the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. If a blue tie costs $40, then a red tie costs:
\[ 40 + (40 \times 0.5) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]
So, each red tie costs $60.

To find out how much John spent on the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of one red tie:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]
So, John spent $600 on red ties.

Finally, to find out the total amount John spent on all the ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to see how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches. We do this by dividing:

If Uriah takes out 30 comic books, we need to figure out how much weight that is. Since each comic book is 1/4 of a pound, 30 comic books would be:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, by taking out 30 comic books, Uriah has already taken out 7.5 pounds. But he needs to take out a total of 15 pounds. So, he still needs to take out:

Then, we have 67 more raspberries scattered around. So, we add 120 and 67 together.

120 + 67 = 187

So, there are 187 raspberries in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We have a basket with 25 oranges.
2. Out of these, 1 orange is bad.
3. 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find out how many that is, we can do a simple calculation: 20% of 25 is 5 oranges.
4. There are also 2 sour oranges.

Now, let's add up all the oranges that are not good:
- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

So, 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges are not good.

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of not-good oranges from the total number of oranges:
25 - 8 = 17

So, there are 17 good oranges.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then, she pays $800 for the jeweler to make it. So, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of 1300, we can multiply 1300 by 0.10:
\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of $1430.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Marcy gets a special reward for working at her job for a long time. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000 every year after she stops working. But if she works for 20 years or more, she gets a little bit of that $50,000 for each year after 20 years. For each year after 20, she gets 5% more of the $50,000.

So, if Marcy works for 30 years, she works 10 years after the 20-year mark. For each of those 10 years, she gets 5% more of the $50,000.

Let's figure out how much 5% of $50,000 is:
5% of $50,000 = 5/100 * $50,000 = $2,500

Now, for each of those 10 years, she gets $2,500 more. So, we need to add up 10 times $2,500:
10 * $2,500 = $25,000

So, if Marcy works for 30 years, her annual pension will be $25,000.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how much Aleena pays for the first six months. She pays $140 each month. So, for six months, we do:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]
So, she pays $840 for the first six months.

Next, for the second half of the year, the price goes down by 10%. To find out how much 10% of $140 is, we do:
\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \]
So, 10% of $140 is $14. Now, we subtract this from $140 to find the new monthly price:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]
So, for the second six months, she pays $126 each month. For six months, this is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]
So, she pays $756 for the second six months.

Now, to find the total amount she pays for the whole year, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

Sophia's car used 4 gallons of gas to go 100 miles. So, to find out how many miles her car can go on 1 gallon, we divide 100 miles by 4 gallons. That's like sharing 100 cookies among 4 friends equally. Each friend gets 25 cookies, right? So, her car can go 25 miles on 1 gallon of gas.

Now, her car's tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. To find out how far she can go on a full tank, we multiply the miles she can go on 1 gallon by the number of gallons her tank can hold. That's like having 12 friends, and each can carry 25 miles. So, 12 friends carrying 25 miles each can carry 300 miles in total!

1. **First, let's figure out how much time Jim spends in one session:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - Then, he reads for half as long as he watched TV. Half of 2 hours is 1 hour.
   - So, in one session, Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading. That's 3 hours in total.

2. **Next, let's see how much time he spends in one week:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends 3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

3. **Finally, let's find out how much time he spends in 4 weeks:**
   - If he spends 9 hours each week, then in 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

- A coach for the girls' team
- A coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, we have:
5 (girls' players) + 5 (boys' players) + 1 (girls' coach) + 1 (boys' coach) = 12 people

Now, there are 4 schools, so we need to multiply the number of people each school sends by 4:
12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we do:

3. Now, let's add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of students. That's 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
4. The problem also tells us that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, to find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5. That's 180 students / 5 = 36 teachers.

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

This means Bailey got $40 from her allowance over 8 weeks.

Now, we know that at the end of these 8 weeks, Bailey has $100 in total. This $100 includes the money she started with and the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to take away the $40 from the $100:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how many dance classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes every weekday, and there are 5 weekdays. So, for the weekdays, she teaches:
5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, the total number of classes in a week is:
25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes

Next, we need to find out how many students she has in total. Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is:
33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students

Now, Judy charges $15.00 for each student. To find out how much money she makes, we multiply the total number of students by the charge per student:

   \[
   5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much extra money (interest) she has to pay. The interest is 2% of the total cost of the phones.
   \[
   2\% \text{ of } \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels. The top level (the 4th level) has 16 square feet. Each level below it is twice as big as the one above it. So, let's figure out how big each level is:

- The 4th level is 16 square feet.
- The 3rd level is 16 times 2, which is 32 square feet.
- The 2nd level is 32 times 2, which is 64 square feet.
- The 1st level is 64 times 2, which is 128 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the square feet:
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

To find the average, we divide the total square feet by the number of levels:
240 ÷ 4 = 60 square feet.

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much dog food the puppy needs for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days are:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]
The vet said to give 2 cups of food each day for these remaining days. So, for 185 days, the puppy will need:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food needed for the whole year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Each bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:

Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers. He has two choices:
1. He can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each.
2. He can buy flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's figure out how many packages he needs for each choice:
- If he buys packages of 3, he needs \( 18 \div 3 = 6 \) packages.
- If he buys packages of 2, he needs \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \) packages.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each choice:
- For packages of 3, the cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.
- For packages of 2, the cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cheaper cost from the more expensive cost:

30% of $100 is the same as 30 out of 100, which is 30 divided by 100, and then we multiply by 100:
\[ 30 \div 100 = 0.30 \]
\[ 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

The team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. We need to figure out how many games they won.

Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Then the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

Since the total number of games is 22, we can write:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine like terms:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

2. Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Lee's Time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Gerald's Original Time:**
   - Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - So, if Lee runs in 38 seconds, Gerald must have run in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

3. **Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Gerald got 10% faster by changing his diet.
   - If he was 10% faster, he can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - To find 90% of 40 seconds, we do: 40 × 0.90 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

1. **First, we need to find out how many cats there are.**
   - We know there are 60 dogs.
   - For every dog, there are 2 cats.
   - So, if there are 60 dogs, then there are \(60 \times 2 = 120\) cats.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many dogs and cats there are together.**
   - We have 60 dogs and 120 cats.
   - So, the total number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Now, we need to find out how many rabbits there are.**
   - The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats.
   - So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Finally, we need to find out the total number of pets in the neighborhood.**
   - We have 60 dogs, 120 cats, and 168 rabbits.
   - So, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we know there are 200 students in Grade 5. Out of these, 2/5 are boys. So, we need to find out how many boys there are:

2/5 of 200 = (2 × 200) ÷ 5 = 400 ÷ 5 = 80 boys

Now, to find out how many girls there are, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

200 - 80 = 120 girls

Next, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. So, we need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts:

2/3 of 120 = (2 × 120) ÷ 3 = 240 ÷ 3 = 80 girls

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

120 - 80 = 40 girls

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is 40."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how much James slept, we need to multiply 9 by 2/3.

So, we do:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

1. **First, we need to know how much tomato sauce Freda made.** She made 32 ounces of sauce.
2. **When Freda cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume.** This means the tomatoes she started with were twice as much as the sauce she ended up with. So, the tomatoes she started with were:
   \[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]
3. **Each can of tomatoes has 16 ounces.** To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can:
   \[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]
4. **Each can has 3 tomatoes.** So, to find out how many tomatoes she used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since we started with 30 cars, the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that took the exit should equal 30.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Next, Mary got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these to the plants she already has:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Now, Mary is going to give 1 potted plant from each of her 40 window ledges to her friends and family. So, we need to find out how many plants she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's easy to remember!
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we need to find out what 1/4 of 20 is. 
   - 1/4 of 20 is 5.
   - So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. That's a lot!
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
   - So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

- 20 pages from his Social Studies book
- 7 pages from his History book
- 8 pages from his Geography book

If we add all these pages together:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

On Monday, Solo already read 15 pages. So, we need to subtract the pages he has already read from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

First, we divide 42 by 3:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 parts of 3 miles each in 42 miles.

Next, we know that each 3-mile part takes 10 minutes to cover. So, we multiply the number of parts by the time it takes to cover each part:
\[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

So, Poppy puts 250 pieces in place. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Next, Poppy's mom puts a third of the remaining pieces in place. A third means 1 out of 3, so:

750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy's mom puts 250 pieces in place. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

First, we need to figure out the inside size of one box. The box is 5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches tall. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to take that into account.

- For the length, we take away 1 inch from each side, so 5 inches minus 2 inches (1 inch from each side) equals 3 inches.
- For the width, we take away 1 inch from each side, so 6 inches minus 2 inches equals 4 inches.
- For the height, we take away 1 inch from each side, so 4 inches minus 2 inches equals 2 inches.

Now, we know the inside of the box is 3 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall.

Next, we need to find out how much space is inside one box. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and height together:
- 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find out the total space inside all 3 boxes. We do this by multiplying the space inside one box by 3:
- 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Each show on Wednesday was 30 minutes long. To find out how many 30-minute shows he watched, we divide the total time on Wednesday by 30 minutes:

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, if we divide 64 seconds by 16 seconds, we get:
\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \]
This means she rowed 4 times the distance she rows in 16 seconds. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, in 64 seconds she rows:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, if she rows 80 feet, we can find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet:
\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \]
This means the boat took on 2 liters of water 8 times. So, the total amount of water is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

First, we need to find out how much money Sasha spent on the lumber. She bought:
- 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $10.
- 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $16.

So, the total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
10 boards × $10 = $100

And the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
5 boards × $16 = $80

Adding these together, the total cost is:
$100 + $80 = $180

Next, we need to find out how much money Sasha will make if she sells the lumber. The prices have gone up by 50%, so:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$10 + ($10 × 0.5) = $10 + $5 = $15

- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$16 + ($16 × 0.5) = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards × $15 = $150

- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards × $24 = $120

Adding these together, the total revenue is:
$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, to find out how much profit Sasha makes, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

First, let's see how many groups of 20 parts are in 120:
120 ÷ 20 = 6

This means there are 6 groups of 20 parts in 120.

Since 7 parts out of every 20 are sugar, we can find out how much sugar she used by multiplying the number of groups by 7:
6 × 7 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago. That's a lot of money!

Now, Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's. To find out how much Lylah was making, we need to figure out what number, when increased by 30%, equals $40,000.

Let's call Lylah's salary ""L."" If Lylah's salary plus 30% of her salary equals $40,000, we can write it like this:
\[ L + 0.30L = 40000 \]
\[ 1.30L = 40000 \]

To find L, we divide both sides by 1.30:
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah was making about $30,769.23 four years ago.

Next, Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we add 40% of $40,000 to $40,000:
\[ 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

So, Adrien is now making $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. To find her new salary, we add 40% of $30,769.23 to $30,769.23:
\[ 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92 \]

So, Lylah is now making about $43,076.92.

Finally, to find the total salary they are making together now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

Next, we need to figure out how many sheets he uses in a month. We usually think of a month as having about 4 weeks. So, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in one week by the number of weeks in a month:

60 sheets per week × 4 weeks per month = 240 sheets per month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there must have been:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Julia bought some spoons. We don't know how many yet, so let's call that number \( x \).
2. Her husband bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

Now, let's put this all together:

- Julia had \( x \) spoons from her package.
- Her husband added 5 more spoons, so now she had \( x + 5 \) spoons.
- She used 3 spoons to taste the stew, so she had \( x + 5 - 3 \) spoons left.
- We know that after all this, she had 12 spoons.

So, we can write this as:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia bought 10 spoons in her package.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, if he bought 38 chicken sausages, he must have bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. Now, to find out how many sausages he bought in total, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. If Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we need to add 20 to 50 to find out how many friends Amy made. So, Amy made 70 friends. Now, to find out how many friends they have together, we add Lily's 50 friends to Amy's 70 friends. 

50 + 70 = 120

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to know how much each thing costs:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper. So, a watermelon costs:
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, an orange costs:
     \[
     45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Now, let's find out how much Dillon will spend on each type of fruit:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons. So, the cost for the watermelons is:
     \[
     4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers. So, the cost for the peppers is:
     \[
     20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges. So, the cost for the oranges is:
     \[
     10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Finally, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:**
   \[
   180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Dillon will spend a total of:
\[
\boxed{880}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **How many people does the hospital see each day?**
   - The hospital sees 500 people each day.

2. **How long does each person spend at the hospital?**
   - Each person spends 24 minutes at the hospital.

3. **How many minutes do all the people spend at the hospital in one day?**
   - If 500 people each spend 24 minutes, then:
     \[
     500 \text{ people} \times 24 \text{ minutes/person} = 12,000 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **How many hours is that?**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     12,000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **How much does the hospital charge patients per hour?**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.

6. **How much money does the hospital make from patients in one day?**
   - If the hospital charges $200 per hour and sees patients for 200 hours, then:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **How much do the doctors charge the hospital per hour?**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.

8. **How much money does the hospital pay to the doctors in one day?**
   - If the doctors charge $150 per hour and work for 200 hours, then:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

9. **How much profit does the hospital make?**
   - The profit is the money the hospital makes from patients minus the money it pays to the doctors:
     \[
     40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}

First, Nissa hires 60 elves. That's a lot of elves!

Then, a third of the elves quit because some kids got sick on them. A third of 60 is 20, so 20 elves quit.

Now, we need to find out how many elves are left. We started with 60 and 20 quit, so:

60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

Next, 10 more elves quit because some kids kicked their shins. So, we need to subtract 10 from the 40 elves that were left:

40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

So, the number of elves left is 30."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than what he spent in May. So, in June, he spent $500 - $60, which is $440. Now, to find out how much he spent in total for both months, we add the amounts from May and June together: $500 + $440. That gives us $940.

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many times Pam and Fred rode the rides in total.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. So, Pam rode:
2 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 4 rides

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. So, Fred rode:
4 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 6 rides

Now, let's add up all the rides they took together:
4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets. So, to find out how many tickets they used, we multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
10 rides × 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets

So, Pam and Fred used 60 tickets that day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. From Monday to Wednesday, Walt walked a total of 41 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday:
- Monday: 4 miles
- Tuesday: 24 miles
- Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles

To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles for all three days:
- Total miles from Monday to Wednesday: 41 miles
- Total miles from Monday and Tuesday: 28 miles
- Miles walked on Wednesday: \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Now, we need to find out how much he spends in a whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the subs cost. Rory ordered 2 subs, and each sub costs $7.50. So, we do:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, we calculate the cost of the chips. Rory got 2 bags of chips, and each bag costs $1.50. So, we do:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, we figure out the cost of the cookies. Rory ordered 2 cookies, and each cookie costs $1.00. So, we do:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total before any extra fees:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

Rory also has to pay a 20% delivery fee. To find out how much that is, we take 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the tip to the total cost and the delivery fee:
$20.00 (total cost) + $4.00 (delivery fee) + $5.00 (tip) = $29.00

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how many questions Mark finished in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark can do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 8 hours to do the test.
- So, he did 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he didn't finish is:
- 75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.

For the second test:
- Mark can still do 5 questions in 1 hour.
- He had 6 hours to do this test.
- So, he did 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he didn't finish is:
- 100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions he didn't finish in total, we add the questions he didn't finish from both tests:
- 35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions.

So, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.

We have 20 cars in total. Out of these:
- 12 cars are automatic,
- 4 cars are manual.

To find out how many are semi-automatic, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
20 - 12 - 4 = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

We have 700 bees in total. We need to figure out how many of them are worker bees.

1. First, we know there are twice as many baby bees as queens. So if we have 1 queen, we have 2 baby bees.
2. We also know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So if we have 2 baby bees, we have 4 worker bees.

Let's use some simple numbers to help us understand:
- If we have 1 queen, we have 2 baby bees.
- If we have 2 baby bees, we have 4 worker bees.

Now, let's add these up:
- 1 queen + 2 baby bees + 4 worker bees = 7 bees in total.

But we need to find out how many bees there are in a hive with 700 bees. We can use the same ratio to figure this out.

If 7 bees (1 queen + 2 baby bees + 4 worker bees) make up a small group, we can find out how many of these small groups fit into 700 bees:
- 700 bees ÷ 7 bees per group = 100 groups.

Now, in each group, there are 4 worker bees. So, in 100 groups, there are:
- 100 groups × 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

**Other things (nonfood):**
- Light bulbs cost 3 dollars.
- Cups cost 3 dollars.
- Roach traps cost 4 dollars.
So, the total for nonfood items is:
3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, there's a 10% tax on the nonfood items. To find the tax, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
10% of 10 dollars is:
10 × 0.10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost for the nonfood items, including tax, is:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, we add the cost of the food and the cost of the nonfood items (including tax) to get the total amount John spent:
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

2. **Next, let's see how much stuff Kim needs for each house:**
   - Each house needs 2 bottles of bleach.
   - Each bottle costs $2.
   - So, 2 bottles * $2 = $4 for bleach.
   - Each house also needs 1 pack of cloths.
   - Each pack costs $5.

1 mile is 5280 feet. So:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for each of them to get home. We do this by dividing the distance by their speed.

- Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. So, the time it takes for Steve to get home is:

Shawnda started a bike inflation service. She charges 25 cents for each tire she inflates.

On the first day:
- 5 people came with bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires. So, 5 bicycles mean 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires. So, 3 tricycles mean 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person came with a unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire. So, 1 unicycle means 1 x 1 = 1 tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we need to find out how much 20 tires cost:
20 tires x 25 cents = 500 cents.

We know that 100 cents make 1 dollar, so:

First, we need to figure out how many hours Kimo spends in class each week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
3 classes × 1 hour/class = 3 hours

Since there are 3 days like this in a week, the total for these days is:
3 days × 3 hours/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
2 classes × 2 hours/class = 4 hours

Since there are 2 days like this in a week, the total for these days is:

Now, let's add up the total hours for the whole week:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours per week

Next, we need to find out how many hours Kimo spends in class over the entire semester. The semester is 16 weeks long, so:
17 hours/week × 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how long all the rolls are when put together. Bill makes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, we multiply 300 by 4 to get the total length in inches:
\[ 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert these inches to feet because the question asks for the answer in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 1200 by 12:
\[ 1200 \div 12 = 100 \text{ feet} \]

Now, let's look at the chocolate croissants. Bill makes 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, we multiply 120 by 6 to get the total length in inches:
\[ 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Again, we convert these inches to feet by dividing by 12:
\[ 720 \div 12 = 60 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, we have the baguettes. Bill makes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. So, we multiply 60 by 2 to get the total length in feet:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add up all the lengths:
\[ 100 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} + 120 \text{ feet} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many bananas all the apes eat in one month. We have:
- Monkeys eat 200 bananas
- Gorillas eat 400 bananas
- Baboons eat 100 bananas

So, if we add these up:
200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas in one month.

Now, the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months. So, we need to double the number of bananas:
700 bananas × 2 = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

1400"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They're running on a football field that is 100 yards long.

**Blake:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- So, Blake runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- This is 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- Then, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards.
- So, Kelly runs \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards for this part.
- Adding the first run, Kelly runs \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards in total.

Now, let's find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

So, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

"Okay, let's see. Raphael bought some things for school. He got 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, for the pens, he paid:

4 pens * $1.5 each = $6

Then, he bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, for the notebooks, he paid:

2 notebooks * $4 each = $8

Lastly, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20. 

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add up all the costs:

$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Finn first sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so now he can see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so he can't see them anymore. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.
2. On Tuesday, the tank gets 7 more feet of water. So, we add 7 to 17:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet. To do this, we first find one-third of 24:
   \[
   \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Then, we multiply 8 by 2 to get two-thirds:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Okay, let's count the fish that Anakin and Locsin caught at the beach.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together:
- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish

So, the total number of fish they caught is:
15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we know the starting price of the marbles:**
   - The marbles cost $20 at the start.

2. **Next, we need to understand how the price changes:**
   - Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price.
   - 20% of $20 is $4 (because 20% is the same as 20/100, and 20/100 * 20 = 4).

3. **Now, let's figure out how many times the price will increase in 36 months:**
   - 36 months is the same as 18 two-month periods (because 36 / 2 = 18).

4. **Each time the price increases, it goes up by $4:**
   - So, after 18 increases, the total increase is 18 * $4 = $72.

5. **Finally, we add the total increase to the original price:**
   - The original price is $20, and the total increase is $72.
   - So, the final price is $20 + $72 = $92.

The final price of the marbles after 36 months is $92. 

92"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.
   - So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

So, all the toys together are worth $50.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Jackie has two choices: she can do her taxes herself or hire someone to do it for her.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she won't be able to do 3 hours of work. She usually earns $35 for each hour of work. So, if she can't work for 3 hours, she will lose:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

If Jackie hires an accountant, it will cost her $90.

Now, let's see which option is better for Jackie:
- If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105.
- If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she would lose by doing it herself:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

- The computer with screen, keyboard, and mouse costs €1090.
- The scanner costs €157.
- The CD burner costs €74.
- The printer costs €102.

Now, let's add these up:
1090 + 157 = 1247
1247 + 74 = 1321
1321 + 102 = 1423

So, all the things together cost €1423.

Now, let's see how much money she has left for clothes:
1500 - 1423 = 77

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to get 45 eggs. Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, so we do:
\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs per babysitting} = 5 \text{ times} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 1 year old, Seth would be 2 years old. If Brooke is 2 years old, Seth would be 4 years old, and so on. We can write this as:
   - Seth's age = 2 × Brooke's age

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means:
   - (Seth's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

3. Let's simplify that:
   - Seth's age + 2 + Brooke's age + 2 = 28
   - Seth's age + Brooke's age + 4 = 28
   - Seth's age + Brooke's age = 24

4. Now, we know from step 1 that Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age. So we can replace ""Seth's age"" with ""2 × Brooke's age"" in the equation:
   - 2 × Brooke's age + Brooke's age = 24
   - 3 × Brooke's age = 24

5. To find Brooke's age, we divide both sides by 3:
   - Brooke's age = 24 ÷ 3
   - Brooke's age = 8

6. Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age:
   - Seth's age = 2 × Brooke's age
   - Seth's age = 2 × 8
   - Seth's age = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

On Saturday and Sunday, Pancho walks a bit less. He walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days:
10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekend:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

3. The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket, and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

- Each spider has 8 legs.
- So, the spiders have \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs.

Next, we count the legs of the insects:
- There are 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the insects have \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs.

Finally, we count the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each invertebrate has 10 legs.
- So, the invertebrates have \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Spiders: 640 legs
- Insects: 540 legs
- Invertebrates: 30 legs

Total legs: \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\)

So, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs."

First, we need to find out how much Jessica has to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for all her debts.

1. **Find the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
   \[
   300 + 200 + 500 = 1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - 50% of $1000 is:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.50 = 500
   \]

   So, 50% more than $1000 is:
   \[
   1000 + 500 = 1500

2. **Cutting the Potatoes:**
   - It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
   - For 60 potatoes, it will take \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds.
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 300 seconds is \( 300 \div 60 = 5 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time, we add the time for peeling and the time for cutting.

1. **First, we need to know how much money they made in total.**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - To find out how much they made in total, we need to add the profit to the cost of making the lemonade.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how much it costs to make one gallon of lemonade.**
   - It costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar.
   - So, it costs $3 + $2 = $5 to make one gallon of lemonade.

3. **Now, let's find out how much they sell one gallon of lemonade for.**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - So, they make $0.50 × 20 = $10 from one gallon of lemonade.

4. **We can now set up an equation to find out how many gallons they made.**
   - Let's call the number of gallons they made ""G.""
   - The total money they made is $10 × G.
   - The total cost to make the lemonade is $5 × G.
   - The profit is the total money made minus the total cost: $10 × G - $5 × G = $25.
   - This simplifies to $5 × G = $25.
   - So, G = $25 ÷ $5 = 5 gallons.

5. **Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons.**
   - They made 5 gallons of lemonade.
   - It costs $3 for lemons per gallon.
   - So, they spent $3 × 5 = $15 on lemons.

2. **Next, we find out how much he spends on car fuel:**
   He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Now, we see how much money is left after paying for rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}

\[ 80 \div 4 = 20 \]

So, 1 part of the votes is 20. Since the winner got 3 parts, we multiply 20 by 3:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

The winner got 60 votes. Now, to find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

We have two teams running a race. Each team has four runners, and each runner runs 400 meters. The first team is very even, and each runner takes 55 seconds to run their part. The second team is a bit different; the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 3 seconds less than the first, the third runner takes 3 seconds less than the second, and the fourth runner takes 3 seconds less than the third.

First, let's figure out how long it takes for the first team to finish the race:
- Each runner takes 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.
- So, the total time for the first team is \( 55 \times 4 = 220 \) seconds.

Now, let's figure out how long it takes for the second team to finish the race:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner takes \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner takes \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- So, the total time for the second team is \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we subtract the time of the faster team from the time of the slower team:
- The faster team's time is 220 seconds.
- The slower team's time is 222 seconds.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers that are greater than 3.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
This means there's a 50% chance of rolling a number greater than 3.

### Step 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers.

The chance of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
This means there's a 50% chance of rolling an even number on one roll.

Since we need to roll two even numbers in a row, we multiply the chances:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]
This means there's a 25% chance of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 3: Comparing the Chances
Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.

To find out how much more likely it is, we divide the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]
This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"
"Okay, let's think about this. Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, so that means Jenna picked 10 apples. If we add the apples Jenna and her mom picked together, we get 20 + 10, which is 30 apples.

So, they both picked 30 apples.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

First, we know that:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits, and they get 20 pieces of straw.
- The total number of pieces of straw given out is 160.

We need to find out how many rats are in each cage.

1. **Calculate the straw for the hamsters:**
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - There are 10 hamsters.
   - So, the total straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Calculate the straw for the rabbits:**
   - The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:**
   - Total straw for hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.

4. **Calculate the straw left for the rats:**
   - The total straw given out is 160 pieces.
   - The straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 70 pieces.
   - So, the straw left for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

5. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let's say there are \(r\) rats in each cage.
   - So, the total number of rats is \(3 \times r\).
   - The total straw for the rats is \(3 \times r \times 6 = 18r\).

6. **Set up the equation:**
   - We know the total straw for the rats is 90 pieces.
   - So, \(18r = 90\).

7. **Solve for \(r\):**
   - Divide both sides by 18: \(r = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed that every month, Mandy has to pay an extra 2% of the money she owes. This means that each month, the amount she owes gets a little bigger.

Let's break it down month by month:

1. **First Month:**
   - Mandy owes $100.
   - 2% of $100 is $2.
   - So, after the first month, Mandy owes $100 + $2 = $102.

2. **Second Month:**
   - Now Mandy owes $102.
   - 2% of $102 is $2.04.
   - So, after the second month, Mandy owes $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

3. **Third Month:**
   - Now Mandy owes $104.04.
   - 2% of $104.04 is $2.08.
   - So, after the third month, Mandy owes $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.

So, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

106.12"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to move each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit for each bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.
7. To find out how many bags the trader sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 ÷ $8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. That's the cost of the tickets.

Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than they did on the tickets. So, we need to take $4.50 away from $20.25 to find out how much they spent on food:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
So, they spent $15.75 on food.

Then, they went on two different rides, and each ride cost $33. To find the total cost of the rides, we multiply $33 by 2:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
So, the rides cost $66 in total.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 (tickets) + 15.75 (food) + 66 (rides) = 102 \]
So, the total cost for everything is $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ 34 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

John collects peaches for 3 hours. That's a long time! Now, we need to figure out how many minutes are in 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we can multiply 60 by 3:

60 minutes/hour × 3 hours = 180 minutes

So, John collects peaches for 180 minutes. Now, we know he can collect 2 peaches every minute. To find out how many peaches he collects in 180 minutes, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects each minute:

180 minutes × 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that one duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to stay healthy. If there are ten ducks, we need to find out how much all of them need together in one week.

So, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck × 10 ducks = 35 pounds

This means the ten ducks need 35 pounds of insects in one week.

Now, we need to find out how much they need each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
35 pounds ÷ 7 days = 5 pounds/day

So, the ten ducks need 5 pounds of insects each day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Starting Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees Each Year**: Every year, Tom plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees. So, each year, he adds:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. **After 10 Years**: If Tom adds 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees he adds is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   So, after 10 years, the total number of trees is:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: To find out how many trees are left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, Tom has 91 trees left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, on Friday morning:**
   - Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos in her yard.

2. **Then, on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took away one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is 6.
   - So, they took away 6 pink flamingos and painted them white.
   - Now, Sue has 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
   - They put the 6 white flamingos back in the yard.

3. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the yard.
   - So, now Sue has 12 (from before) + 18 (new ones) = 30 pink flamingos.
   - The number of white flamingos is still 6.

4. **Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Violetta wants to buy 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. So, we need to find out how much 5 crayons cost. We do this by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon:

5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta has $20 to spend. After buying the crayons for $10, we need to find out how much money she has left. We do this by subtracting the cost of the crayons from the money she has:

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means one pen costs $1.50.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

   - Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Then, in the first month, she got more cards:**
   - She got three times the number she had at the beginning.
   - So, she got \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.

3. **In the second month, she got a bit fewer cards:**
   - She got 20 fewer cards than she got in the first month.
   - So, she got \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.

4. **In the third month, she got even more cards:**
   - She got twice the total number of cards she got in the first and second months.
   - The total from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\) cards.

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He edits the same number of sentences for two different publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.
2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents for each sentence. So, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]
3. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. So, Publisher B pays:

   - John wins $5000. This is a one-time thing, so he gets this money right away.

2. **John's weekly pay before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 every week.

3. **John gets a 5% raise:**
   - A 5% raise means he gets 5% more money each week.
   - 5% of $2000 is $100 (because 5% is the same as 5/100, and 5/100 of 2000 is 100).
   - So, his new weekly pay is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

4. **How much does John make in a year with the new pay?**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - With the new pay, John makes $2100 each week.

$10 + $20 = $30

So, Sara still needs:
$70 - $30 = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get $40, we divide $40 by $4:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Jerry has some red chickens and some white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has.

1. Let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Now, let's write an equation for the total number of eggs:

- Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, so \( R \) red chickens lay \( 3R \) eggs.
- Each white chicken lays 5 eggs, so \( R + 2 \) white chickens lay \( 5(R + 2) \) eggs.

The total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so we can write:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, expand the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

2. Combine like terms:
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

3. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we do:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. On the first day, Sloane saw 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she saw 50 more customers than the first day. So, she saw 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. By the third day, the total number of customers was 500.

Now, we need to find out how many customers she saw on the third day. We know the total for three days is 500, and we already know the first two days:

- First day: 100 customers
- Second day: 150 customers

So, the total for the first two days is:
100 + 150 = 250 customers

To find out how many customers were on the third day, we subtract the total for the first two days from the total for all three days:
500 - 250 = 250 customers

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Imagine we have two pools: a big one and a small one. Both pools have a tiny hole that lets out 4 gallons of water every minute. 

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We need to find out how much water is in the small pool right now.

Let's call the amount of water in the small pool right now ""S"" gallons. 

1. **Four minutes ago:**
   - The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
   - The big pool had \( 4S + 16 \) gallons (because it also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).

2. **Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:**
   - So, \( 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \).

Let's solve this equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water right now.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money Lori needs in total. She wants to buy shoes that cost $320.00 and a belt that costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Now, we know Lori needs $352.00 in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many hours she has to work to earn this amount. Lori earns $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 ÷ 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, Janeth borrowed $2000. She said she would give back 10% more. So, we need to find out what 10% of $2000 is.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, she needs to give back:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Now, Janeth is going to pay $165 every month for 12 months. Let's find out how much she will pay in total over these 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find out how much she still owes after 12 months, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth will still owe:
\[ 220 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 4 roses in the vase. The problem says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if we have 4 roses, we add 7 more to get the number of dahlias:

4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the roses and the dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. So, Adrian is:
   \[

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. So, Zack is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, let's think about how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet will be:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Naomi's Score**: We know Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. Half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than 34 is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, 17 more than 68 is 85. Brianna scored 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

Adding these together:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:

Next, we need to find out how long she spent on the sudoku puzzles:
- She did 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Each sudoku puzzle takes 5 minutes.
- So, 8 puzzles * 5 minutes each = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Time on crossword puzzles: 30 minutes
- Time on sudoku puzzles: 40 minutes
- Total time: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

First, we start with 120 liters of water in the tank. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after she uses 90 liters.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

So, 30 liters of water are left in the tank.

Next, Celine collects rainwater. She collects twice as much as what is left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, she collects:

2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the 60 liters of rainwater to the 30 liters that were already in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

90 liters"

Next, he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, we need to take 40 away from 90 to find out how many petunias he plants:
90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the geraniums and the petunias together:
90 + 50 = 140 flowers.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers!"

First, the company spends $15000 on advertising for one year. That's a big number, right?

Then, for the next year, they spend only a third of that amount. To find a third, we divide $15000 by 3. So, $15000 ÷ 3 = $5000.

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the two amounts together: $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

So, the company spent $20000 on advertising over the two years.

Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.

Next, we need to find out how much Benji pays for the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 for each hour, and Benji uses it for 5 hours. So, we do:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
Benji pays $90 for the raft.

Now, to find out how much they pay together, we add what Carlos pays and what Benji pays:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how many Pokemon cards James has at the start:
- He has 30 fire type cards.
- He has 20 grass type cards.
- He has 40 water type cards.

So, the total number of cards he starts with is:
30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

Now, some things happen:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so he now has:
40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Let's count the total number of cards he has now:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the new total is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

Now, we want to find out what the chance is that if James picks a card at random, it will be a water type card. To do this, we use a simple formula:
\[ \text{Chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

To make it easier, let's simplify \(\frac{32}{96}\):
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we calculate:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, 33.33% rounds to 33%.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

- Meal upgrade (chips and drink): $3.00

Let's add all these costs together:
- $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

2. **Mom's Speed:**
   - Kalinda's mom can put half as many pieces together as Kalinda.
   - So, Kalinda's mom can put 2 pieces together every minute.

3. **Together:**
   - If Kalinda and her mom work together, they can put 4 pieces (Kalinda) + 2 pieces (Mom) = 6 pieces together every minute.

4. **Total Pieces:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.

5. **Time to Finish:**
   - To find out how long it will take them to finish the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together each minute.
   - So, 360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

First, the farm had 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn went to the farm after two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready to be picked. To find out how many that is, we do:

120 watermelons × 30% = 120 × 0.30 = 36 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left:

120 watermelons - 36 watermelons = 84 watermelons

Two weeks later, Ashlyn went back to the farm. This time, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready to be picked. To find out how many that is, we do:

84 watermelons × 3/4 = 84 × 0.75 = 63 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took 63 more watermelons home. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left:

84 watermelons - 63 watermelons = 21 watermelons

So, after two weeks, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested.

   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - So, the total cost of the cars is \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Next, we calculate the tax:**
   - The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars.
   - 10% of 240,000 is \( 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Then, we add the registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - For 12 cars, the total registration fee is \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Finally, we add everything together:**
   - The total cost of the cars is 240,000 dollars.
   - The tax is 24,000 dollars.
   - The registration fees are 12,000 dollars.
   - So, the total amount Mark pays is \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, Mark pays 276,000 dollars for everything."

First, we have two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. We need to find out how many more snails are in the bigger aquarium compared to the smaller one. 

To do this, we subtract the number of snails in the smaller aquarium from the number of snails in the bigger aquarium:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

So, there are 28 more snails in the bigger aquarium.

Now, the problem says that this difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. This means if we add up all the fish in both aquariums, the number we get should be half of 28.

Let's find half of 28:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in total in both aquariums.

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we need to divide the total number of fish by 2 to find out how many fish are in each aquarium:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer:
7"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a big puzzle!

1. The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour of work.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times every week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, let's find out how much the makeup artist charges for one day:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]
So, it costs $1500 for one day of makeup.

Next, let's find out how much it costs for one week:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]
So, it costs $6000 for one week of makeup.

Now, let's find out how much it costs for the whole movie, which is 5 weeks:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]
So, it costs $30,000 for the whole movie.

But wait! The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because she did a lot of work. Let's find out how much the discount is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]
So, the discount is $3000.

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \]

So, Jean paid:
\[ 27000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to add up all the money Isabelle spent on the party stuff:
- She spent $12 on cake ingredients.
- She spent $43 on birthday presents.
- She spent $15 on decorations.
- She spent $4 on invitations.
- She spent $22 on goodie bags.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Next, we need to split this cost three ways, because Isabelle and her two parents are sharing the cost. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32.

Each person pays $32."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply 4 by 50:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much the onions cost. We know that 1 pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total pounds by the cost per pound:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300 on onions.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 times 5, which is 20 cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 times 13, which is 26 cookies.

2. **Now, let's add up all the cookies:**
   - Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total.
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

3. **Next, let's find out how many calories each of them ate:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue ate 46 cookies, so she ate 46 times 200 calories, which is 9200 calories.
   - Her sister ate 18 cookies, so she ate 18 times 200 calories, which is 3600 calories.

4. **Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister:**
   - Sue ate 9200 calories, and her sister ate 3600 calories.
   - The difference is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

So, Sue ate 5600 more calories than her sister.

1. **Total Students in the School:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - So, the total number of students is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Total Number of Girls and Boys:**
   - The school is 50% girls and 50% boys.
   - So, there are \(60 \div 2 = 30\) girls and \(60 \div 2 = 30\) boys.

3. **Girls in Each Class:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Girls in the Third Class:**
   - Since there are 30 girls in total and 27 are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Boys in the Third Class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - So, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

1. **Last night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars than last night. So, he killed:
     \[
     15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars}
     \]
   - Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars today. So, he killed:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves}

3. **Total animals killed today:**
   - Wolves: 36
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total today:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. That's a lot of slides!

Next, we need to figure out how many times Anne went down the slide. The problem says she went down 30% less than Mitchel. 

To find 30% of 30, we do:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. If Mitchel went 30 times, then Anne went:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. The problem says Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.

So, if Anne went 21 times, then Robert went:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \] times.

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times!

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. He wants to put these new cows into 20 stalls, so he divides them equally. Each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows, and with the new cows, each stall has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. If each stall has 22 cows, then 8 stalls will have:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"Okay, let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank step by step!

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, he has $1.00.
2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are 40 * 5 = 200 cents. Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, 200 cents is $2.00.
3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are 20 * 10 = 200 cents. Again, 200 cents is $2.00.
4. **Dollar bills**: Brady has 40 dollar bills. Each dollar bill is worth $1.00, so 40 dollar bills are 40 * $1.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- $1.00 (pennies)
- $2.00 (nickels)
- $2.00 (dimes)
- $40.00 (dollar bills)

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we need to know how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
   \[
   200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, to find the total weight of the tree, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
   \[
   20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Now, the termites ate 30% of the tree. To find out how much weight that is, we need to calculate 30% of 8000 pounds. We do this by multiplying 8000 by 0.30:
   \[
   8000 \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Finally, to find the weight of the tree after the termites ate some of it, we subtract the weight the termites ate from the total weight:
   \[
   8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

8 books * 50 cents/book = 400 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 400 cents is the same as 4 dollars.

Next, there's a flat fee of 2 dollars for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. We need to add this to the amount she already owes:
4 dollars + 2 dollars = 6 dollars

So, Nancy has to pay a total of 6 dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know Andrea has 52 apples. The problem says Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if we take away 8 apples from Andrea's 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has:
   - 52 - 8 = 44 apples
   So, Jamal has 44 apples.

2. Next, the problem tells us that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has by adding 4 to his apples:
   - 44 + 4 = 48 bananas
   So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

3. Now, the problem says Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2:
   - 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas
   So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

4. Finally, we need to find out the total number of fruits. We add up all the apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
   - Andrea's apples: 52
   - Andrea's bananas: 24
   - Jamal's apples: 44
   - Jamal's bananas: 48

   Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168

First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add those together:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]
So, Carla is making 66 cookies in total.

Next, we need to figure out how much flour she needs. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. So, we need to find out how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies. We do this by dividing 66 by 12:
\[ 66 \div 12 = 5.5 \]
This means there are 5.5 sets of 12 cookies in 66 cookies.

Since each set of 12 cookies needs 2 cups of flour, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies.

2. Now, to find two-thirds, we multiply one-third by 2:
   \[
   3100 \times 2 = 6200 \text{ pennies}

Next, we need to convert these 6,200 pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we can:

3. Divide 6,200 pennies by 100:

Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house, and she has $400,000 to spend. The house she likes costs $350,000. But there are extra costs too: a brokerage fee and a transfer fee.

First, let's find out how much the brokerage fee is. It's 5% of the house price:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's find out how much the transfer fee is. It's 12% of the house price:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = \frac{12}{100} \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{House price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. So, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   He had to pay 3% of the selling price for transfer fees. 
   So, 3% of $400,000 is:
   \[
   0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]
   So, the transfer fees are $12,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   He also had to pay 5% of the selling price for the brokerage fee.
   So, 5% of $400,000 is:
   \[
   0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]
   So, the brokerage fee is $20,000.

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   Mr. Tan still owed $250,000 on the house loan.

5. **Total Expenses:**
   Now, we add up all the expenses:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000

   - 40% of 20 is \( 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \) minutes.
   - So, it takes 8 minutes longer to heat to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, it takes \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes to heat from 300 to 400 degrees.
3. The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
   - \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.
4. After the oil is heated, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil.

So, she spent $2400 on celery seeds.

Now, to find out the total amount of money she spent, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together:
\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \]

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, the song:**
   - Sean has to memorize 54 lines for his solo song.

2. **Next, the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song.
   - So, \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) lines in the first scene.
   - But only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( 108 \div 3 = 36 \) lines are Sean's in the first scene.

3. **Then, the second scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - So, \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines in the second scene.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \( 60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48 \) lines are Sean's in the second scene.

4. **Finally, let's add them all up:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48
   - Total lines Sean has to memorize: \( 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \)

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, Carly has 80 cards. Out of these, 2 out of every 5 cards have the letter A. So, we need to find out how many cards that is:
\[ 80 \times \frac{2}{5} = 32 \]
So, 32 cards have the letter A.

Now, we have 80 cards in total, and 32 of them have A, so the remaining cards are:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, half of these remaining cards have the letter B. So, we need to find half of 48:
\[ 48 \times \frac{1}{2} = 24 \]
So, 24 cards have the letter B.

Now, we have 48 cards left, and 24 of them have B, so the remaining cards are:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5 out of every 8 of these remaining cards have the letter C. So, we need to find out how many cards that is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{5}{8} = 15 \]
So, 15 cards have the letter C.

Finally, we have 24 cards left, and 15 of them have C, so the remaining cards are:
\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that have the letter D on them is 9.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole, and he needs to dig 30 small holes. So, we multiply 3 minutes by 30:
\[ 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole, and he needs to dig 15 large holes. So, we multiply 10 minutes by 15:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Okay, let's think about this. Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

20 (current total age) + 10 (for Mico) + 10 (for Marco) = 40

So, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 40.

40"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Ruby is 6 times as old as Sam. So if Sam is, say, 1 year old, Ruby would be 6 years old. If Sam is 2 years old, Ruby would be 12 years old, and so on. We can write this as:
   \[ R = 6S \]
   where \( R \) is Ruby's age and \( S \) is Sam's age.

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So if Sam is \( S \) years old now, in 9 years, Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old. Ruby, who is \( R \) years old now, will be \( R + 9 \) years old. We can write this as:
   \[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

3. Now, let's use the first equation \( R = 6S \) and substitute it into the second equation:
   \[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

4. Let's solve this step by step:
   - First, expand the right side of the equation:
     \[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
   - Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to get all the \( S \) terms on one side:
     \[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \]
     \[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
   - Then, subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the \( 3S \) term:
     \[ 3S = 18 \]
   - Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
     \[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"Okay, let's do this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much Peter spent on the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs 25 cents. So, we multiply 20 by 25 cents:
20 popsicles * 25 cents = 500 cents

Now, we need to convert 500 cents to dollars. Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, we divide 500 by 100:
500 cents ÷ 100 = $5.00

Next, let's figure out how much he spent on the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs 50 cents. So, we multiply 4 by 50 cents:
4 ice cream bars * 50 cents = 200 cents

Again, we convert 200 cents to dollars:
200 cents ÷ 100 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter spent:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. The problem says that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if we divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2, we can find out how many spots a mamba has:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras and mambas have together. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the spots from the cobras and the mambas to get the total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

The problem asks for half the number of spots they all have combined. So, we divide the total number of spots by 2:

\[ 4900 \div 2 = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many people are coming to the soccer game. We have:
- 12 team members
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 guests
- 3 coaches

So, the total number of people is:
12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas we need. Each pizza can serve 3 people. So, we divide the total number of people by 3:
39 ÷ 3 = 13 pizzas

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:
13 x 15 = 195

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

195"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Katerina makes pretty necklaces with topaz stones. Each necklace has 8 topaz stones, and each stone is 1 inch long. So, the topaz stones take up 8 inches of the necklace.

The whole necklace is 25 inches long. If 8 inches are taken by the topaz stones, then the rest of the necklace, which is 25 - 8 = 17 inches, is filled with silver beads.

Each silver bead is very small, only 1/4 of an inch long. To find out how many silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4.

17 ÷ 1/4 = 17 × 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 silver beads for each necklace.

68"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, in the second week, they each wrote double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
- Total stories: \(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth 5 times 25 cents, which is 125 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth 2 times 10 cents, which is 20 cents.

Now, let's add these together:
125 cents (from the quarters) + 20 cents (from the dimes) = 145 cents

Kelly has 145 cents in total.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know the flag has 76 stars in total. We also know there are three rows with 8 stars each and two rows with 6 stars each. Let's figure out how many stars are in these rows.

For the three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

For the two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many stars are left for the 5-star rows. We do this by subtracting the stars we already counted from the total number of stars:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

\[ 75 \text{ pounds} \times 80 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the total weight of the flagstones is 6000 pounds. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ 6000 \text{ pounds} \div 2000 \text{ pounds/truck} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport all the flagstones.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know the car in the fast lane is going 60 miles every hour. The car in the slow lane is going half as fast, so it's going 30 miles every hour.

Now, the car in the fast lane went 480 miles. We need to find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to go the same 480 miles.

To do this, we use a simple trick: we divide the total distance by the speed. So, for the slow car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

If we do the math, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

1. **First, we know how many medals Ali has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.

2. **Next, we figure out how many medals Izzy has:**
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - So, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

3. **Now, we add up the medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

4. **Finally, we need to find out how many medals have been given out in total:**
   - Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 4 by 6:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
So, the adults get 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide 16 by 8:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]
So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. That's 3 hours.
2. But she takes a break for half an hour, so she only works for 2 and a half hours.
3. Now, 2 and a half hours is the same as 2 hours and 30 minutes.
4. We need to change this to minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, and adding 30 minutes gives us 150 minutes.
5. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute blocks are in 150 minutes.
6. We divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15.
7. Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute block, we multiply 15 by $5.
8. 15 times 5 is 75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

2. **Now, let's see what happens in the fourth round:**
   - If a player has more than 20 points, they get an extra point.
   - Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point: 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

3. **Finally, let's add up all the points:**
   - Mike has 22 points.
   - Jim has 18 points.

"Okay, let's count how many exercises Darren did over two days.

On the first day:
- He did 100 pushups.
- He did 50 squats.
- He did 20 dumbbell presses.

On the second day:

- He did 10 fewer squats than the first day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats.
- He did double the dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up all the exercises he did over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much rice the whole family eats in one meal. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice, and there are 5 people in the family. So, we do:
\[ 0.2 \text{ kg} \times 5 = 1 \text{ kg} \]
This means the family eats 1 kg of rice in one meal.

Next, we need to know how much rice they eat in one day. They eat rice twice a day, so:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]
So, the family eats 2 kg of rice each day.

Now, we need to find out how much rice they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]
This means the family eats 14 kg of rice in one week.

Finally, we need to figure out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount they eat in one week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

   - John goes to work and comes back, so he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back. That's 30 + 30 = 60 miles each day.

2. **How many miles does John travel each week?**
   - John goes to work 5 days a week. So, he travels 60 miles each day for 5 days. That's 60 * 5 = 300 miles each week.

3. **How many miles does John travel each year?**
   - John works 50 weeks a year. So, he travels 300 miles each week for 50 weeks. That's 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles each year.

4. **How much does John pay for the miles driven?**
   - John pays $2 for each mile. So, for 15,000 miles, he pays 15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

5. **How much does John pay in bonuses each year?**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month. There are 12 months in a year, so he pays 150 * 12 = $1,800 in bonuses each year.

2. **Next, we figure out how many books she has sold in total:**
   - She started with 250 books.
   - If she has 50 books left, she must have sold 250 - 50 = 200 books.

3. **Now, we know how many books she sold this year:**
   - She sold 45 books this year.

4. **We also know how many books she sold in the first year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year.
   - So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

5. **To find out how many books she sold in the second year, we add up the books sold in the first and third years and subtract from the total:**
   - Books sold in the first year = 90
   - Books sold this year (third year) = 45
   - Total books sold = 200
   - Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books.

6. **Finally, we calculate how much money she made in the second year:**

   - So, Watson worked \( 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ days} \).

2. **How many hours did Watson work in April?**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - So, he worked \( 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ hours} \).

3. **How much money did Watson earn from his hourly wage?**
   - Watson earns $10 per hour.
   - So, he earned \( 200 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2000 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **How much money did Watson get as a bonus?**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - So, he got \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **How much money did Watson make in total in April?**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2000.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - So, Watson made \( 2000 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3200 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"Okay, let's think about this. John arm wrestles 20 people and he wins 80% of the time. 

First, we need to find out how many people he beats. To do that, we take 80% of 20. 

80% is the same as 80 out of 100, or 0.80. So, we multiply 20 by 0.80:

20 × 0.80 = 16

This means John beats 16 people. 

Now, to find out how many people he loses to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestles:

20 - 16 = 4

So, John loses to 4 people.

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread every day.
2. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. To find out how many that is, we can do:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to find out how many are left:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of what's left. So, half of 20 loaves is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, in the afternoon, they sell:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

So, the bakery sells 5 loaves of bread in the afternoon.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, if we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks, we get:
   \[
   8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to see how many 2-pound losses fit into 8 pounds. We can do this by dividing 8 pounds by 2 pounds per 4 weeks:
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4
   \]
   But since Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, we need to multiply 4 by 4:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Ice Cream Savings:**
   - One tub of ice cream used to cost $13, but now it costs $11.
   - So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub.
   - If you buy 2 tubs, you save 2 * $2 = $4.

2. **Milk Savings:**
   - Each packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0.5.
   - If you buy 4 packets, you save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

3. **Total Savings:**
   - From the ice cream, you save $4.
   - From the milk, you save $2.
   - So, the total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

You will save $6 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Helena's special potion makes people grow extra arms and legs. Here's how it works:
- Every 3 days, a person gets a new arm.
- Every 5 days, a person gets a new leg.

We need to find out how many new arms and legs a person will have after 15 days.

First, let's count the new arms:
- After 3 days: 1 new arm
- After 6 days: 2 new arms
- After 9 days: 3 new arms
- After 12 days: 4 new arms
- After 15 days: 5 new arms

So, in 15 days, a person gets 5 new arms.

Now, let's count the new legs:
- After 5 days: 1 new leg
- After 10 days: 2 new legs
- After 15 days: 3 new legs

So, in 15 days, a person gets 3 new legs.

Now, let's add the new arms and new legs together:
- New arms: 5
- New legs: 3
- Total new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8

So, after 15 days, a person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Theo buys 6 business suits. Each suit costs $100. So, the total cost for the suits is:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, he buys 3 suitcases. Each suitcase costs $50. So, the total cost for the suitcases is:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's figure out the cost of the flight ticket. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit. Since one suit costs $100, 5 times that is:
5 * $100 = $500
And $700 more than that is:
$500 + $700 = $1200

So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip. So, out of his $6000, he plans to spend:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many eggs the family eats each day. There are 5 people in the family. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

For the three people who eat 3 eggs each:
3 people × 3 eggs = 9 eggs

For the two people who eat 2 eggs each:
2 people × 2 eggs = 4 eggs

Now, we add these together to find the total number of eggs eaten each day:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Next, we need to find out how many eggs they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of eggs eaten each day by 7:
13 eggs/day × 7 days = 91 eggs

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Cera's Age:**
   - Cera is 46 years old now.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - If Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - If the population six years ago was 60,000, then the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the current population of Chile is 120,000."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have a football team with 105 players. We need to figure out how many players are on the defense.

Here's what we know:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as on the defense.

Let's use a simple letter to represent the number of players on the defense. We'll call it ""D.""

So:
- The number of players on the offense is 2 times D, which is 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half of D, which is D/2.

Now, we add all these players together to get the total number of players on the team:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's add these up:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply everything by 2:
\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 7 to find D:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many people Martha invited to her party. She invited:
- 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 people.
- 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 people.

Now, if we add these together, we get:
12 people + 12 people = 24 people invited in total.

Next, we need to find out how many people couldn't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the sick people had other plans. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
8 people (sick) + 2 people (other plans) = 10 people.

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 people (invited) - 10 people (couldn't come) = 14 people.

So, 14 people showed up for Martha's party!"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in his store.

   - 2/5 of 20 is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
- Marbles from Johanna: 20
- Marbles he already had: 50
- Marbles from his father: 8

Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of all the marbles is:
- Total weight = 78 marbles × 2 kg/marble = 156 kg

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to fill the pool. We know it costs $0.1 for each cubic foot of water. So, we multiply the total volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot:

120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot = $12

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

2. **Next, we figure out how many people left after an hour:**
   - The problem says 1/4 of the people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 is 40 ÷ 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Now, we find out how many people are still at the party:**
   - If 10 people left, then 40 - 10 = 30 people are still there.

4. **We know how many men are still at the party:**
   - The problem says 22 men stayed.

5. **Finally, we figure out how many women are still at the party:**
   - If 30 people are still there and 22 of them are men, then the rest must be women.

First, we know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 extra pencils, and all together, she has 26 pencils. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box.

If we take away the 2 extra pencils, we have:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, the 24 pencils are in the three boxes. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we divide 24 by 3:
\[ 24 \div 3 = 8 \]

So, each box has 8 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many pencils Jam and her sister Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8:

1. **First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are:**
   - The company has 100 people in total.
   - Junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of people.
   - So, we calculate 2/5 of 100:
     \[
     \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

2. **Next, we find out how many senior programmers there are:**
   - If there are 100 people in total and 40 are junior programmers, then the rest must be senior programmers.
   - So, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of people:
     \[
     \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Now, let's figure out how much each type of programmer gets paid:**
   - Junior programmers get paid $2000 each month.
   - Senior programmers get paid $400 more than junior programmers, so:
     \[
     \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
     \]

4. **Let's calculate the total amount paid to all junior programmers:**
   - There are 40 junior programmers, and each gets $2000.
   - So, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their monthly salary:
     \[
     \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

5. **Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to all senior programmers:**
   - There are 60 senior programmers, and each gets $2400.
   - So, we multiply the number of senior programmers by their monthly salary:
     \[
     \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000

2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became ""P + 5.""

3. At the second stop, 7 people got off, and 8 more people got on. So, the number of people on the bus changed to ""P + 5 - 7 + 8.""

4. We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So, we can write:

5. Now, let's simplify the equation:
   \[
   P + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20

- Nick gets $15 for each hour he works.
- He works 2000 hours a year.
- So, his total pay is \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars.
- But he has to pay 20% of this in taxes.
- The tax he pays is \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars.
- So, the money he has left after taxes is \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

**Job B:**
- Nick gets $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- So, after paying property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- He also has to pay 10% of this in taxes.
- The tax he pays is \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars.
- So, the money he has left after all taxes is \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know there are 220 castles in Scotland. Out of these, 40 percent are ruins. To find out how many castles are ruins, we need to calculate 40 percent of 220.

40 percent of 220 is:
\[ 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we're told that half of these ruined castles are unmanned. To find out how many are unmanned, we need to divide 88 by 2.

\[ 88 \div 2 = 44 \]

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much Robert will pay in total for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- He pays $1,350 right away.
- Then, he pays $350 every month for 6 months.
- So, the monthly payments add up to $350 * 6 = $2,100.
- Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

For Cozy Homes:
- He pays $1,100 right away.
- Then, he pays $250 every month for 9 months.
- So, the monthly payments add up to $250 * 9 = $2,250.
- Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, to find the difference between the two offers:
- We subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes from the total cost of Furniture United.
- The difference is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We have four friends: Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ. They all have paintball guns, and we want to find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared all their guns equally.

First, let's count how many guns they have in total:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Jason (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Now, let's add them all up:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns in total.

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the four friends. To do this, we divide the total number of guns by the number of friends:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they share the guns equally, each friend would have 6 guns.

First, we need to figure out how much sugar Mason needs for the suckers. He needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers. If he wants to make 8 batches, we multiply 30 by 8:

30 ounces × 8 = 240 ounces

Next, we need to figure out how much sugar he needs for the fudge. He needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge. Since he's only making one batch, he needs:

70 ounces

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:

240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, Maria buys 8 shares of a stock, and each share costs $8. So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

Next, the stock price goes up by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we add 50% of $8 to $8:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } \$8 = \frac{50}{100} \times 8 = \$4 \]
So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares, and each is worth $12. So, the total value of her shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price goes down by 25%. To find the new price, we subtract 25% of $12 from $12:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$12 = \frac{25}{100} \times 12 = \$3 \]
So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares, and each is worth $9. So, the total value of her shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ 6 \div 2 = 3 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. Luke ate 2 hot dogs, and John ate 3 hot dogs. So, John ate:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ more hot dog} \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

We have 200 students in total, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups ""x."" So, the smallest group will have ""x - 10"" students.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of students:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to find x:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than 70, which means:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. We need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

1. First, let's figure out how many cows and chickens there are.
2. If we say the number of cows is \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \) because there are twice as many chickens as cows.
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
6. So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ chickens}
   \]

Now, let's count the legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:
  \[
  20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]

Adding the legs together:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160.

4. On the day of the talent show, he drops 3 balls.
5. So, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left.
6. But 2 of the dropped balls are caught and given back to him.
7. So, he now has 4 + 2 = 6 balls.
8. Unfortunately, one ball gets lost in the dark.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Next, Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, if we add 5 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A, we get:
4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars for Juice Box B.

Now, Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, if we add 7 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A, we get:
4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars for Juice Box C.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

First, we need to find out how much money the factory used to make each day when they made tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was worth $100. So, we do:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors} \times 100 \text{ dollars per tractor} = 1000 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the factory makes each day now that they make silos. They sell 5 silos a day, and each silo is worth $220. So, we do:
\[ 5 \text{ silos} \times 220 \text{ dollars per silo} = 1100 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money they are making each day. We subtract the old amount from the new amount:
\[ 1100 \text{ dollars per day} - 1000 \text{ dollars per day} = 100 \text{ dollars more per day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making, we divide the extra money by the old amount and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

   - So, for one month, the food costs: $25 x 4 = $100.

2. **Treats for the dog:**
   - The treats cost $20 every month.
   - So, for one month, the treats cost: $20.

3. **Medicine for the dog:**
   - The medicine costs $100 every month.
   - So, for one month, the medicine costs: $100.

4. **Total cost for one month:**

First, we know John spent 6 hours boating. He also spent half that time swimming, so he spent 3 hours swimming. That's 6 + 3 = 9 hours so far.

Next, he watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long. So, he spent 3 × 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up all the time he spent on these activities:
9 hours (boating and swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

The problem says that these 15 hours are 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up a simple equation:
15 hours = 30% of total time.

To find the total time, we divide 15 by 30% (which is the same as 0.30):
15 ÷ 0.30 = 50 hours.

So, John spent 50 hours on his vacation in total.

Now, the problem says he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
40% of 50 = 0.40 × 50 = 20 hours.

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

3. After buying the candy, he has some money left, and he spends half of that money on gumballs.
4. Each gumball costs 5 cents, and he buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs:
- Each gumball costs 5 cents, so 40 gumballs cost \( 40 \times 5 = 200 \) cents.
- 200 cents is the same as $2.

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs was:
- $2 (spent on gumballs) \times 2 = $4.

Now, let's find out how much money Billy spent on the candy:
- He started with $10 and had $4 left as change, so he spent \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars on candy.

Finally, let's figure out how many pounds of candy he bought:
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds he bought is \( 6 \div 1.5 = 4 \) pounds.

   - From the second city to the third city, it goes 100 miles.
   - From the third city back to the first city, it goes 50 miles less than the total of the first two trips. So, we add 75 miles and 100 miles to get 175 miles, and then subtract 50 miles: 
     \[
     175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}

2. **Next, we need to find out how far the train travels in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips each day.
   - So, the total distance in one day is:

First, we need to figure out how much stuffing goes into a collie bed. We know:
- A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.

To find out how much a collie bed needs, we take the average of these two amounts. We add 8 and 2, which gives us 10, and then we divide by 2:
\[ \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]
So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
- Each chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- For 4 chihuahua beds, we multiply 2 by 4:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, 4 chihuahua beds need 8 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 3 collie beds:
- Each collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.
- For 3 collie beds, we multiply 5 by 3:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]
So, 3 collie beds need 15 pounds of stuffing.

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, John drives to his friend's house. The trip is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 more miles. So, the total distance to his friend's house is:
200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

John drives at 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed:
210 miles ÷ 70 miles per hour = 3 hours

Next, John drives back home. The route home is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 miles per hour. To find out how long this part of the trip takes, we divide the distance by the speed:
240 miles ÷ 80 miles per hour = 3 hours

Now, we add the time for both parts of the trip:
3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

So, the total time for the trip is 6 hours.

1. First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.
2. Out of these, 43 are girls. So, the number of boys is:
   \[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]
3. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys who were at school is:
   \[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

"Okay, let's think about this. If there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice that, then we need to find out how many boys there are first. 

To find the number of boys, we multiply the number of girls by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, there are 18 kids in the park.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Jane needs to get at least 42 points in total from 3 tests to move to the next school year. She already got 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. 

First, let's add the points she already has:
15 + 18 = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 42 points. We do this by subtracting the points she has from the total points needed:
42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. That's easy to remember, right?

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So, we do:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]
Then we subtract 5:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over things on sale. So, we do:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 people were kicked out for fighting.

Now, let's add up all the people we know were kicked out:
\[ 3 \text{ (masks)} + 7 \text{ (shoplifting)} + 21 \text{ (fighting)} = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number we already know from 50:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons. 

The answer is:

2. After Erin scores 14 more points, she has three times as many points as Sara.
3. Three times Sara's points is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
4. So, after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
5. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to take away the 14 points she just scored from her total of 24 points.
6. \(24 - 14 = 10\).

So, Erin had 10 points before she scored the 14 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a big puzzle!

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - So, the total cost for the picture frames is \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, the additional cost for etching all the frames is \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the pins is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - 1/4 of 44 is \( 44 \div 4 = 11 \) seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for the cords is \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs:
   - Picture frames: $880
   - Etching: $176
   - Pins: $10
   - Cords: $132
   - Total: \( 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

If the wallpaper costs $400 at the store, and Ethan can save 20% by making it himself, we need to find out what 20% of $400 is. 

To find 20% of $400, we can do:
\[ 20 \div 100 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making it himself. Now, we need to subtract the savings from the original price to find out how much it costs him to make it.

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, Ethan's total cost for making the wallpaper is $320.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

So, the store sold 100 tennis shoes by the end of the sale.

On Saturday, she dances for twice as long as on Tuesday. So, that's 2 times 1 hour, which is 2 hours. It's like watching two more episodes of a cartoon show.

Now, let's add all the hours together:
- Tuesday: 1 hour

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. Some of the equipment was faulty. The faulty equipment was 40% of the total.
3. To find out how much the faulty equipment cost, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

To find 40% of $400,000:
\[ 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment cost $160,000.

4. Now, we need to find out how much the good (functioning) equipment cost. We do this by subtracting the cost of the faulty equipment from the total cost.

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the company spent $240,000 on the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, let's find out how much milk she gets from the first 15 sheep:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

Next, let's find out how much milk she gets from the other 15 sheep:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the milk from both groups:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Double of 12 is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples.

Now, let's add up all the apples she picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

1. **First, we need to find out how much extra money (interest) Karan has to pay.**

   - Karan borrowed $3,650.
   - The interest rate is 10%.
   - She borrowed the money for 5 months.

   To find the interest, we use a simple formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   - Principal (the amount borrowed) = $3,650
   - Rate (10% as a decimal) = 0.10
   - Time (5 months as a fraction of a year) = 5/12

   So, the interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]

   Let's break it down:
   \[
   3650 \times 0.10 = 365
   \]
   \[
   365 \times \frac{5}{12} = 365 \times 0.4167 \approx 152.50
   \]

   So, the interest is $152.50.

2. **Next, we add the interest to the amount borrowed to find the total amount Karan has to pay back.**

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much Karan has to pay each month.**

   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} = 760.50

Next, we need to find out how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe. We subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:

Axel's silver pesos: 50
Anna's silver pesos: 100
Total silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150

Axel's gold pesos: 80

2. **How much money will Millie make if she sells all the lemonade?**
   - She sells each cup for $1.
   - So, 36 cups × $1 per cup = $36.

3. **How much did Millie spend on supplies?**
   - Millie spent $18 on supplies.

4. **What is Millie's total profit?**
   - Total profit = Total money made - Cost of supplies

Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he still has 2/5 of his land left. We know that the land he has left is 12.8 hectares.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 whole (or 5/5) of his land would be. Since 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, we can find out what 1/5 of his land is by dividing 12.8 by 2:

12.8 ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares

So, 1/5 of his land is 6.4 hectares. Now, to find out how much land he had at first, we need to find out what 5/5 of his land is. We do this by multiplying 6.4 by 5:

Tim used to pay $60 every month for his cable TV. Now, he's going to use streaming services instead. Let's see how much he will pay for these new services and how much he will save.

1. **Netflix:** This costs $10 every month.
2. **Hulu and Disney Plus:** Each of these costs $10 every month, but Tim gets a 20% discount for having both. 

First, let's find out how much 20% of $20 is:
- 20% of $20 is \( \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.

So, the discount is $4. Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add up all the costs for the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
- Total: $10 + $16 = $26

Tim used to pay $60 for cable, and now he will pay $26 for streaming services. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:
- $60 - $26 = $34

3. She also spends 90 minutes editing the song.

Now, let's add up all the time she spent:
- Writing: 240 minutes
- Recording: 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes

Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find out what percentage of her total time she spent editing, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. That's a lot of cards!

Then, her dad gave her 2 boxes of pre-made cards. Each box has 15 cards, so that's 15 cards in one box and 15 cards in the other box. If we add those together, we get:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

So, now Erica has:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]
That's 50 cards in total!

Next, Erica passed out some cards. She gave 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. If we add those together, we get:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \]

So, Erica gave away 29 cards. Now, let's see how many cards she has left:
\[ 50 - 29 = 21 \]

But wait! Erica also received 17 cards from her family and friends. So, we need to add those to the cards she has left:
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we have a big pizza with 12 slices. Jenny wants to share it with her friends, Bill and Mark.

1. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. 
   - 1/3 of 12 slices is 4 slices. So, Bill gets 4 slices.

2. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.
   - 1/4 of 12 slices is 3 slices. So, Mark gets 3 slices.

Now, let's see how many slices Bill and Mark have together:
- Bill has 4 slices.
- Mark has 3 slices.
- Together, they have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we add those 2 slices to the 7 slices that Bill and Mark have:
- Total slices eaten or given away: 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the 9 slices that are eaten or given away from the original 12 slices:
- 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

So, there are 3 slices left!

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in class.

Mark has $50 in his piggy bank. He gets $10 every day from his job. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. First, we need to find out how much more money Mark needs to buy the bike. 

So, we do:
$300 - $50 = $250

This means Mark needs $250 more to buy the bike. Now, since Mark gets $10 every day, we need to figure out how many days it will take for him to save $250. 

We do:
$250 ÷ $10 = 25

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders. That's a lot of spiders!
2. **Millipedes**: She saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, we need to find 1/3 of 90.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we need to find twice 30 and then subtract 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

2 glasses × 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Now, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find out how many calories John consumed, we multiply the total number of ounces by the number of calories per ounce:

16 ounces × 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to figure out how much flour and milk Mark needs for his big batch of brownies.**
   - The normal recipe needs 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
   - Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times as much of each.
   - So, for flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\).
   - And for milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark has to buy.**
   - Flour comes in 2-cup bags.
   - To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags.
   - Milk comes in 2-cup bottles.
   - To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles.

3. **Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. First, we need to know how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. It uses 900 watts every hour.

2. Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. So, the total energy used in one day is:
   \[
   900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts}
   \]

3. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will use it for:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The new total energy used in one day is:
   \[
   900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts}
   \]

5. The energy saved each day is the difference between the original usage and the new usage:
   \[
   7200 \text{ watts} - 2700 \text{ watts} = 4500 \text{ watts}
   \]

6. To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
   \[
   4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts}
   \]

7. Since 1000 watts is equal to 1 kilowatt, we convert the total savings to kilowatts:
   \[
   \frac{135000 \text{ watts}}{1000} = 135 \text{ kilowatts}

First, we need to count all the stripes on the zebras:
- There are two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, \(17 + 17 = 34\) stripes.
- There's one zebra with 36 stripes.
- There's another zebra with half as many stripes as the 36-striped zebra. Half of 36 is \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
- \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes in total.

Next, we need to find out how many zebras there are:
- There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes, 1 zebra with 36 stripes, and 1 zebra with 18 stripes. So, \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\) zebras.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:

   - Tyson is making sandwiches for 20 people.
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, we need 20 ÷ 4 = 5 sandwiches.

2. **How much meat and cheese do we need?**
   - Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

3. **How much does the meat and cheese cost?**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds of meat: 5 × $7.00 = $35.00
   - For 5 pounds of cheese: 5 × $3.00 = $15.00

4. **What is the total cost?**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese

So, let's see how many steps he took during his jog:

1. He started with 10,000 steps as his goal.
2. He already did 5,000 steps to and from school.
3. He did another 1,000 steps with his friend.
4. That means he did 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps before his jog.
5. He had 2,000 steps left after his jog, so he must have done 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before and during his jog.
6. Since he did 6,000 steps before his jog, the steps he took during his jog are 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

First, we need to figure out how much the company paid in May:
- There were 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- They worked for 4 weeks in May.
- Each hour, they got paid $15.

So, for one employee in May:
\[ 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 160 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ 160 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

For all 40 employees in May:

Next, we need to figure out how much the company paid in June:
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees stayed.
- 3/4 of 40 employees is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

For one employee in June:

4. Her sister picks three times as many apples from the short trees, so that's 45 apples.
5. Her sister doesn't pick any apples from the average trees.

Now, let's add up all the apples they picked together:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. Camels have 2 humps, and dromedaries have 1 hump. We know there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

1. **Count the Heads:**
   - Each camel and each dromedary has 1 head.
   - So, if we add up all the heads, we get 180. This means there are 180 animals in total.

2. **Count the Humps:**
   - Camels have 2 humps each.
   - Dromedaries have 1 hump each.
   - We know there are 304 humps in total.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many camels and dromedaries there are.

3. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let's say \( C \) is the number of camels.
   - Let's say \( D \) is the number of dromedaries.
   - We know:
     \[
     C + D = 180 \quad \text{(total number of animals)}
     \]
     \[
     2C + D = 304 \quad \text{(total number of humps)}
     \]

4. **Solve the Equations:**
   - From the first equation, we can say:
     \[
     D = 180 - C
     \]
   - Now, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
     \[
     2C + (180 - C) = 304
     \]
   - Simplify this:
     \[
     2C + 180 - C = 304
     \]
     \[
     C + 180 = 304
     \]
     \[
     C = 304 - 180
     \]
     \[
     C = 124
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Dromedaries:**
   - Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
     \[
     D = 180 - 124

     \[
     D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week trip in a simple way.

First, we look at the first 4 days:
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
- So, for 4 days, he traveled: 200 km/day × 4 days = 800 kilometers.

Next, for the following 2 days:
- He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
- 30% of 800 kilometers is: 0.30 × 800 km = 240 kilometers.

Then, on the next day:
- Tom didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.

Now, for the second week (7 days):
- Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
- So, for 7 days, he traveled: 300 km/day × 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 kilometers

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week trip.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we start with 50 cats on a rock. That's a lot of cats, right?

Then, four boats come and each boat takes 5 cats. So, we need to find out how many cats the boats took in total:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the 20 cats that the boats took from the 50 cats that were originally on the rock:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

So, 30 cats are left on the rock after the boats leave.

Next, 3 out of every 5 of these remaining cats run after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we do:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Now, we subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, Bill gets a special deal for the first 6 months. He pays $8 each month. So, for 6 months, he pays:
6 months × $8/month = $48

Next, the price goes up to $12 a month for the next 8 months. So, for these 8 months, he pays:
8 months × $12/month = $96

After that, the price goes up again to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and he has already paid for 14 months (6 + 8), he has 10 months left. For these 10 months, he pays:
10 months × $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the money he paid:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Find the price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - So, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

We have:
- 4 big buses, and each can carry 60 people.
- 6 smaller buses, and each can carry 30 people.
- 10 even smaller vans, and each can carry 15 people.

First, let's figure out how many people can fit in the big buses:
4 buses × 60 people per bus = 240 people

Next, let's see how many people can fit in the smaller buses:
6 buses × 30 people per bus = 180 people

Now, let's find out how many people can fit in the vans:
10 vans × 15 people per van = 150 people

Finally, we add all these numbers together to find out how many people can go on the trip:
240 people (big buses) + 180 people (smaller buses) + 150 people (vans) = 570 people

So, the total number of people that can join the day trip is 570."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Lillian wants to add some bird feeders to her garden. She builds 3 feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. That means she has 6 feeders in total.

Now, the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. So, for the 3 store-bought feeders:
- 3 feeders × 20 birds each = 60 birds

The feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. So, each homemade feeder attracts:
- 20 birds + 10 birds = 30 birds

For the 3 homemade feeders:
- 3 feeders × 30 birds each = 90 birds

Now, we add the birds from both types of feeders:
- 60 birds (from store-bought feeders) + 90 birds (from homemade feeders) = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day!

   - So, the soup costs \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is:
   - \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Kenny wants to go to an amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He also wants to have $50 left for spending money. So, he needs to make a total of $150 from selling his Pokemon cards.

Each card sells for $1.5. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. This means he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's say Kenny started with \( C \) cards. He sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of \( C \) cards, which is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

The money he makes from selling these cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150, so we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. The caterer was told to prepare hotdogs for 36 guests. He thought that half of these guests might want two hotdogs each. So, half of 36 is 18. That means 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.

2. For the 18 guests who want 2 hotdogs each, the caterer needs to prepare:
   - 18 guests × 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs

3. For the other 18 guests who want 1 hotdog each, the caterer needs to prepare:
   - 18 guests × 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs

4. So, in total, the caterer prepared:
   - 36 hotdogs + 18 hotdogs = 54 hotdogs

5. But then, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted 2 hotdogs each. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is:
   - 40 guests × 2 hotdogs = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs, but he needed 80 hotdogs. So, he was short by:
   - 80 hotdogs - 54 hotdogs = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who didn't get their second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs ÷ 1 hotdog per guest = 26 guests

So, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to add up all the things Charlotte wants to buy:
- The pots and pans cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these all together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

So, before any discounts, everything costs $165.00.

Next, the store is giving a 20% discount on everything. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

So, the discount is $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, after the discount, Charlotte's order costs $132.00.

Next, we need to see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mom gave her $16.

So, we add these together:
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs. We do this by subtracting the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:
$19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **How much money did George have left?**
   - George had $5 at first.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1 cent out of every 100 cents left.
   - 1% of $5 is \( 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \) dollars, or 5 cents.
   - So, George had 5 cents left.

2. **How much did George spend?**
   - If George had 5 cents left, he spent \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **How much did the chips cost?**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - So, the total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **How much did George spend on candy bars?**
   - George spent a total of $4.95.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - So, the amount he spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

5. **How many candy bars did George buy?**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: \( 3.75 \div 0.75 = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

   - The recipe needs 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that, so he uses 2 times 2 pounds, which is 4 pounds of onions.
   - Onions cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, 4 pounds of onions cost 4 times $2.00, which is $8.00.

2. **Beef Stock:**

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Billie's bedroom is a rectangle, and the area of the room is 360 square feet. The length of the room is 3 yards. But we need to change the length into feet because the area is in square feet. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, 3 yards is:

3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we know the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. So, we can write:

360 square feet = 9 feet × width

To find the width, we divide both sides by 9 feet:

Width = 360 square feet ÷ 9 feet = 40 feet

Now we know the width is 40 feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

So, we plug in the numbers:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 × 49 feet = 98 feet

So, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet.

So, we add these times together:
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Now, let's see how long it took James:
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. If Jon took 40 minutes, 10% of 40 is 4 minutes. So, James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.

We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes in total.

Now, we need to find out how long James took to run. We know the total time for James is 180 minutes, and we already know the time for the swim and the bike ride:
36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + run time = 180

So, we subtract the time for the swim and the bike ride from the total time:

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, the problem tells us that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, the problem says that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find out how long Movie A is, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

Next, we know that for every mile the horse runs, it eats half a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

16 miles × 0.5 bail of hay per mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3. So, the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:

8 bails × $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which means he has:

6 bills × $5 per bill = $30

After buying the hay, the change Michael will have is:

   - He bought 48 sneakers for $576.
   - So, the cost is $576.

2. **Next, we find out how much he made from selling some sneakers at the flash sale.**
   - He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
   - To find the total money from the flash sale, we multiply 17 by 20.
   - \( 17 \times 20 = 340 \)
   - So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many sneakers he had left after the flash sale.**
   - He started with 48 sneakers and sold 17.
   - To find the remaining sneakers, we subtract 17 from 48.
   - \( 48 - 17 = 31 \)
   - So, he had 31 sneakers left.

4. **Then, we find out how much he made from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store.**
   - He sold the 31 sneakers for $25 each.
   - To find the total money from the department store, we multiply 31 by 25.

First, we know that Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons. Out of these, six packets had eight crayons each, and the other four packets had sixteen crayons each.

To find out how many crayons are in the six packets with eight crayons each, we do:
6 packets × 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, for the four packets with sixteen crayons each, we do:
4 packets × 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, to find the total number of crayons, we add the two amounts together:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Super Ticket Cost:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for just $1 extra.
   - So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

2. **Regular Ticket Cost:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - We need to find out how much the popcorn costs. Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

3. **Total Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket is $12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + \( P \) (popcorn).
   - This can be written as $15 + \( P \).

4. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, $15 + \( P \) = $21 - $2.
   - This simplifies to $15 + \( P \) = $19.

5. **Finding the Cost of Popcorn:**
   - To find \( P \), we subtract $15 from both sides of the equation:
   - \( P \) = $19 - $15.
   - \( P \) = $4.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that 20 balloons cost $900. To find out how much one balloon costs, we divide $900 by 20:
\[ 900 \div 20 = 45 \]
So, one balloon costs $45.

Two days later, the price of each balloon went up by $20. So, the new price of one balloon is:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]
Now, one balloon costs $65.

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find out how much he will pay, we multiply the new price by 170:
\[ 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley will pay:
\[ 11050 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how far the car went in total. The car drove for 2 hours at 60 miles per hour. So, we do 60 times 2, which is 120 miles. Then, the car drove for 1 hour at 30 miles per hour. So, we do 30 times 1, which is 30 miles.

Now, we add the two distances together: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles. That's how far the car went in total!

Next, we need to know how long the car was driving. The car drove for 2 hours and then 1 more hour, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours in total.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. So, we do 150 miles ÷ 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 miles per hour.

50 mph"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800.
   - So, the total value of her sapphires is \(8 \times 800 = 6400\) dollars.

2. Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
   - The value of 3 sapphires is \(3 \times 800 = 2400\) dollars.
   - Each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

3. After the trade, Jenna has:
   - 5 sapphires left (because she traded 3 out of her 8).
   - 2 rubies.

4. Now, let's find out the total value of what Jenna has left:
   - The value of the 5 sapphires is \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.
   - The value of the 2 rubies is \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

5. Adding these together gives us the total value of all her jewels:
   - Total value = \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

So, the total value of all Jenna's jewels is 6400 dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Marin eats 4 apples every day. Nancy also eats 4 apples every day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples each day.

Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. If they eat 8 apples each day, then in 30 days, they will eat 8 apples/day × 30 days = 240 apples.

So, the answer is 240 apples."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much soil one raised bed needs. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, one raised bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil.

Bob has 10 raised beds, so we need to find out how much soil all the beds need together:

\[ 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 10 = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total cubic feet by the amount each bag holds:

\[ 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \div 2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:
1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cards**: We have 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: It says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we need to find out what 60% of 15 is:
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, we add 9 to 15 to get the number of green cards: \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the same as the total number of red and green cards together:
   - Red cards: 15
   - Green cards: 24
   - Total for yellow cards: \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards: \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. That's a lot of fairies, right?

Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did. Half of 50 is 25. So, 25 more fairies came from the east and joined the 50 fairies that were already there. Now, we add 50 and 25 together:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]
So, there were 75 fairies in total.

But then, 30 fairies flew away. We need to subtract 30 from 75 to find out how many fairies are left:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many puppies there are in total. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, we add these together:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]
There are 20 puppies in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, we add these together too:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]
There are 7 spotted puppies.

Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use a simple formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

First, we divide 7 by 20:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, 35% of the puppies have spots.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes.
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - So, the total weight of sugar cubes is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots.
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - So, the total weight of carrots is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - The farmer buys 42 bales of hay.
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - So, the total weight of hay is \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats.
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - So, the total weight of oats is \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

1. **Cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda each week.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, for the cans, she earns: 3 cans × 2 cents/can = 6 cents per week.

2. **Bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 bottles of water each week.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, for the bottles, she earns: 5 bottles × 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents per week.

3. **Total Earnings per Week:**
   - Now, we add the earnings from cans and bottles:
   - 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents per week.

4. **Total Earnings for a Four-Week Month:**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
   - 21 cents/week × 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. That's easy to remember!

Next, Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many more plants that is, we need to figure out what 60% of 10 is. 

60% of 10 is the same as 60 out of 100, which is 0.60. So, we multiply 10 by 0.60:
\[ 10 \times 0.60 = 6 \]

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. If Toni has 16 plants, then Shondra has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants!

- Becky bought 20 apples, and each apple costs 45 cents.
- So, 20 apples times 45 cents each is \(20 \times 45 = 900\) cents.
- Since 100 cents make a dollar, 900 cents is \(900 \div 100 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's see how much Kelly paid for her apples:
- Kelly also bought 20 apples, but each apple costs 50 cents.
- So, 20 apples times 50 cents each is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) cents.
- 1000 cents is \(1000 \div 100 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount, which means she saved 10% of 10 dollars.
- 10% of 10 dollars is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, Kelly paid \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many of each thing are in one room:
- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets times 2, which gives us 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 pillow cases times 2, which gives us 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the things in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, in one room, there are:
2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of laundry there are in 80 rooms. We do this by multiplying the number of pieces in one room by 80:

4. **On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes.** That's 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. **Now, let's add all the shoes he got during the week:**
   - 200 (initial) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.
6. **On Saturday, Frank gets rid of 180 shoes.** So, we subtract 180 from 300:

Benny saw a big shark that was 10 feet long. That's really big! Now, there were two little fish called remoras stuck to the shark. Each remora was 6 inches long. 

First, we need to figure out how long the remoras are together. Since there are two remoras and each is 6 inches, we add them up:
6 inches + 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, we need to change the inches to feet because the shark's length is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
12 inches = 1 foot

So, the two remoras together are 1 foot long.

Next, we need to find out what part of the shark's length the remoras take up. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long. We can think of this as a fraction:
1 foot (remoras) / 10 feet (shark) = 1/10

To turn this fraction into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
1/10 * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

But wait! The 3 kids who are allergic to both are counted twice in this number. So, we need to take those 3 kids out once to get the right count:
15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the 12 kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:

\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
So, the hotel costs $300 more per day. Adding this to the normal price, we get:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
Since they are staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 

Jasper has half as many blue tubes as Ben. So, if Ben has 4 blue tubes, Jasper has:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \] blue tubes.

Jasper also has three times as many yellow tubes as Ben. So, if Ben has 3 yellow tubes, Jasper has:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \] yellow tubes.

Now, let's add up all the tubes Jasper has:
\[ 2 \text{ blue tubes} + 9 \text{ yellow tubes} = 11 \text{ tubes} \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we know that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is a bit lighter; it's only three-quarters as heavy as the 1959 penny. 

To find out how much the 2010 penny weighs, we need to take three-quarters of 48 grains. 

Three-quarters means we take 3 out of 4 parts. So, we can do this by dividing 48 by 4 and then multiplying by 3:

\[ 48 \div 4 = 12 \]
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the total weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny together:

\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Keegan and Tashay are trying to make $200 for their baseball camp. By 3 pm, Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91. 

First, we need to add how much money they made together:
$83 + $91 = $174

Now, we need to find out how much more they need to make to get to $200. We do this by subtracting the amount they have from their goal:
$200 - $174 = $26

So, Keegan and Tashay need to make $26 more to reach their goal.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, we need to multiply 20 by 3 to find out how many songs Luri has:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, both Gabriel and Luri's players can hold up to 100 songs. We need to figure out how many more songs each can add.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs.

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
So, Luri can add 40 more songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel.

   - First, divide 60 by 5: \( 60 \div 5 = 12 \)
   - Then, multiply 12 by 2: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)
   So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

2. Now, we need to figure out how much money Stetson gave up. He gives up $10 for each orange he eats. So, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by 10:
   - \( 24 \times 10 = 240 \)

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

1. **First, figure out how much oats one horse eats in a day:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - They eat 2 meals a day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds × 2 meals = 10 pounds of oats per day.

2. **Next, figure out how much oats all four horses eat in a day:**
   - If one horse eats 10 pounds a day, then four horses eat 10 pounds × 4 horses = 40 pounds of oats per day.

3. **Now, figure out how much oats all four horses eat in five days:**
   - If the horses eat 40 pounds a day, then in five days they eat 40 pounds × 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.

4. **Finally, figure out how many bags of oats are needed:**
   - Each bag has 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag: 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians she has, we need to do a bit of math:

1. First, we find out what one third of 27 is. We do this by dividing 27 by 3:
   \[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]
2. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we multiply 9 by 2:
   \[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we do another bit of math:

1. We find out what one third of 18 is by dividing 18 by 3:
   \[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

- Midlandia: -3°F

So, we add them up:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we need to find the average. To do that, we divide the total by the number of places, which is 3:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these three places is -10°F.

First, we need to know how many eggs can fit on the trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, we do the math:

24 eggs/tray × 2 trays = 48 eggs

This means Jaime can put 48 eggs on the trays.

Now, Jaime has 64 eggs in total. We need to find out how many eggs are left over after he fills the trays. We do this by subtracting the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

1. **First, let's figure out how much Heather pays for the razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The store has a special offer: buy one pack, get one pack free.
   - So, if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - That means she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

2. **Now, let's use the coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - So, she subtracts $2.00 from the $4.00 she would have paid.
   - $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00
   - Heather pays $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.

3. **Next, let's find out how many razors she gets:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors.
   - She bought 2 packs, so she gets:
   - 2 packs × 4 razors per pack = 8 razors

4. **Finally, let's find out how much each razor costs:**
   - Heather paid $2.00 for 8 razors.
   - To find the cost of one razor, we divide $2.00 by 8:
   - $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25
   - $0.25 is the same as 25 cents.

So, each individual razor costs **25 cents**."

First, we need to figure out how tall the human pyramid will be. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, will be at the very top.

Now, let's break down the pyramid:

1. **Bottom layer**: 4 girls, each 64 inches tall.
   - 4 girls × 64 inches = 256 inches

2. **Second layer**: 3 girls, each 64 inches tall.
   - 3 girls × 64 inches = 192 inches

3. **Third layer**: 2 girls, each 64 inches tall.
   - 2 girls × 64 inches = 128 inches

4. **Top layer**: 1 girl, who is 60 inches tall.
   - 1 girl × 60 inches = 60 inches

Now, we add all these heights together to get the total height of the pyramid:
- 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

To find out how tall the pyramid is in feet, we need to divide the total inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- 636 inches ÷ 12 = 53 feet

So, the human pyramid is 53 feet tall.

Paul drives his car twice every day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days.

1. In the morning, each ride costs $6.
2. In the afternoon, each ride costs $2.

First, let's find out how much he spends on morning rides:
- He drives in the morning for 14 days.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- So, the total cost for morning rides is 14 days * $6 = $84.

Next, let's find out how much he spends on afternoon rides:
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- So, the total cost for afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 = $28.

Now, let's add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount he spent:
- Total cost = $84 (morning) + $28 (afternoon) = $112.

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley brought:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, we add the oranges that Ashley and Brianne brought together to find the total number of oranges:

50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges

To make one Greek orange pie, we need 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:

"Okay, let's think about this like a fun game! We have two places where we can have a party for Mark's wife. We need to figure out how many friends can come to the party so that both places cost the same.

**First Place:**
- It costs $200 no matter how many friends come.
- But we also need to buy food, and that costs $5 for each friend.

**Second Place:**
- It costs $25 for each friend, and the food is already included.

We want to find out how many friends (let's call this number \( x \)) need to come so that both places cost the same.

For the first place, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second place, the total cost is:
\[ 25x \]

We want these two costs to be the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
1. First, we move the \( 5x \) from the left side to the right side:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
2. This simplifies to:
\[ 200 = 20x \]
3. Now, we divide both sides by 20 to find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
4. So:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, if 10 friends come to the party, both places will cost the same!

First, we know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects. That's a lot of bugs!

We also know that:
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many insects each of them found.

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. Since David found half as many insects as Bodhi, Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we can write an equation to show the total number of insects they found together:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Let's add up all the \( D \)'s:
\[ D + D + 7 + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects.

Now, let's find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 \]
\[ L = 9 + 7 \]
\[ L = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. We need to find out how much yarn they used together.

First, let's add the fractions:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.
- Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein.

To add these, we need to make the bottom numbers (denominators) the same. The smallest number that both 4 and 2 can go into is 4. So, we change 1/2 to 2/4.

Now we add:
1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

So, together they used 3/4 of a skein.

Next, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. We know that a full skein has 364 yards.

To find 3/4 of 364, we can do this:
3/4 × 364 = (3 × 364) ÷ 4

First, multiply 3 by 364:
3 × 364 = 1092

Then, divide 1092 by 4:
1092 ÷ 4 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

Let's add up what we know:
- Grape pack: $2
- Green apple pack: $1
- Total cost: $7

So, the cost of the strawberry packs together is:
\[ 7 - (2 + 1) = 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry packs by 2:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

4. **How many 2 x 4 pieces can Frederick buy with $24?**
   - If each 2 x 4 piece costs $4, then with $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **How many popsicle sticks can he get from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood?**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.

60 milliliters per kilometer × 2 kilometers = 120 milliliters

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent, we need to calculate 20% of $500. 

20% of $500 is:
\[ 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying clothes:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400.

25% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying CDs:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Imagine you have a big piggy bank with $120,000. This money is for buying a house and a piece of land. The house costs three times as much as the land.

Let's say the land costs $30,000. If the house costs three times as much, then the house would cost:
\[ 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the land and the house to see if it matches our piggy bank:
\[ 30,000 + 90,000 = 120,000 \]

It matches! So, the house costs $90,000.

The cost of the house is:
\[ 90,000 \]"

1. First, we need to find out how many canvas bags Tara bought. She bought 8 packs, and each pack has 5 bags. So, we do:
   \[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much she spent on these bags. Each pack costs $4, and she bought 8 packs. So, we do:
   \[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much money she made by selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, and she had 40 bags. So, we do:
   \[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Finally, to find out her profit, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she made. So, we do:

Next, we know that each round in the fight lasts for 3 minutes. So, in one round, Joe throws:
25 punches per minute × 3 minutes = 75 punches

Now, the fight has 5 rounds. So, in the whole fight, Joe throws:
75 punches per round × 5 rounds = 375 punches

So, Joe throws 375 punches in the whole fight.

So, Josh made 9 cookies.

Now, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we need to find out what two times 9 is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, we add them up:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of his money to his sister. Half of 160 dollars is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner. To find out how much he spends, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to change this to minutes because the question asks for the answer in minutes. 

1 hour is 60 minutes, so:
2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

Next, the problem says that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to find out what double Rob's time is:
Double of 120 minutes = 120 × 2 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the extra 40 minutes that Royce takes:
240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house."

Martha is making winter clothes for her 3 grandchildren. Each grandchild will get a hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of socks. We need to figure out how many pieces of wool (we call them skeins) she needs to buy.

First, let's see how many skeins are needed for one grandchild:
- A hat needs 2 skeins.
- A scarf needs 4 skeins.
- A sweater needs 12 skeins.
- A pair of mittens needs 1 skein.
- A pair of socks needs 2 skeins.

Now, let's add these up for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the number of skeins for one grandchild by 3:
21 skeins/child × 3 children = 63 skeins

So, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool.

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts of strawberries every hour. That's like picking 6 big baskets of strawberries in one hour!

2. **Bobby** picks one less quart than Tony. So, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts every hour. That's 5 big baskets for Bobby!

3. **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts as Bobby. So, Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts every hour. That's 10 big baskets for Kathy!

4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts than Kathy. So, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts every hour. That's 8 big baskets for Ricky!

Now, let's add up all the quarts they can pick together in one hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

   - So, 200 - 93 = 107 loaves left.
3. Next, we take away the loaves they sold in the afternoon. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
   - So, 107 - 39 = 68 loaves left.

So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, we need to figure out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant. He has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. So, we divide 24 by 8:
\[ 24 \div 8 = 3 \]
So, Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

   So, each thing (cookies, granola, and snack mix) gets 9 cups of raisins.

4. Now, we need to figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins.
5. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much Ada spends on electricity each day right now. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50. So, we multiply 12 by 1.50:

\[ 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \]

So, Ada spends $18 each day on electricity.

Next, we need to find out how much more the new device will cost her each day. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour still costs $1.50. So, we multiply 2 by 1.50:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]

So, the new device will cost her $3 each day.

Now, we add the cost of the new device to her current daily cost to find out how much she will spend each day after adding the device:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, after adding the device, Ada will spend $21 each day on electricity.

To find out how much more she will spend each week, we need to calculate her weekly costs before and after adding the device. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily costs by 7:

Before adding the device:
\[ 18 \times 7 = 126 \]

After adding the device:
\[ 21 \times 7 = 147 \]

- Total money Tom spent: $48
- Cost of the CD: $4
- Cost of the headphone set: $48 - $4 = $44

Now, we know the headphone set cost $44. If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to spend on CDs.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $44:
- Cost of one CD: $4

Josh worked out for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he worked out for 4 hours each week. But there were some weeks when he worked out more:

- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's count how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- He worked out for 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
- He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
- So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:
- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   - 5 × 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
4. Now, we add these 40 people to the 40 people already on the bus:
   - 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, the dinner bill is $50. Your wife wants you to pay an extra 20% for a tip. 

To find 20% of $50, you can do this:
20% of $50 is the same as 20 out of 100 parts of $50. So, you can calculate it like this:
20 ÷ 100 = 0.20
0.20 × $50 = $10

So, the tip is $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill:
$50 + $10 = $60

The total bill is $60. Since you and your wife are splitting the bill, each of you would normally pay half of $50, which is:
$50 ÷ 2 = $25

But you have to pay the whole tip of $10. So, you need to add the tip to your half of the bill:
$25 + $10 = $35

   - The first half has 15 days.
   - The second half also has 15 days.

3. **Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.**
   - Let's say he saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
   - So, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars in total.
   - In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.
   - So, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars in total.

4. **Elvis's total savings for the month should be $1125.**
   - So, the total savings from both halves of the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).
   - We know that \( 45x = 1125 \).

5. **Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is.**
   - We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
     \[
     x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

6. **So, \( x \) is 25.**
   - This means Elvis saves 25 dollars each day in the first half.
   - In the second half, he saves \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars each day.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

   - So, 3 apples * $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges.
   - Each orange costs $0.80.
   - So, 5 oranges * $0.80 = $4.00.

3. **Peaches:**
   - Verna bought 6 peaches.
   - Each peach costs $0.75.
   - So, 6 peaches * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Verna spent:
- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00.

Verna gave the store $20.00. To find out how much change she got back, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

\[ 16 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus gets 6 dollars more than Jenny.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Jeff and Brad are sharing 100 dollars. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

First, let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

Together, they have:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This is the same as:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. 

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

80"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that Jeff's work is 3 miles away. So, when he goes to work, he walks 3 miles. When he comes back home, he walks another 3 miles. That means in one day, he walks:

3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles

Now, Jeff works 5 days a week. So, we need to find out how many miles he walks in 5 days. We do this by multiplying the miles he walks in one day by the number of days he works:

6 miles/day × 5 days = 30 miles

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, Elise writes the whole alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so:
   - 26 letters × 2 = 52 letters

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   - 13 letters

3. Now, she writes everything she has already written again. She has already written 52 letters plus 13 letters, which is:
   - 52 + 13 = 65 letters

4. So, she writes all 65 letters again:
   - 65 letters

Now, let's add up all the letters she has written:
- 52 letters (first two full alphabets) + 13 letters (half alphabet) + 65 letters (rewriting everything) = 130 letters

So, Elise has written **130 letters** in total."

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of those 3 families calls 3 more families. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of those 9 families calls 3 more families. So, \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of those 27 families calls 3 more families. So, \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

So, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, we need to figure out how much weight he lost in total.

1. First, we multiply the number of months by the weight he lost each month:
   3 months * 10 pounds/month = 30 pounds

2. Now, we know he lost 30 pounds in total. His final weight was 70 pounds. To find out how much he weighed before he got sick, we add the weight he lost to his final weight:
   70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

   80 \times 5 = 400
   \]
   Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a play set five times bigger than James's.

3. Jonathan is 2 toys short of having 400 toys. So, if he had 2 more toys, he would have 400 toys. This means he currently has:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend on his school stuff.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each. So, \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each. So, \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12.00 each. So, \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\).
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each. So, \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\).

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on everything. To find the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

So, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Daniel has to spend:

First, we need to find out how much Carly spent on each type of food and drink.

1. **Hamburgers:**
   - Carly bought 5 hamburgers.
   - Each hamburger costs $4.
   - So, 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20.

2. **Potato Fries:**
   - Carly bought 10 packs of potato fries.
   - Each pack costs $0.30.
   - So, 10 packs * $0.30 each = $3.

3. **Fruit Drinks:**
   - Carly bought 5 cans of fruit drinks.
   - Each can costs $2.
   - So, 5 cans * $2 each = $10.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Carly spent:
- Total cost = $20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $33.

Carly gave the cashier a fifty-dollar bill. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from $50:
- Change = $50 - $33 = $17.

So, Carly gets back $17 in change.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Imagine Antonella is selling toys. She gets a special treat for selling toys worth $1000, and an extra treat for selling more than that.

1. For the first $1000 worth of toys, she gets 30% of that as a treat. So, we need to find 30% of $1000.
   - 30% of $1000 is like saying 30 out of 100 parts of $1000.
   - 30 out of 100 parts of $1000 is $300.

2. For the extra $1500 worth of toys (because she sold $2500 in total and $2500 - $1000 = $1500), she gets 10% as a treat. So, we need to find 10% of $1500.
   - 10% of $1500 is like saying 10 out of 100 parts of $1500.
   - 10 out of 100 parts of $1500 is $150.

3. Now, we add the two treats together to find out how much Antonella earned in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, Bill has 2 cases of water. Each case has 24 bottles. So, we need to find out how many bottles that is in total:
\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, Bill has 70 guests, and he wants each guest to have 2 bottles of water. So, we need to find out how many bottles that is in total:
\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we know Bill already has 48 bottles, but he needs 140 bottles in total. To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. That's pretty fast!

Now, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, we need to figure out what ""twice as long"" means and then add 2 minutes.

Twice 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to 32 minutes:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, when the water is warm, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water. We do this by subtracting the time for cold water from the time for warm water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money John makes in one week. He works 5 hours each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 5 hours by 4 days:
5 hours/day × 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we know John gets paid $2 for each hour he works. So, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his pay rate:
20 hours/week × $2/hour = $40/week

Now, John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by the amount he saves each week:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Now, let's count the holes:

- For the 7 buttons with 2 holes each: 7 buttons × 2 holes = 14 holes
- For the 14 buttons with 4 holes each: 14 buttons × 4 holes = 56 holes

Finally, we add the holes together:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70."

24 ÷ 2 = 12
So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.

Next, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. To find 1/4 of 12, we divide 12 by 4:

First, we know that Mark weighs 150 pounds. That's a lot, right?

Now, Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we need to take away 20 pounds from Mark's weight to find Susan's weight:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]
So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. To find Bob's weight, we need to multiply Susan's weight by 2:
\[ 130 \times 2 = 260 \]
So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. To do this, we add up all their weights and then divide by 3 (because there are 3 friends).

First, let's add up their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Now, we divide the total weight by 3:

\[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to know how many pages she can read in those 105 minutes. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pages she reads per minute by the total minutes she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages. So, we add the pages from the first week to the pages from the second week:

First, we need to find out how big his bedroom is. The room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide. To find the area, we multiply these two numbers:
\[ 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's break down the costs:

1. **New Carpet:**
   The new carpet costs $12 per square foot. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 12 = 2,592 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Padding:**
   The padding costs $2 per square foot. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 2 = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Removing Old Carpet:**
   The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 4 = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Installing New Carpet:**
   The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. So, for 216 square feet:
   \[ 216 \times 34 = 7,344 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total:
\[ 2,592 + 432 + 864 + 7,344 = 11,232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ 11,232 \]"
"Okay, let's count the birds Mack saw each day and find out the average.

- On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds in total.
- On day three, he saw 0 birds.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds in total.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

First, we add up all the birds:
50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds

Next, we count the number of days:
There are 7 days in a week.

Now, we find the average by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds ÷ 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds each day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math puzzle!

1. Diane starts with the number 20.
2. She adds half of 20 to it. Half of 20 is 10, so 20 + 10 = 30.
3. Then, she divides 30 by 5. That gives us 6.
4. Next, she takes the starting number, 20, and subtracts 12 from it. So, 20 - 12 = 8.
5. Finally, she multiplies the 6 by the 8. So, 6 x 8 = 48.

So, the final number in the train is 48."
"Okay, let's think about this. The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does. So, if we take away 3 cards from the boy's 5 cards, his brother has 2 cards. Now, if we add the boy's cards and his brother's cards together, we get:

5 cards + 2 cards = 7 cards

So, together they have 7 cards."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Maggie's oven is a bit tricky. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's a bit too hot. We need to figure out how much too hot it is, and then use that to find out what temperature she should set it to if she wants it to be 520 degrees.

First, let's see how much too hot it is when she sets it to 450 degrees:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees.
- It actually gets to 468 degrees.
- So, it's 468 - 450 = 18 degrees too hot.

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 degrees is of 450 degrees:
- 18 out of 450 is the same as 18 ÷ 450 = 0.04.
- To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.04 × 100 = 4%.

So, the oven is 4% too hot.

Now, we want the oven to be 520 degrees. We need to find out what temperature Maggie should set it to so that it ends up being 520 degrees, even though it's 4% too hot.

Let's call the temperature she should set it to ""x."" If the oven is 4% too hot, then:
- The actual temperature will be x + 4% of x.
- 4% of x is 0.04 × x.
- So, the actual temperature will be x + 0.04x = 1.04x.

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
- 1.04x = 520.

To find x, we divide both sides by 1.04:
- x = 520 ÷ 1.04 = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to 520 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long each movie is in minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we add 60 minutes and 30 minutes:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, we add 120 minutes and 5 minutes:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the minutes of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Herb's house costs $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. To find out how much less, we need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's house. Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find out how much Juan's house costs:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we need to find the total value of both houses together. We add the cost of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, Judy bought 12 cups. That's a dozen, which is 12. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, if she has 12 cups, she must have:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, her friend brought 40 cups. That's a lot more than Judy! Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy. So, if Judy has 24 dishes, her friend must have:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes that Judy and her friend brought:

Judy's total:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils} \]

Her friend's total:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is:
\[ 36 + 84 = 120 \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100, but there's a 10% discount. 

10% of $100 is $10. So, each box costs $100 - $10 = $90.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90 + $90 = $180.

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets. Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 90 + 90 = 180 contacts.

Since Pete uses 2 contacts each day, the number of pairs of contacts is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

Finally, to find out how much each pair of contacts costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

$180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair.

So, each pair of contacts costs $2.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how many hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 2 hours, John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 1 hour, John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them earned:
- Jill earns $10 per hour, so for 3 hours, she earned 3 * $10 = $30.
- John earns $10 per hour, so for 7 hours, he earned 7 * $10 = $70.

Finally, we need to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John earned $70, and Jill earned $30.
- The difference is $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour she burns 500 calories. So, for 2 hours, she burns:
500 calories/hour × 2 hours = 1000 calories

Next, she runs for 1 hour, and during that time, she burns 600 calories. So, for running, she burns:
600 calories/hour × 1 hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from aerobics and running to find the total:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories. We can do this by dividing the total calories by 200 and then multiplying by 100 ml:
(1600 calories ÷ 200) × 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

We have a big jar with three colors of jelly beans: red, blue, and green. The note on the jar tells us:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

First, let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99 \times B \]

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01 \times B \]

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Let's add these together:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know:
- The number of blue jelly beans is 1500.
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

3. If he improves again by 5 more words, his new speed will be:
   \[
   52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM}

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds. To do that, we add all the speeds together and then divide by 3 (since there are three speeds).

So, let's add them up:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Next, we divide the total by 3:
\[
156 \div 3 = 52

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would lose:
1.25 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would gain:
1.75 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find out the difference in his weight between the two options, we add the weight he would lose to the weight he would gain:
6.25 pounds + 8.75 pounds = 15 pounds

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 15 pounds.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, if we think about it, 5 years ago, Jerry was half his current age.

Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was \( x \). That means his current age is \( 2x \).

Now, if we add 5 years to \( x \), we get his current age:
\[ x + 5 = 2x \]

To find \( x \), we can solve this equation:
\[ x + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 5 = 2x - x \]
\[ 5 = x \]

So, 5 years ago, Jerry was 5 years old. That means his current age is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years. If he is 10 years old now, in 3 years he will be:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We know that in a triangle, all the angles add up to 180 degrees. That's a rule we learned in school!

Now, we have three angles, and we know:
- One angle is the smallest.
- Another angle is twice the smallest.
- The last angle is three times the smallest.

Let's call the smallest angle ""x"" degrees. Then:
- The second angle is 2 times x, so it's 2x degrees.
- The third angle is 3 times x, so it's 3x degrees.

Now, we add all these angles together:
x + 2x + 3x = 180 degrees

This is the same as:
6x = 180 degrees

To find out what x is, we divide both sides by 6:
x = 180 ÷ 6
x = 30 degrees

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, let's find the other angles:
- The second angle is 2 times 30, which is 60 degrees.
- The third angle is 3 times 30, which is 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. First, we need to know how much money he has in total.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth 8 × 25 = 200 cents.
- He also has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth 6 × 10 = 60 cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth 14 × 5 = 70 cents.
- Lastly, he has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth 15 × 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money together:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

- Tuesday: $16
- Wednesday: $64

Total spent: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

Howard originally had $100. So, the money he has left is:
- $100 - $88 = $12

So, Howard has $12 left.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade.

First, for the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup cost 50 cents, which is the same as $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he made 15 cups × $0.50 = $7.50.
- For four hours, he made 4 hours × $7.50 = $30.

Next, for the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup cost 60 cents, which is the same as $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he made 10 cups × $0.60 = $6.
- For two hours, he made 2 hours × $6 = $12.

Now, we add the money he made in the first four hours and the next two hours:
- Total money made = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, Patrick made $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many times the tires turn when Jeremy drives 400 miles in a month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires turn 725 times. So, for 400 miles, we do:

400 miles ÷ 2 miles = 200
200 × 725 = 145,000 turns in one month.

Now, let's see how many turns the tires make in one year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

145,000 turns/month × 12 months/year = 1,740,000 turns in one year.

The tires can handle 10,440,000 turns before they need to be replaced. To find out how many years that will take, we divide the total number of turns the tires can handle by the number of turns they make in one year:

10,440,000 turns ÷ 1,740,000 turns/year = 6 years.

So, Jeremy's tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The big bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. The instructions say to use 2 pumps for each wash, and this gives you 120 washes. But Jackie only uses 1 pump for each wash.

First, we need to figure out how many washes Jackie can get with 1 pump. If 2 pumps give 120 washes, then 1 pump will give twice as many washes, because Jackie is using half the amount of shampoo per wash. So, 120 washes times 2 equals 240 washes.

Now, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The bottle costs $24.00, and it gives 240 washes. To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

$24.00 ÷ 240 = $0.10

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

$0.10 × 100 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the shirt and shorts cost together. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, we add them up:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Now, there's a 30% off sale, which means Joe gets a discount. To find out how much he saves, we need to calculate 30% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.30 = 18 \]

So, Joe saves $18. To find out how much he actually pays, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 60 - 18 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the shirt and shorts, he will have:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants. If 1 dozen croissants need 1/4 pound of butter, then 4 dozen croissants will need:
   - 4 times 1/4 pound of butter.
   - 4 times 1/4 is 1 pound of butter.

2. Now, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a whole week. A week has 7 days, so:
   - He will need 1 pound of butter each day.
   - For 7 days, he will need 7 times 1 pound of butter.
   - 7 times 1 is 7 pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

First, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 for each meter. So, we multiply 150 by 194:
\[ 150 \times 194 = 29100 \]
So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 for each meter. So, we multiply 490 by 194:
\[ 490 \times 194 = 95060 \]
So, it costs $95,060 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:
\[ 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First 5 months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - So, each month, he gets $100,000 ÷ 5 = $20,000.

2. **Total research time:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months.
   - So, the total time is 5 months × 10 = 50 months.

3. **Additional months:**
   - After the first 5 months, there are 50 months - 5 months = 45 more months.
   - For these extra months, each month costs 50% more than the first 5 months.
   - 50% more than $20,000 is $20,000 × 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

4. **Cost for the additional 45 months:**
   - For 45 months, the cost is $30,000 × 45 = $1,350,000.

5. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the cost for the first 5 months plus the cost for the additional 45 months.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. That's 6 ounces of meat.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each beef tip is 1 ounce. So, 8 beef tips times 1 ounce each equals 8 ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. We need to remember that 1 pound is the same as 16 ounces. So, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players didn't eat any meat because they ordered vegetarian meals.

Now, let's add up all the meat:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

So, the team ate a total of 30 ounces of meat.

1000 people × 3 posts/person = 3000 posts in one day.

Now, March has 31 days. To find out how many posts are made in the whole month, we multiply the number of posts made in one day by the number of days in March:

3000 posts/day × 31 days = 93000 posts.

So, the group will have 93000 posts in March.

So, Gary does 104 loads of laundry in a year.

Next, we need to find out how much water he uses. Each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, for 104 loads:
\[ 104 \times 20 = 2080 \]
Gary uses 2080 gallons of water in a year.

Now, we need to find out how much this water costs. Water costs $0.15 per gallon. So, for 2080 gallons:
\[ 2080 \times 0.15 = 312 \]
So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"Okay, let's add up all the things Scarlett bought:

- The aquarium cost her $10.00.
- She bought 2 bags of rocks, each for $2.50, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
- She got 3 pieces of coral, each for $2.00, so that's 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- She bought 20 fish, each for $0.50, so that's 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
- She also bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

First, Jane's beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. That's about as tall as a small toy car!

Then, in the second week, it doubled in height. So, we need to multiply the height by 2. That means 3 inches times 2 equals 6 inches. Now the beanstalk is as tall as a pencil!

In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. So, we add 4 inches to the 6 inches it was already. That's 6 inches plus 4 inches, which equals 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall. That's about as tall as a big ruler!

Prince is a butcher, and he sells 15 kilograms of meat every hour. He works for 10 hours each day. So, to find out how much meat he sells in one day, we do this:

15 kilograms/hour × 10 hours/day = 150 kilograms/day

Now, his friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750 kilograms. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

750 kilograms ÷ 150 kilograms/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

Next, we know that one-fourth of these seats were taken by the administrators. To find out how many seats that is, we divide 72 by 4:
\[ 72 \div 4 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, one-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. To find out how many seats that is, we divide 54 by 3:

10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Next, we need to figure out how much the company spent to get these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car to get them. So, for each car, the company paid:
30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total amount the company spent to get all the cars is:
10 * $7,500 = $75,000

Now, we need to find out how much profit the company made. The profit is the total money from selling the cars minus the total money spent to get the cars:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on this profit. So, we calculate 10% of $175,000:

   The price of the gold Jewell is 4/5 of the price of the diamond Jewell. So, we need to find 4/5 of $2000.
   \[
   \text{Price of the Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
   So, the gold Jewell costs $1600.

3. **Price of the Silver Jewell:**
   The price of the silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of the gold Jewell. So, we subtract $400 from $1600.

Manny signed up for Karate classes, and it costs $60 for 10 classes. His parents said if each class costs more than $10, they won't sign him up again.

First, let's figure out how much each class costs if Manny goes to all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will go up. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he will go to \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class will be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (as long as \( 10 - x \) is not zero):
\[ 60 \leq 10 \times (10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Now, let's move the 100 to the other side:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

To get rid of the negative sign, we can divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]

So, \( x \) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know that Jewel can help 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many customers Jewel helps in a week by multiplying 50 by 7:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
So, Jewel helps 350 customers in a week.

Now, Julie is twice as fast as Jewel. This means Julie can help twice as many customers as Jewel in the same amount of time. So, if Jewel helps 50 customers a day, Julie helps:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]
So, Julie helps 100 customers each day.

To find out how many customers Julie helps in a week, we multiply 100 by 7:
\[ 100 \times 7 = 700 \]
So, Julie helps 700 customers in a week.

To find the total number of customers both Julie and Jewel help in a week, we add the number of customers each helps:
\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

So, the total number of customers helped by Julie and Jewel in a week is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn.
   - If Reggie ran 20 miles, then Lynn ran 3 miles less than Reggie.
   - So, Lynn ran \( 20 - 3 = 17 \) miles.

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to find the cost of one apple:
\[ 5.20 \div 4 = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to find the cost of one orange:
\[ 3.30 \div 3 = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples cost. We multiply the cost of one apple by 5:
\[ 1.30 \times 5 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

Then, we need to find out how much 5 oranges cost. We multiply the cost of one orange by 5:
\[ 1.10 \times 5 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

12.00"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much dirt Bob needs to move. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the total amount of dirt, we multiply these numbers together:

6 feet (length) × 4 feet (width) × 3 feet (depth) = 72 cubic feet

So, Bob needs to move 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of dirt. To find out how long it will take him to shovel all 72 cubic feet, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel each one:

72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

216"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill's new truck will cost. We need to add up all the parts:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Exterior light package: $1,500

Total cost: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

1. **Tim's old salary:**
   - Tim used to make $20,000 every month.

2. **Tim's raise:**
   - He got a 5% raise. To find out how much that is, we need to multiply $20,000 by 5% (which is the same as 0.05).
   - So, $20,000 × 0.05 = $1,000.

3. **Tim's new monthly salary:**
   - Now, we add the raise to his old salary.
   - $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

4. **Tim's bonus:**
   - The bonus is half of his new monthly salary.
   - So, $21,000 ÷ 2 = $10,500.

5. **Tim's total earnings in a year:**
   - First, we calculate how much he makes in a year from his new monthly salary.
   - $21,000 × 12 months = $252,000.
   - Then, we add the bonus to this amount.
   - $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much James spent on the suits. He bought 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, we do:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]
So, the suits cost $7500.

Next, let's look at the dress pants. James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, and each pair costs 1/5 of what a suit costs. Since a suit costs $750, we do:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
So, each pair of dress pants costs $150. Now, for 10 pairs:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]
So, the dress pants cost $1500.

Now, for the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he bought 10 suits, he gets:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
So, he buys 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]
So, the dress shirts cost $1800.

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is $10800.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we can find the total by multiplying 20 by 28:
\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \]
So, the news website publishes 560 articles in February.

Next, we need to find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we can find the total by multiplying 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \]
So, the sister company publishes 280 articles in February.

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites together, we add the two totals:
\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:

2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 ÷ 2 = 32 years old.
4. The son's wife is 3 years younger than the son, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

Next, we need to find out how far Stanley biked. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
- 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance they both biked:
- 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet every hour. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, we divide 24 feet by 4 feet per hour:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet every hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay. So, we divide 8 feet by 2 feet per hour:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

- Howie: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His classmates: 25

So, the total number of people is:
1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people

Now, each of these 27 people will get 2 cupcakes. So, we need to multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets:
27 people × 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, let's figure out how much Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates.
- Each pomegranate cost $20.
- So, the total cost before the voucher is \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
- Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off.
- So, the total cost after the voucher is \( 400 - 2 = 398 \) dollars.

Next, let's figure out how much Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday:
- Sheila also bought 20 pomegranates.
- Each pomegranate now costs $30.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- 10% of 600 is \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \( 600 - 60 = 540 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the difference between what Clara paid and what Sheila paid:
- Clara paid 398 dollars.
- Sheila paid 540 dollars.
- The difference is \( 540 - 398 = 142 \) dollars.

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats.**
   - We know she made $400 from red hats.
   - The problem says that the red hats' sales were half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, if $400 is half, then the full amount from green hats must be $400 times 2.
   - That means she made $800 from green hats.

2. **Next, we add the sales from red and green hats to find the total for the first month.**
   - Red hats: $400
   - Green hats: $800
   - Total for the first month: $400 + $800 = $1200

3. **Now, we need to figure out how much she made in the second month.**
   - The problem says that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of what she made in the first month.
   - So, we take 3/4 of $1200.
   - To find 3/4 of $1200, we can first find 1/4 of $1200, which is $1200 ÷ 4 = $300.
   - Then, we multiply $300 by 3 to get 3/4: $300 × 3 = $900.
   - So, she made $900 in the second month.

4. **Finally, we add the sales from both months to get the total.**
   - First month: $1200
   - Second month: $900
   - Total for both months: $1200 + $900 = $2100

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100."

First, we need to know how much the plane costs. The plane costs $150,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much James pays each month to keep the plane in a hanger. He pays $5,000 every month for the hanger.

Then, we need to find out how much he spends on fuel each month. He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger. So, he spends $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

Now, let's add up how much he spends each month on the hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 each month.

To find out how much he spends in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000 for the year.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly cost of the hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (yearly hanger and fuel) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

So, the first mixture costs \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts cost together.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.

We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. Each animal has one head, so if there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total.

Now, let's think about the legs. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs. We know that all the animals together have 70 legs.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many sheep there are:

1. If all 20 animals were geese, they would have 20 * 2 = 40 legs.
2. But we know there are 70 legs in total, so the extra legs must come from the sheep.
3. Each sheep has 2 extra legs compared to a goose (4 legs - 2 legs = 2 extra legs).
4. To find out how many sheep there are, we can see how many extra legs we have: 70 legs - 40 legs = 30 extra legs.
5. Since each sheep gives us 2 extra legs, the number of sheep is 30 extra legs / 2 extra legs per sheep = 15 sheep.

So, Lee has 15 sheep on his farm.

60 math teachers × 6 hours = 360 hours

So, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has. So, we need to find 3/4 of 120:
   - 120 divided by 4 is 30.
   - 3 times 30 is 90.
   - So, Kassidy has $90.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we add 60 to Kassidy's 90:
   - 90 + 60 = 150.
   - So, Rayna has $150.
4. Now, let's add up all the money they have together:
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.
   - Total: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.
5. If they share the money equally, we need to divide the total by 3:
   - 360 divided by 3 is 120.

So, each person would have $120 if they share the money equally.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Sarah's basketball game has 4 parts, and each part is 12 minutes long. So, we need to add up all these parts:

12 minutes + 12 minutes + 12 minutes + 12 minutes = 48 minutes

That's how long the game is without any extra time. But because the game was tied at the end, they played for 5 more minutes. So, we add those 5 minutes to the 48 minutes:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

So, the whole game lasted 53 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many employees are in management. The problem says 20% of the 50 employees are management. 

To find 20% of 50, we can do:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. The problem says 30% of the management employees do this.

To find 30% of 10, we can do:
\[ 30\% \times 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, 3 employees oversee the entire company.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to know how much of each ingredient Svetlana uses for one muffin:
- 5 tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 0.25 tablespoons of salt

Now, we want to find out how much of these ingredients she needs for 16 muffins. We can do this by multiplying the amount needed for one muffin by 16.

For flour:
- 5 tablespoons per muffin × 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons

For sugar:
- 3 tablespoons per muffin × 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons

For salt:
- 0.25 tablespoons per muffin × 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total amount of dry ingredients:
- 80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds of candy.

Now, they want to share this candy equally. There are 3 people, so we need to divide the total candy by 3:
12 pounds ÷ 3 people = 4 pounds per person.

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

First, we need to find out how much Adam spent on the candies.

For the type A candies:
- Adam bought 7 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.5.
- So, 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.5.

For the type B candies:
- Adam bought 10 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.75.
- So, 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.5.

Now, let's add the cost of both types of candies to find the total:
- Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Adam gave the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from what he paid:
- Change = $15 - $11 = $4.

So, Adam got $4 in change.

2. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
3. The first 8 days were all good.
4. The next 8 days were all bad.
5. The next 8 days were all neutral.
6. This means the last 6 days are the ones we need to figure out.

Now, the next three days are:

So, the last 6 days look like this:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good
- (The rest are neutral, so 3 more neutral days)

Let's count the good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 6 days: 2 good days

So, in total, we have:
- 8 + 2 = 10 good days

1. First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is right now. The problem says it's 20 feet tall. But we need to change this to inches because the final height we want is in inches. We know that 1 foot is the same as 12 inches. So, 20 feet is:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we want the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. So, we need to find out how much more it needs to grow:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the growth per day:
   \[
   360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days}

2. Then, 8 more dogs come to the shelter. Now, there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in total.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. So now, he has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James goes back, he finds out there are twice as many dogs as before. So, 12 dogs become 12 x 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy more toys for these 24 dogs. He already has 12 toys, so he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these 12 toys, James has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
7. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. Now, there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
8. James needs to have enough toys for 21 dogs. He already has 24 toys, so he has 24 - 21 = 3 extra toys.

Shania made her dress longer by adding 50% more to its original length. That means if the dress was 100 cm long, she would add 50 cm to it. She also added 20 cm of lace at the bottom.

So, if the final dress is 140 cm long, we need to figure out how long it was before she added the extra 50% and the 20 cm of lace.

First, let's take away the 20 cm of lace:
140 cm - 20 cm = 120 cm

Now, the 120 cm is 150% of the original length (because 100% is the original length, and she added 50%).

To find the original length, we need to figure out what 100% is. We can do this by dividing 120 cm by 1.5 (which is the same as 150%):

120 cm ÷ 1.5 = 80 cm

- For ""rabbit"" mode:
  - If it takes 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn, then it takes 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

We have two sets of kids: one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. We also know that when we add up the ages of all the kids, it equals 44.

Let's call the age of one of the triplets ""R"" (for ""Rabbit"" to make it fun). Then, the age of one of the twins would be ""R + 7"" (because the twin is 7 years older).

Now, we have:
- Two twins, so their total age is 2 × (R + 7).
- Three triplets, so their total age is 3 × R.

When we add these together, it should equal 44:
\[ 2 \times (R + 7) + 3 \times R = 44 \]

Let's break it down:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out what ""R"" is. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ R = 30 \div 5 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old. Now, we need to find out how old one of the twins is. Since the twin is 7 years older:
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

John has 3 hours before dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 times 60, which is 180 minutes.

If John has 180 minutes before dinner and he needs 80 minutes to finish his homework, he can nap for 180 - 80 minutes. That's 100 minutes.

5 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we know the total cost of the lollipops is $2.00, so the rest of the money must have been spent on the candies. Let's find out how much the candies cost:

Total cost - Cost of lollipops = Cost of candies
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, the 4 candies cost $1.20. Now, let's find out how much one candy costs:

$1.20 ÷ 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we know:
- Each lollipop costs $0.40
- Each candy costs $0.30

Next, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. Let's calculate it:

10 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies × $0.30 per candy = $3.00

In ten years, Rong saves:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Now, let's figure out how many coins Neil saves. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. First, we need to find out what 2/5 of 20 coins is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, the vaccines cost $40.

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of \( T \), which means:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

Now, we need to solve for \( T \). We can do this by moving the \( 0.60T \) to the other side of the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so that's 3 dollars.

Now, let's count how many of each fruit are in the crate:
- There are 5 bananas.
- There are 12 apples.
- There are 7 oranges.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:
- For the bananas: 5 bananas × 1 dollar each = 5 dollars.
- For the apples: 12 apples × 50 cents each = 6 dollars.
- For the oranges: 7 oranges × 3 dollars each = 21 dollars.

- Blue squares: 18
- Green squares: 24
- White squares: 12

Total number of squares:

   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]
   Marta has 105 points. That's like having 105 stickers!

Now, let's add up all the points to see how many the class has in total:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. To find out how many more points they need, we subtract the total points they have from 400:
\[
400 - 255 = 145
\]

So, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own. So, we need to count how many grandchildren Great Grandma Jones has:
   - 3 children × 3 grandchildren each = 9 grandchildren.
3. Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own. So, we need to count how many great grand-babies Great Grandma Jones has:
   - 9 grandchildren × 3 great grand-babies each = 27 great grand-babies.

So, if all the family shows up at the family reunion, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Greta gets $2400 in her paycheck. 

First, she puts half of it into her retirement. Half of $2400 is:
\[ 2400 \div 2 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement.

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car. To find 20% of $2400, we can do:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she pays $480 for her car.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left. We start with $2400 and subtract the $1200 for retirement and the $480 for her car:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 pencils are missing. So, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box.

First, we subtract the missing pencils from the total number of pencils the box can hold:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, the city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we need to find out how many fireworks that is in total:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Now, Hannah can only see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many that is, we do:
40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Hannah also has her own fireworks to set off. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, we need to find out how many fireworks that is:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, to find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we add the fireworks she can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

So, Hannah will see 135 fireworks in total!

   - They meet 7 more friends there: 13 + 7 = 20
   So, there are 20 people in total.

2. **Next, let's figure out how many drinks and snacks each seat can hold:**
   - Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

3. **Now, let's calculate how many drinks and snacks are needed for 20 seats:**
   - Drinks: 20 seats × 2 drinks per seat = 40 drinks
   - Snacks: 20 seats × 3 snacks per seat = 60 snacks

4. **Finally, let's find out how much money they spend:**
   - Each drink costs $2, so 40 drinks × $2 = $80
   - Each snack costs $2, so 60 snacks × $2 = $120
   - Total cost: $80 + $120 = $200

So, the group spent **200 dollars** on snacks and drinks.

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds.
3. When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary work together, their trucks can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Now, let's add up what Gissela and Gordy can carry together:
4,000 pounds (Gissela) + 4,800 pounds (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to see how much more is needed to reach 11,600 pounds:
11,600 pounds (total) - 8,800 pounds (Gissela and Gordy) = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know there are 6 girls and each girl ate 3 dumplings. So, we need to find out how many dumplings all the girls ate together. We do this by multiplying the number of girls by the number of dumplings each girl ate:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
So, the girls ate 18 dumplings in total.

Next, we know there are 8 boys, including Larry, and each boy ate 1 more dumpling than each girl. Since each girl ate 3 dumplings, each boy ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
Now, we need to find out how many dumplings all the boys ate together. We do this by multiplying the number of boys by the number of dumplings each boy ate:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]
So, the boys ate 32 dumplings in total.

To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings the girls ate to the number of dumplings the boys ate:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings in total.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much money Gerald and Julia each get from the $100. They are dividing it in a ratio of 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

1. We add the parts of the ratio: 3 + 2 = 5 parts
2. Each part is worth: $100 ÷ 5 = $20
3. Gerald's share is: 3 parts × $20 = $60
4. Julia's share is: 2 parts × $20 = $40

Now, Gerald spends $10 on a book. We need to find out how much money he has left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. The cat can run 15 feet every second. So, if the cat is 5 times faster, we need to find out how fast the turtle goes.

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} \div 5 = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we know the turtle can crawl 3 feet every second. We want to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

1. The firefighters want to raise $6300 in total.
2. After 3 hours, they have already raised $2100.
3. To find out how much more they need to raise, we subtract what they have from their goal:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]
   So, they need to raise $4200 more.

4. Now, we need to figure out how much they raise each hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we divide:
   \[
   2100 \div 3 = 700
   \]
   So, they raise $700 every hour.

5. To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide:
   \[
   4200 \div 700 = 6
   \]
   So, they need 6 more hours to raise the rest of the money.

6. Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we add the 6 more hours they need:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we know that the city uses 40% of the water from the river. That means out of every 100 parts of water, the city takes 40 parts.

2. Now, out of the 40 parts that the city takes, 80% is used for industrial stuff. So, we need to find out what 80% of 40 is. We can do this by multiplying 40 by 80% (or 0.80):
   \[
   40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   So, 32 parts out of the 40 parts are used for industrial purposes.

3. To find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water from the total water the city uses:
   \[
   40 - 32 = 8

First, we need to figure out how much ice cream the factory can make in one hour for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in one hour, it makes 100 quarts ÷ 2 = 50 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in one hour, it makes 50 quarts ÷ 4 = 12.5 quarts.

Now, let's see how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 48 hours, it makes 50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 48 hours, it makes 12.5 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total:
- Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the factory would make 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

- For the cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 * 2.50 = $10.
- For the mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4 each is 3 * 4 = $12.
- For the blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1 each is 13 * 1 = $13.

Now, let's add all these amounts together to find the total before the discount:
$15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. To find out how much he saves, we need to calculate 10% of $50:
10% of $50 is 0.10 * 50 = $5.

- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- So, $6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops.

But remember, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, let's see how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with her $6.00:
- $6.00 ÷ $3.00 (cost of 2 scoops) = 2 sets.

For each set of 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for 2 sets:
- 2 sets × 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free) = 6 scoops.

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

4. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's figure out how many days are in two weeks:
- 1 week = 7 days
- 2 weeks = 7 days + 7 days = 14 days

Now, let's see how many pieces of candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces each day
- In 14 days, Ginger eats 4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces

So, Ginger has:
- 100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Next, let's see how many pieces of candy Amy eats in 14 days:
- Amy eats 3 pieces each day
- In 14 days, Amy eats 3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces

So, Amy has:
- 100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

Now, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces
- Ginger has 44 pieces
- The difference is 58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

James went to pick blueberries. It cost him $20 just to go there. Then, for every pound of blueberries he picked, it cost him $1.5. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

First, let's find out how much it cost him to pick the blueberries:
- The cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost for 30 pounds of blueberries is 30 pounds * $1.5 per pound = $45.
- So, the total cost for picking is $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's see how much it would cost to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- At the store, blueberries cost $2.5 per pound.
- For 30 pounds, it would cost 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:
- Savings = $75 - $65 = $10.

Next, the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
- So, the cheese has \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

Then, the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same as the cheese).
- Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
- So, the ham has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add all the calories together:
- Eggs: 450 calories
- Cheese: 240 calories

First, we need to figure out how many taps Helga makes with her feet when her arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

1. **When her arms are at her sides:**
   - She dances for 3 minutes (because she dances for 5 minutes total, and 2 of those minutes her arms are raised).
   - With her right foot, she can tap 300 times in one minute.
   - So, in 3 minutes, her right foot taps: \(300 \times 3 = 900\) times.
   - With her left foot, she can tap 250 times in one minute.
   - So, in 3 minutes, her left foot taps: \(250 \times 3 = 750\) times.

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - She dances for 2 minutes.
   - With both feet, she can tap 200 times in one minute.
   - So, in 2 minutes, each foot taps: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) times.

Now, let's add up all the taps:
- Right foot total: \(900 + 400 = 1300\) taps.

So, if Ron fixes the hole himself, it will cost him $195.

Now, let's see how much he saves by fixing it himself instead of letting it damage his car:
- Cost of car damage if not fixed: $450
- Cost of fixing the hole: $195

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
   - Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices per person.
   - So, 3 people * 8 slices each = 24 slices eaten.

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends:**
   - The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices per person.
   - So, 2 people * 9 slices each = 18 slices eaten.

4. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten by all friends = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (other two friends) = 42 slices.

Now, the problem says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe ""B"" inches. So, we can write this as:
\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

To find out what ""B"" is, we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many windows are in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows = 256 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many of these windows Hannah smashed:
- She smashed a quarter of the students' car windows.
- A quarter means 1/4.
- So, the number of students' windows she smashed is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Now, let's look at the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many of these windows Hannah smashed:
- She smashed 3/4 of the teachers' car windows.
- 3/4 means three-quarters.
- So, the number of teachers' windows she smashed is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, Hannah smashed 112 windows in total.

112"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many spools of thread Candy has in total. We add up all the spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

So, the total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

Now, to find out what percent of the spools are blue, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

To make it easier, we can simplify \(\frac{60}{150}\):
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, we multiply \(\frac{2}{5}\) by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

40%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we start with 5000 people at 8:00. By midday, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ 5000 \div 5 = 1000 \]
\[ 1000 \times 2 = 2000 \]
So, 2000 people had voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]
So, 3000 people had not voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2 out of every 3 of these remaining people had voted. So, we need to find out how many that is:
\[ 3000 \div 3 = 1000 \]
\[ 1000 \times 2 = 2000 \]
So, 2000 more people had voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."

First, we need to figure out how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. He chews 4 pieces every day, so we multiply 4 by 30:
\[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \]
So, Parker will chew 120 pieces of gum in 30 days.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he needs. Each pack has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each pack:
\[ 120 \div 15 = 8 \]
So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many smores everyone wants to eat. 

- There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 smores. So, 9 kids times 2 smores each equals 18 smores for the kids.
- There are 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 smore. So, 6 adults times 1 smore each equals 6 smores for the adults.

Now, let's add the smores for the kids and the adults together:
- 18 smores for the kids + 6 smores for the adults = 24 smores in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers we need. Each sleeve makes 8 smores.

- To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve can make: 24 smores ÷ 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Finally, we need to know how many boxes of graham crackers we need. Each box has 3 sleeves.

- To find out how many boxes we need, we divide the total number of sleeves by the number of sleeves per box: 3 sleeves ÷ 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know Dora is 15 years old.
2. Dora's father's age is 8 more than twice Dora's age. So, we do the math:
   - Twice Dora's age is 15 * 2 = 30.
   - Then, 8 more than 30 is 30 + 8 = 38.
   - So, Dora's father is 38 years old.
3. Dora's mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age:
   - 38 - 4 = 34.
   - So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.
4. Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
   - Dora's age: 15
   - Father's age: 38
   - Mother's age: 34
   - Total: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

- A science book that also weighs 2 pounds
- A French book that weighs 4 pounds
- An English book that weighs 3 pounds
- A history book that weighs twice as much as her English book

Now, let's find out how much the history book weighs:
- The English book weighs 3 pounds, so the history book weighs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pounds.

Next, we add up all the weights:
- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

So, the total weight is:
\[ 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there are 100 voters, 20% of 100 is 20 votes. So, candidate A got 20 votes.

2. Next, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. If candidate A got 20 votes, then 50% more is half of 20, which is 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C got. We know there are 100 votes in total. If candidate A got 20 votes and candidate B got 30 votes, then together they got 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

4. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total votes: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

First, Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, we need to find out how many apples Beck has. We do this by subtracting 23 from 100:

100 - 23 = 77

So, Beck has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Now, we need to figure out how many apples each of them has after this.

Boris gives away 10 apples, so he now has:
100 - 10 = 90 apples

Beck receives 10 apples, so he now has:
77 + 10 = 87 apples

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - So, for the giant cubes, he uses \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) ounces of water.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - So, for the medium cubes, he uses \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) ounces of water.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - So, for the small cubes, he uses \( 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \) ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water he used:
- Total water used = \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, to find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left = \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also tells us that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we take away $2 from the price of the gallon jar, we can find out how much a half-gallon jar costs:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]
So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to figure out how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars. If one gallon jar costs $5, then 10 gallon jars will cost:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
So, she spent $50 on the gallon jars.

Now, let's find out how much she spent on 16 half-gallon jars. If one half-gallon jar costs $3, then 16 half-gallon jars will cost:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]
So, she spent $48 on the half-gallon jars.

Finally, to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:

- The rest like to play video games or play music.

Now, the tricky part is that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like basketball, twice that number is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, 10 students like to play music.

Now, let's add up all the students we know about:
- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- 10 students like to play music.

That's a total of:

Now, he gets his tomatoes from a new place where each tomato costs 40 cents. So, every day, he spends:
500 tomatoes × 40 cents = 200 dollars

To find out how much he saves each day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:
250 dollars - 200 dollars = 50 dollars

Since there are 7 days in a week, to find out how much he saves in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

- Two 4-week months have 2 x 28 = 56 days.

Next, we need to know how many of these days are weekdays and how many are weekends. Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days, so:
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 5 = 20 weekdays.
- In 4 weeks, there are 4 x 2 = 8 weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are 2 x 20 = 40 weekdays.

To find 90% of 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \]
So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 

To find 50% of 40:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \]
So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]
So, she gets 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Large buttons: 20

To find the total number of small buttons, we add the small buttons together:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This means:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of people who said ""no"" is 11. Since the number of people who said ""yes"" is twice that, we have:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Krissa needs 11 shirts for the extra-small size.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small shirts.
   - So, 11 students need extra-small, and twice that is 22 students for small shirts.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four fewer students need medium shirts than small shirts.
   - So, 22 students need small shirts, and 4 fewer is 18 students for medium shirts.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts.
   - So, 18 students need medium shirts, and half of that is 9 students for large shirts.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts.
   - So, 9 students need large shirts, and 6 more is 15 students for extra-large shirts.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:
- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The bag is marked at $140, and it has a 5% discount. 

To find 5% of $140, we do:
\[ 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount is $7.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133.

133"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many songs John has in total. He has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist:
\[ 20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long all these songs will play. Each song is 10 hours long. So, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
\[ 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last for 60000 hours in total.

60000"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we have 50 people. Out of these, 20% think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we do:
20% of 50 = 20/100 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we have 50 people in total, and 10 of them already picked horse #2. So, the number of people left is:
50 - 10 = 40 people

Next, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we do:
60% of 40 = 60/100 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we have 40 people left, and 24 of them picked horse #7. So, the number of people left is:
40 - 24 = 16 people

These 16 people think horse #12 will win.

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if 6 is one third, then the total number of Pomeranians must be 6 times 3, which is 18.

2. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of all the puppies, then to find the total number of puppies, we need to figure out what one third is and then add it to the two thirds we already know.

3. To find one third, we can divide 18 by 2, which gives us 9. So, one third of the puppies is 9.

4. Now, if one third is 9 and two thirds is 18, then the total number of puppies is 9 (one third) plus 18 (two thirds), which equals 27.

So, Jana has 27 puppies!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Jayden had $70 from selling his pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance. Half of $90 is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45, which is $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract what he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

85"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class.

We have three houses that need shingles. The total number of shingles needed for all three houses is 250 cases.

1. The first house needs half as many shingles as the second house.
2. The third house needs double the number of shingles as the first house.

Let's use a simple letter to represent the number of shingles the first house needs. We'll call it ""x.""

- The first house needs \( x \) shingles.
- The second house needs twice as many as the first, so it needs \( 2x \) shingles.
- The third house needs double the first, so it also needs \( 2x \) shingles.

Now, we add up all the shingles needed for the three houses:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's see. Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, Leila spent 3 times 2, which is $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, Jack spent 5 times 1, which is $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3. So, Chase spent 1 times 3, which is $3.

Now, to find out how much they all spent together, we add up what each of them spent: $6 + $5 + $3. That's $14.

So, they spent $14 in total to make the salad for the potluck.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than bananas. First, we need to find out what 45% of 200 is. 

45% of 200 is:
\[ 45 \div 100 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. If he has 200 bananas, then he has:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \] pears.

Now, to find out how many fruits George has in total, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total.

490"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Marissa had $80. She bought a ball for $20, so she spent $20. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left. We do this by subtracting the cost of the ball from the money she had:

$80 - $20 = $60

So, Marissa has $60 left. Now, she uses this money to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the money she has left by the cost of one candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

First, we need to figure out how many oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. We know that for 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. So, for 4 liters, he would need:

5 kilograms × 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges

Next, we need to find out how much 20 kilograms of oranges cost. We know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, the total cost would be:

20 kilograms × $3 per kilogram = $60

So, Sam would need to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

Ezra read 300 books this hour. That's a lot of books! Then, Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, we need to add those 150 books to the 300 books Ezra already read:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]
So, Ezra has read 450 books in total.

Now, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. If Ezra read 300 books, then Ahmed must have read half of that:
\[ 300 \div 2 = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books.

To find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, together, they have read 600 books.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.

**Monday:**
- Tanya taught 4 classes and worked for 5 hours.
- She gets $15 for each hour she works.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns: 5 hours × $15/hour = $75.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day.
- So, her total for Monday is: $75 + $5 = $80.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya taught 2 classes and worked for 2 hours.
- She gets $15 for each hour she works.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns: 2 hours × $15/hour = $30.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5.
- So, her total for Wednesday is: $30.

**Total for both days:**
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30
- Total: $80 + $30 = $110

So, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The perfume company has two types of scents: vanilla and fruity. They want to see which one sells more.

- They have 4 different vanilla scents, and they sell 5 of each vanilla scent.
- They have 8 different fruity scents, and they sell 2 of each fruity scent.

First, let's find out how many vanilla scents they sold in total:
- If they sell 5 of each vanilla scent and they have 4 vanilla scents, then:
  5 (sales per scent) × 4 (vanilla scents) = 20 vanilla scents sold.

Next, let's find out how many fruity scents they sold in total:
- If they sell 2 of each fruity scent and they have 8 fruity scents, then:
  2 (sales per scent) × 8 (fruity scents) = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents:
- We subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
  20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4 more vanilla scents sold.

So, 4 more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants, and each one costs $3. So, we do:

20 eggplants × $3 per eggplant = $60

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We need to find out how much more money he needs to make. We do this by subtracting the money he already made from the total he wants:

$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount of money he still needs by the number of ears of corn:

$75 ÷ 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how many hours Tatiana has in total over the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. So, we add those together:
7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract those 3 hours from the total 12 hours:
12 - 3 = 9 hours left

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find out how much time that is, we divide 9 by 3:
9 ÷ 3 = 3 hours

So, she spends 3 hours playing video games. We subtract those 3 hours from the 9 hours left:
9 - 3 = 6 hours

That means she spends 6 hours playing soccer. To find out what percentage of her weekend this is, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and then multiply by 100:
(6 ÷ 12) × 100 = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we need to calculate 3/5 of 25. 

3/5 of 25 is the same as 3 × (25 ÷ 5) = 3 × 5 = 15 pencils.

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back. The museum is 150 miles away, and Jack drives at 75 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes to drive one way, we divide the distance by the speed:
\[ \text{Time one way} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack has to drive to the museum and then drive back home, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, we add the time he spends driving to the time he spends at the museum:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

First, we need to figure out how many wheels Henry needs for all the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has 57 cars. So, we do:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels for the cars.

Next, we need to figure out how many wheels he needs for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, we do:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels Henry needs:
228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels in total.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels he needs from the number of wheels in the box:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels left.

So, the number of wheels left is 276.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. If a laptop costs $1000 and you get a 20% discount, that means you save 20 out of every 100 dollars. 

To find out how much you save, you can do this:
- First, figure out what 20% of $1000 is. You can do this by multiplying $1000 by 20 and then dividing by 100.
- So, $1000 times 20 is 20,000.
- Then, 20,000 divided by 100 is 200.

This means you save $200. Now, to find out how much you have to pay, you subtract the savings from the original price:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of these movies are in series, so:
   - \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. For the series movies, he can get them for \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie. A normal movie costs $10, so:
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{10}{6} = 1.67 \) dollars (rounded to two decimal places).
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 1.67 = 334 \) dollars (rounded to the nearest dollar).

4. Now, we have 400 movies left (600 - 200 = 400).
5. Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies:
   - Number of older movies: \( 400 \times 0.4 = 160 \).
   - Cost of each older movie: $5.
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

6. The rest of the movies are newer:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10.
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

7. Finally, we add up all the costs:
   - Total cost for series movies: $334
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400

First, we need to find out how much Winston spent on each type of fruit:

1. **Peaches:**
   - He picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - Peaches cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, 6 pounds × $2.00 = $12.00 for peaches.

2. **Plums:**
   - He picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - Plums cost $1.00 per pound.
   - So, 8 pounds × $1.00 = $8.00 for plums.

3. **Apricots:**
   - He picked 6 pounds of apricots.
   - Apricots cost $3.00 per pound.
   - So, 6 pounds × $3.00 = $18.00 for apricots.

Now, we add up all the costs to find out how much Winston spent in total:
- $12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Driving Time and Speed:**
   - The Llesis family drove for 6 hours in total.
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at a speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Distance Driven:**
   - To find out how far they drove, we multiply the time they drove by their speed.
   - So, \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Hiking Speed:**
   - They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \div 2 = 25\) miles per hour.
   - So, their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.

4. **Distance Hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - To find out how far they hiked, we multiply the time they hiked by their hiking speed.
   - So, \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Total Distance:**
   - To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points for doing different things in the game:
- 10 points for every enemy they jump on
- 5 points for each berry they collect
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level

Ava does a few things differently:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma
- She collects 3 more berries than Emma
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma

Let's figure out how many more points Ava gets compared to Emma.

1. **Enemies:**
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points from enemies for Emma: \( 10E \)
   - Points from enemies for Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Berries:**
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points from berries for Emma: \( 5B \)
   - Points from berries for Ava: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Timer:**
   - If Emma has \( T \) seconds left on the timer, Ava has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points from timer for Emma: \( 30T \)
   - Points from timer for Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's add up all the points for both Ava and Emma:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
  \]
  Simplify Ava's score:
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

Finally, let's find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

But since we want to know how many more points Ava has, we take the absolute value:
\[
25

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Four friends bought four pizzas for 64 dollars. Two of those pizzas together cost 30 dollars. So, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost, and they cost the same amount.

First, we need to find out how much money was left for the other two pizzas. We do this by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

Now, we have 34 dollars left for the other two pizzas. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to split 34 dollars equally between them. We do this by dividing 34 by 2:
34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

- 3 rides/day × 5 days = 15 rides

Next, on two other days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days. So, on these special days, they ride:
- 2 × 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day
- 6 rides/day × 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days together:
- 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Bob started with 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. We don't know how many of these were orange and how many were white, but we need to find out how many white ones he got.
3. After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

- Let's say Bob bought \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish.
- We know that \( x + y = 17 \) because he bought 17 fish in total.
- After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).
- According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so \( 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \).

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2 \times (4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To check:
- If Bob bought 4 white fish, then he bought \( 5 + 2 \times 4 = 5 + 8 = 13 \) orange fish.
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

   - So, for 50 miles, he uses: 50 miles ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas.

4. **Cost of Gas:**
   - The price of gas is $3 per gallon.
   - So, for 5 gallons, the cost is: 5 gallons × $3/gallon = $15.

So, Andy spends $15 on gas each week to go to work and back.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how much money Carrie got from her aunt. She got ten $20 bills and 140 quarters.

1. **Counting the $20 bills:**
   - Each $20 bill is worth $20.
   - Carrie has 10 of them.
   - So, 10 times $20 is $200.

2. **Counting the quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - So, 140 times $0.25 is $35.

Now, we know Carrie has $200 in $20 bills and $35 in quarters. That's a total of $235.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent. She spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the $20 bills.

3. **Spending the quarters:**
   - She spent all $35 in quarters.

4. **Spending part of the $20 bills:**
   - She spent 3/5 of the $200.
   - To find 3/5 of $200, we first find 1/5 of $200.
   - 1/5 of $200 is $40.
   - So, 3/5 of $200 is 3 times $40, which is $120.

Finally, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on the $20 bills:

- $35 (quarters) + $120 (part of the $20 bills) = $155.

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Ricardo gets. He has 5 tomato plants, and each plant gives him 22 tomatoes. So, we do:
5 plants × 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes

Next, we need to find out how many eggplants he gets. He has 8 eggplant plants, and each plant gives him 4 eggplants. So, we do:
8 plants × 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together:
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that Samwell's store sold 40 TVs in total.
2. One-fourth of these TVs are smart TVs. So, we need to find out what one-fourth of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 TVs are smart TVs.
3. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs. So, we need to find out what one-eighth of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 TVs are analog TVs.
4. Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs:
   \[
   40 - 10 - 5 = 25
   \]

So, Samwell's store sold 25 OLED TVs.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a math problem in school.

The trip costs $300. The school is being really nice and is going to pay for half of it. So, the school will pay $150. 

Now, John has $50. We need to find out how much more money he needs to have enough for the trip.

First, we see how much money is left after the school pays:
$300 - $150 = $150

Now, we see how much more John needs after using his $50:
$150 - $50 = $100

So, John still needs $100 more to pay for the trip.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Find out how cold it gets at night:**
   - During the day, it's 45 degrees.
   - At night, it's 33 degrees colder.
   - So, we need to subtract 33 from 45 to find the night temperature.
   - 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

2. **Figure out how much warmer we need to keep the house:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature goes below 32 degrees.
   - The temperature at night is 12 degrees.
   - We need to make sure the temperature is at least 32 degrees.
   - So, we need to add enough heat to get from 12 degrees to 32 degrees.
   - 32 - 12 = 20 degrees warmer.

3. **Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - We need to make the house 20 degrees warmer.
   - So, we divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs are needed.
   - 20 ÷ 5 = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many groups of 9 people we can make from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]
So, we have 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 people, and each person brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells 9 people in one group brought back:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]
Since 6 groups each brought back 18 seashells, we multiply:
\[ 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

1. First, we start with 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off. So, we subtract 47 from 172:
   - 172 - 47 = 125 people left on the train.
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train. So, we add 13 to 125:
   - 125 + 13 = 138 people on the train.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we subtract 38 from 138:
   - 138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train.

So, after all that, there are 100 people on the train.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day.
2. Each bottle cap is worth 25 cents, which is the same as $0.25.
3. In one day, the bottle caps he finds are worth:
   \[
   10 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how much he makes in 30 days. So, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
   \[
   2.50 \text{ dollars/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 75 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jamie made last Tuesday.

First, we need to know how much she makes for her regular work hours. Jamie works 8 hours a day and gets $20 for each hour. So, for 8 hours, she makes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much she makes for the extra hours. Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 3 extra hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. 

To find 150% of $20:
\[ 150\% \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 1.5 \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, for the 3 extra hours, she makes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she made for her regular hours and the extra hours:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

1. First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40.
   - To find 25% of $40, we can think of it as 25 out of 100, which is the same as 1 out of 4.
   - So, we divide $40 by 4: \( 40 \div 4 = 10 \).
   - The discount is $10.

2. Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
   - The original price is $40, and the discount is $10.
   - So, the sale price is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

3. Finally, we need to find out how much money Mike will have left if he pays with a $50 bill.
   - Mike pays $50, and the sale price is $30.

1. **Starting Number of Employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New Employees Each Month**: Every month, the company hires 20 new employees.
3. **Number of Months**: We need to find out how many employees there are after 3 months.

First, let's figure out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
- 20 new employees each month for 3 months = 20 * 3 = 60 new employees.

Now, let's add these new employees to the starting number of employees:
- Starting employees: 200
- New employees: 60
- Total employees after 3 months: 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

Next, we need to find out how much the company pays all these employees in 3 months. Each employee gets $4000 per month.

First, let's find out how much the company pays all employees in one month:
- 260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000 per month.

Now, let's find out how much the company pays in 3 months:
- $1,040,000 per month * 3 months = $3,120,000.

   - So, his new pay was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, Billy got another raise of $1.00.
   - So, his new pay was $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Pay:**
   - Sally started with $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting pay.
   - So, Sally's pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, he earns $11.50 × 20 = $230.
   - Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, she earns $10.50 × 20 = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
   - $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

Then, we add 11 to 139 to find out how many points Nikita scored:
139 plus 11 is 150.

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:

\[ 40 \times 25 = 1000 \]
So, there are 1000 students in total.

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are. Each class has 3 teachers, and there are 40 classes. So, we multiply 40 by 3:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \]
So, there are 120 teachers in total.

Now, Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find out how many stuffed goats she needs, we need to figure out what 30% of the total number of stuffed animals should be.

Let's say she buys \( x \) stuffed goats. Then the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + \( x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this step by step:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

Now, we want to know how far apart these cars will be after 2 hours. Here’s how we can figure it out:

1. **First Car:**
   - It goes 60 miles in 1 hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, it will go 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

2. **Second Car:**
   - It goes 70 miles in 1 hour.

3. **Difference:**
   - The second car goes 140 miles in 2 hours.
   - The first car goes 120 miles in 2 hours.
   - So, the difference is 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

After 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how many students passed in each grade:
- In third grade, 340 out of 500 students passed.
- In fourth grade, 40 out of 100 students passed.
- For fifth grade, we need to do a little more thinking. The problem says the fifth grade pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate. The fourth grade pass rate is 40 out of 100, which is 40%. So, the fifth grade pass rate is 2 times 40%, which is 80%. That means 80 out of every 100 fifth graders passed. Since there are 400 fifth graders, 80% of 400 is 320 students who passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed:
- Third grade: 340
- Fourth grade: 40
- Fifth grade: 320

Total students who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Next, we need to know the total number of students who took the test:
- Third grade: 500
- Fourth grade: 100
- Fifth grade: 400

Total students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:
- Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.70

To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100:
- 0.70 * 100 = 70%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

3. **Determine how long the mosaic can be:**
   - Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall.
   - If the mosaic is 3 inches tall and covers 12 square inches, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

So, they used and lost 21 marshmallows. We started with 35 marshmallows, so we subtract the 21 they used and lost:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we have 14 marshmallows left. Since there are 2 kids, we need to split these 14 marshmallows equally:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Jack and his 3 friends are playing at the arcade. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends can only play for half that time, so they play for 10 minutes with one quarter. His other friend is really good and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so that's 30 minutes with one quarter.

They all play for 4 hours, which is the same as 240 minutes.

Now, let's figure out how many quarters each person uses:

- Jack plays for 20 minutes with one quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he uses:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- The two friends who play for 10 minutes with one quarter each use:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each}
  \]
  Since there are two of them, they use:
  \[
  24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- The friend who plays for 30 minutes with one quarter uses:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
  \]

Now, let's add up all the quarters:
\[
12 \text{ quarters (Jack)} + 48 \text{ quarters (two friends)} + 8 \text{ quarters (one friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total amount of money used is:
\[
68 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 1700 \text{ cents}
\]

1700 cents is the same as 17 dollars.

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's think about this like a fun puzzle!

Tanya makes a special scrub that fits in a 10-ounce jar. She uses different things to make it: salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Here’s what we know:
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's use a simple number to start. If we say Tanya uses 1 ounce of citrus zest, then:
- She also uses 1 ounce of fragrance (same as zest).
- She uses 2 ounces of salt (twice as much as zest).
- She uses 2 ounces of sugar (same as salt).
- She uses 4 ounces of oil (twice as much as salt).

Now, let's add it all up:
- 1 ounce of zest
- 1 ounce of fragrance
- 2 ounces of salt
- 2 ounces of sugar
- 4 ounces of oil

Adding these together: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces.

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Okay, let's do this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much John spent on the goats. He bought 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, we multiply 3 by 500:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the cows. He bought 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, we multiply 2 by 1500:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount John spent:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Paul is getting ready for a big birthday party on Saturday, and he needs 63 cupcakes. He already has some cupcakes, 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones. 

First, let's add the cupcakes he already has:
8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

Now, Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:
63 cupcakes - 48 cupcakes = 15 cupcakes.

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, Joe has:
   \[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

3. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
   \[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

5. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. We start with 40 cars, subtract the 8 cars he sold, and then subtract the 16 cars he gave away:
   \[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe has 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We have a big number, $175,000, and that's all the money the charity got. But some of that money, $50,000, came from big groups, not the students. So, we need to find out how much the students raised.

First, we take the big number, $175,000, and subtract the money from the groups, $50,000:
\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

So, the students raised $125,000 together. Now, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide the total amount the students raised by the number of students:
\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, we need to find half of 8 hours:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time she walked on both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many minutes this is, we need to remember that 1 hour is 60 minutes. So, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"

1. First, Hunter saw 50 cars in the parking lot when he got to school.
2. Then, during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, we add those 20 cars to the 50 cars he already saw:
   \[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]
   Now there are 70 cars in the parking lot.
3. During the lunch break, half of the cars left. Half of 70 is:
   \[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]
   So, 35 cars left the parking lot.
4. To find out how many cars were left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the 35 cars that left from the 70 cars that were there:
   \[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

1. **Cycles per day**: John does 30 cycles of work each day.
2. **Tasks per cycle**: Each cycle has 5 tasks.

First, we need to find out how many tasks John does in one day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money John makes in one day:

2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.
4. To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought:
- She bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package has 11 tins.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought:
- She bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package has 6 tins.
- So, 6 packages times 6 tins per package equals 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food:
- We subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food.
- That's 88 tins of cat food minus 36 tins of dog food, which equals 52 tins.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards together. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then:
- Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards (because he has 3 times as many as PJ).
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards (because she has 12 more than Smendrick).

Now, we can add all their cards together to get the total:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to find out what \( P \) is. We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

   - The book needs to be sent 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges 8 cents for each mile.
     \[
     20 \text{ miles} \times 8 \text{ cents/mile} = 160 \text{ cents} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}

$30 x 2 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount she spends is:

- In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars.
- In the second week, he makes half of what he made in the first week, so that's 8,000 divided by 2, which is 4,000 bars.
- In the third week, he makes three times what he made in the first week, so that's 8,000 times 3, which is 24,000 bars.

   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes recording videos.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes writing songs.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup 6 days a week.
   - So, in one week, she spends \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes doing makeup.
   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes doing makeup.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends on TikTok in a month:

   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can think of it like this: the kangaroos together cover the whole distance in 18 hours.
   - So, if one kangaroo were to do it alone, it would take 3 times longer because there are 3 kangaroos sharing the work. That means one kangaroo would take 18 hours × 3 = 54 hours to cross the highway by itself.

2. **Now, let's think about the turtles:**
   - The turtles are much slower. Each turtle goes at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if a kangaroo takes 54 hours to cross the highway, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 54 hours × 2 = 108 hours for one turtle to cross the highway by itself.

3. **But we have 4 turtles working together:**
   - If 4 turtles are working together, they can share the work. So, instead of one turtle taking 108 hours, 4 turtles together will take 108 hours ÷ 4 = 27 hours to cross the highway.

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

The farmer wants to have 25 liters of milk a day. So, we need to find out how much more milk he needs:

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters more.

Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to get 10 more liters of milk. We do this by dividing the extra milk needed by the amount of milk one cow gives:

$5,000 (from working) + $200 (from brother) = $5,200 (total money Gabriel has)

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total money he has from the total cost:

$10,800 (total cost) - $5,200 (total money Gabriel has) = $5,600

So, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills. That means he has:
2 x 20 = 40 dollars.

Next, he buys six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs 2 dollars, so:
6 x 2 = 12 dollars for the squirt guns.

Then, he buys three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs 3 dollars, so:
3 x 3 = 9 dollars for the water balloons.

Now, let's add up how much he spent in total:
12 + 9 = 21 dollars.

Finally, we need to find out how much money Craig has left. We subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he started with:
40 - 21 = 19 dollars.

So, Craig has 19 dollars left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Jack has 60 dishes. That's a lot of dishes!
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if he has 60 dishes, he must have half that many socks. Half of 60 is 30. So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. If Jack has 30 socks, then Peter has 2 times 30, which is 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. If Jack has 60 dishes, then Peter has half of that, which is 30 dishes.

Now, let's add everything up:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.

So, the total number of socks is:
30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks

And the total number of dishes is:
60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

Adding the socks and dishes together:
90 socks + 90 dishes = 180

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180.

Miss Susan's class has 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total, so we subtract the students who are good at math only (5) and the students who are good at English only (8):

20 - 5 - 8 = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both subjects:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12 students are good at math.

So, the answer is 12."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Vicki is planning a big pop concert at her school. The concert will last for 2 hours, which is the same as 120 minutes. She wants to have a 10-minute break in the middle, so we need to take that time away from the total concert time.

120 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (break) = 110 minutes left for the groups to perform.

Now, each group needs some time to get on stage, perform, and then leave the stage. Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to leave the stage

So, each group needs a total of:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the time left by the time each group needs:
110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/group = 11 groups

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Brenda put $300 into a savings plan. This plan gives her extra money each year, and the extra money is three-quarters of the $300 she put in. We need to find out how much money she will have after 3 years.

1. First, let's figure out how much extra money she gets each year:
   - Three-quarters of $300 is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars.

2. Now, let's see how much extra money she gets over 3 years:
   - Each year, she gets $225.
   - Over 3 years, she gets \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \) dollars.

3. Finally, let's add the extra money to the original $300 to find the total amount:
   - The total amount is \( 300 + 675 = 975 \) dollars.

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have $975.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we have 40 white shirts. Half of these shirts have collars. So, we need to find out how many that is:
- Half of 40 is 20. So, 20 white shirts have collars.

Next, we need to find out how many white shirts don't have collars:
- If 20 white shirts have collars, then the rest, which is 40 - 20, don't have collars.
- So, 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We have 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. We need to find out how many don't have buttons:
- If 20 floral shirts have buttons, then the rest, which is 50 - 20, don't have buttons.
- So, 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Finally, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars:
- We have 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars.
- The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we need to figure out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Each tray can hold 30 eggs. So, we divide 900 by 30:

\[ 900 \div 30 = 30 \]

So, the farmer needs 30 trays.

Next, we need to find out how much money the farmer will make if he sells all the trays. Each tray is sold for $2.5. So, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. 

- In Farm X, he has 55 goats.
- In Farm Y, he has 45 goats.

He sold some goats from both farms:
- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm:
- In Farm X, after selling 10 goats, he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.
- In Farm Y, after selling 20 goats, he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."

First, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. He buys 2 pairs every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, we do:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays for each pair, we divide the total amount he spends by the number of pairs he buys:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of green food cost. Each basket of green food costs $25. So, if we buy 3 baskets, we do:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]
So, 3 baskets of green food cost $75.

Next, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of red food cost before the discount. Each basket of red food costs $18. So, if we buy 3 baskets, we do:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]
So, 3 baskets of red food cost $54 before any discounts.

Now, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food. Since we are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
So, we get a $6 discount on the red food.

To find the final cost of the red food after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]
So, 3 baskets of red food cost $48 after the discount.

Finally, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to clean these 45 rooms. We know it takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, we multiply 45 by 20:

45 × 20 = 900 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60:

900 ÷ 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

First, in the first year, the town builds 12 homes. That's easy to remember, right?

Next, in the second year, they build three times as many homes as they did in the first year. So, we need to multiply 12 by 3. That gives us 36 homes.

Now, in the third year, they count all the homes they've built so far and then build double that number. So, we need to add the homes from the first two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, we double that number: 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Finally, to find out how many homes they will have built over the three years, we add up all the homes from each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. I am 3 years younger than my brother. So if my brother is \( B \) years old, I am \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister. So if I am \( B - 3 \) years old, my sister is \( B - 3 - 2 \) or \( B - 5 \) years old.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. So if my brother is \( B \) years old, my mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. When you add all our ages together, it equals 87. So we can write this as:
   \[
   (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
   \]

Now, let's add all these together:
\[
B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87
\]

Combine all the \( B \) terms:
\[
6B - 9 = 87
\]

Add 9 to both sides to isolate the \( B \) term:
\[
6B = 96
\]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to find \( B \):
\[
B = 16

Now, the glue sticks come in packs of 8. We need to figure out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy to have at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:
\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to buy 7 packs to make sure he has enough glue sticks for everyone.

- Total sick people on the second day: 10 + 60 = 70

On the third day, all 70 people who are sick each make 6 more people sick. So, we have:
- 70 people from the second day
- Plus 70 people each making 6 more sick: 70 x 6 = 420 new sick people
- Total sick people on the third day: 70 + 420 = 490

On the fourth day, all 490 people who are sick each make 6 more people sick. So, we have:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Next, we need to figure out how much Julieta got. Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we can think of it as 10 out of every 100 parts of Rafaela's total. So, we calculate 10% of 800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

This means Julieta got $80 less than Rafaela. So, we subtract 80 from 800 to find out how much Julieta got:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta got $720 in tips.

Now, to find out how much they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we do in class!

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21, we can divide $21 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle:
- $21 ÷ 7 = $3
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8, we can divide $8 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle:
- $8 ÷ 4 = $2
So, one bottle of water costs $2.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. Let's calculate the total cost:

For the soda:
- 3 bottles × $3 per bottle = $9

For the water:
- 2 bottles × $2 per bottle = $4

Finally, we add the cost of the soda and the water together:
- $9 + $4 = $13

So, David will need $13 to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

13"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. David has $12.48 and he wants to buy 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03. 

First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts cost. We do this by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost of each bolt:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

So, 16 bolts cost $0.48.

Next, we need to find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts.

12.00"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she earns in one hour, we divide the total money she earned by the number of hours she worked:

\[ 33 \div 3 = 11 \]

So, Ella earns $11 for each hour she walks dogs.

Now, if she works for 12 hours, we need to find out how much she will earn. We do this by multiplying the amount she earns per hour by the number of hours she works:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

132"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, we add those together:
52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Then, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many he loses, we divide 80 by 4:
80 ÷ 4 = 20 marbles

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total he had:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles

So, Paul has 60 marbles left. 

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to find out how many questions Amy got right in each section:

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
   - There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
   - Amy got 80% of them right.
   - To find out how many she got right, we do: \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\).
   - Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she gets \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy got 90% of them right.
   - To find out how many she got right, we do: \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\).
   - Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she gets \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points.

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy got 60% of them right.
   - To find out how many she got right, we do: \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\).
   - Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points.

Now, we add up all the points she got:
- Points from multiple-choice: 8
- Points from true/false: 18
- Points from long-answer: 15

So, the total points Amy scored is:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

Therefore, Amy scored 41 points."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - Isaias has 300 chickens.
   - He plans to sell 3/5 of them.
   - To find 3/5 of 300, we do:
     \[
     300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 300 \times 0.6 = 180
     \]
   - So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

2. **Calculate the total money Isaias will make from selling the chickens:**
   - Each chicken is sold for $50.
   - For 180 chickens, the total money is:
     \[
     180 \times 50 = 9000
     \]
   - So, Isaias will make $9000 from selling the chickens.

3. **Find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens:**
   - Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
   - The profit is the total money made minus the cost of the chickens.
   - So, the cost of the chickens is:
     \[
     9000 - 2000 = 7000
     \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

**Final Answer:**
7000"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade together. Julie sold 14 glasses. That means the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold the rest. 

First, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:
32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's) = 18 glasses (boys')

Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 glasses ÷ 2 = 9 glasses each

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
14 glasses (Julie's) - 9 glasses (Micah's) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair. That's a lot of money!
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 of what she spent on her hair for a manicure. So, we need to find 1/4 of $400.
   \[
   \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
   So, the manicure cost $100.
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure for a pedicure. So, we need to find 3/4 of $100.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   So, the pedicure cost $75.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find out how much Iris spent in total:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 for each meter. So, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope. We do this by multiplying the length of the rope by the price per meter:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will get 40 dollars from selling the rope.

Next, Sarah wants to use this money to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 for each meter. Since she wants to buy a rope that is also 20 meters long, we need to find out how much the new rope will cost. We do this by multiplying the length of the new rope by the price per meter:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the new rope will cost 30 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope. We do this by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will have 10 dollars left over after buying the new rope.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, if we want to find out how old she is right now, we can do a simple subtraction:

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is 8 years old right now.

Next, we need to figure out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If she is 8 years old now, three times her age would be:

3 × 8 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. We can do this by subtracting her current age from 24:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24 years old, which is three times her current age.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to find out how much each pack of bacon costs. Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10. So, each pack of bacon costs:
\[ 10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for the strawberries is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."

Elaina's final concert is special because it's twice as long as her usual concerts, and she adds a 15-minute encore at the end. The whole thing lasts 65 minutes.

First, we need to figure out how long the concert was without the encore. We do this by subtracting the 15 minutes of the encore from the total time:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Now, we know that the 50 minutes is twice as long as her usual concert. So, to find out how long her usual concert is, we divide 50 minutes by 2:
50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Argo has 200 toys at first. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, we add up all the toys he gave away:
40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, we subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with:
200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Tuesday, the shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, so that's 2 times 125, which is 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them all up:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We have 50 microphones, and 20% of them can't be paired up. First, we need to find out how many microphones can't be paired up.

20% of 50 is like saying 20 out of 100, which is the same as 1 out of 5. So, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones can't be paired up. Now, we need to find out how many microphones are left to pair up:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to pair up these 40 microphones. Each pair has 2 microphones, so we divide 40 by 2:

\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"Okay, let's count the birds Jerry saw!

1. First, Jerry saw 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. Then, he saw some birds flying overhead. The number of these birds is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the 6 birds he saw nesting. So, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6 is 4 birds.
3. Finally, he saw 3 groups of birds feeding, and each group had 8 birds. So, 3 groups of 8 birds is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total birds: \( 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \)

So, Jerry counted 34 birds in total."

55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Now, she put these 50 cookies into 5 jars, and she put the same number of cookies in each jar. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the 50 cookies by 5:

50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies in each jar.

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we need to find out how many petals all the orchids have together. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, we do:
5 orchids * 5 petals each = 25 petals for the orchids.

Next, we need to find out how many petals all the daisies have together. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, we do:
4 daisies * 10 petals each = 40 petals for the daisies.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the number of petals the orchids have from the number of petals the daisies have:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 more petals.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

1. Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden.
2. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we need to find one-fourth of 100:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 indoor plants.

3. Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking away the indoor plants:
   \[
   100 - 25 = 75
   \]
   So, there are 75 plants left.

4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we need to find two-thirds of 75:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We already know there are 75 plants left after the indoor plants, and 50 of those are outdoor plants. So, the number of flowering plants is:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25
   \]

6. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins really fast, at 121 meters every second.
2. The whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide 121 by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
   So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

3. Now, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find out how fast a whirligig spins, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

4. So, the salad and the yogurt together cost \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for all her food.
6. This means the two carrots together cost \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.
7. Since she eats two carrots, one carrot costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, we multiply these:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, Mark works 40 hours a week.

3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as much as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as much as Joe's.

Now, let's figure out how many times she mowed each lawn:
- If she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.
- And she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

So, in total, she mowed:
- Joe's lawn 1 time
- Kamala's lawn 3 times
- Alba's lawn 5 times

That's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times in total.

Since she got $6 for all the lawn mowing, and she mowed 9 times, she made $6 from mowing lawns.

Now, to find out how much she made from selling lemonade, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
- Total earnings: $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns: $6

So, $80 - $6 = $74

Tasha made $74 from selling lemonade.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how much material Jo needs for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs 2 yards ÷ 4 masks = 0.5 yards.
- If she wants to make 20 small masks, she will need 20 masks × 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

Next, let's figure out how much material she needs for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs 2.25 yards ÷ 3 masks = 0.75 yards.
- If she wants to make 8 large masks, she will need 8 masks × 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night. That's a lot of sleep!
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps. So, if he sleeps for 10 hours, he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He also walks his dog for 1 hour every day. That's a nice walk!

Now, let's add up all the time Harold spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

So, the total time spent is:
10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a whole day. So, the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. That's a total of 16 shoe boxes.

Now, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes to go fishing. 

To find out how many red shoe boxes he uses, we need to figure out what 1/3 of 9 is. If we split 9 into 3 equal parts, each part is 3. So, 1/3 of 9 is 3 red shoe boxes.

So, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's see how many are left:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left. 

Adding them together, Tim has 4 + 6 = 10 shoe boxes left.

The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, so he had 9 times 2, which is 18 books. But Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to take 2 away from 18. That means Joseph now has 18 minus 2, which is 16 books.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 is 6, so Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

So, Dean gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles in total.

Now, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total he started with:

30 - 16 = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

1. First, we know that Duncan is 60 years old right now.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.
3. The problem says that eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
4. So, if we let Adam's age four years ago be \( A \), then 52 = 2 \times \( A \).
5. To find \( A \), we divide 52 by 2: \( A = 52 \div 2 = 26 \).
6. This means Adam was 26 years old four years ago.
7. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26: 26 + 4 = 30.
8. Finally, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

Farmer Brown has a farm that is 200 acres big. Now, Farmer Smith's farm is a bit bigger. It's 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

First, we need to find out what twice Farmer Brown's farm is:
200 acres times 2 equals 400 acres.

Then, we add 100 acres to that:
400 acres plus 100 acres equals 500 acres.

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find out how many acres both farms have together, we add Farmer Brown's 200 acres to Farmer Smith's 500 acres:
200 acres plus 500 acres equals 700 acres.

So, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many packages Colby completes in one hour. The problem says he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we do:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how much money he makes in one hour. He gets paid $0.20 for each package. So, we multiply the number of packages by the amount he gets paid for each one:
40 packages × $0.20 = $8.00 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a whole workday. He works for 8 hours, so we multiply his hourly pay by the number of hours he works:
$8.00 × 8 hours = $64.00.

So, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

45 minutes × 4 = 180 minutes

Now, we know that John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes. We need to find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes. We do this by dividing 180 by 30:

180 minutes ÷ 30 minutes = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
- Each red balloon got 2 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.
- So, 20 red balloons × 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna.

Now, we know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. If 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, then the rest must have been thrown at the yellow balloons:
- Total pieces of bologna = 58
- Pieces thrown at red balloons = 40
- Pieces thrown at yellow balloons = 58 - 40 = 18

Each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna. So, to find out how many yellow balloons there are, we divide the total pieces thrown at yellow balloons by 3:
- Number of yellow balloons = 18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in one month. He drives 100 miles every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, we do:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many times Jon's car needs a tune-up. The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:
\[ 3000 \text{ miles} \div 1000 \text{ miles/tune-up} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice as much as he did on Tuesday. So, he works \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked: \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

So, Bruce works 23 hours in total over these three days."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **Cake**: The cake costs $11.
2. **Balloons**: They bought 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons. So, for 12 balloons, we need to figure out how many groups of 2 balloons there are in 12. That's 12 divided by 2, which is 6. So, 6 groups of 2 balloons cost 6 times $0.5, which is $3.
3. **Ice Cream**: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, and each tub costs $7. So, 2 tubs cost 2 times $7, which is $14.

Now, let's add up all the money they spent:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice Cream: $14

Total money spent: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine spent all their combined allowance, and they both got the same amount, we need to split the total money spent by 2 to find out how much each of them got:
- $28 divided by 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Then, there are twice as many students playing volleyball. So, that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. For soccer, there are 16 boys and 22 girls. So, the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, let's add all these students together:

First, we need to find out how many lollipops all the students sold together. If each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops, then:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much money they made from selling these lollipops. If each lollipop was sold for $0.8, then:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it cost to buy the lollipops. If each lollipop cost $0.5, then:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money the class raised, we subtract the cost from the money they made:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the class was able to raise 90 dollars from the profit of selling lollipops.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

We have a loaf of bread with 24 slices. Abby can eat 2 slices each day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices each day.

Now, let's add up how many slices they eat together each day:
- Abby eats 2 slices.
- Josh eats 4 slices.
- Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices each day.

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. We have 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices each day. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat each day:
- 24 slices ÷ 6 slices per day = 4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

10 years old - 5 years old = 5 years

Next, we need to know how many months are in 5 years:
5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have is:
60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 of these cups to make cinnamon tea. So, we need to find out how many cups are left for the chamomile and mint tea.

First, we subtract the cinnamon tea cups from the total:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

So, Lana has 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea. These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]

Each row has 4 cups. Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we need to split these 4 cups into 2 types of tea. So, we divide 4 by 2:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

\[ 8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Now, if the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he needs to get 24 berries in total, we need to find out how many berries he should get on each trip. We do this by dividing the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \text{ berries per trip} \]

So, the sloth needs to pick up 12 berries on each trip to get 24 berries in 8 hours.

10,000 ÷ 2 = 5,000 gallons

So, the tank starts with 5,000 gallons of water.

Next, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day to water their garden. We need to find out how much water they use in 6 days:

500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water they used in 6 days from the amount of water they started with in the tank:

5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water left in the tank.

Colby gets $150 every month to spend at the movies. He wants to know how many more movies he can see this month.

First, let's add up how much he has already spent:

- He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, 5 movies × $10 = $50.
- He saw 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, 8 movies × $7 = $56.
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, 2 tubs × $8 = $16.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, 4 boxes × $2 = $8.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
$50 (Fridays/Saturdays) + $56 (other days) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130.

Colby started with $150, so let's see how much he has left:
$150 - $130 = $20.

Today is Friday, and he wants to see a movie, get a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. Let's see how much that will cost:
- Movie ticket on Friday: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2

So, the total for tonight is:
$10 (movie) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford to see one more movie tonight.

Now, let's count how many movies he has seen in total:
- He already saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays.
- He already saw 8 movies on other days.
- He will see 1 more movie tonight.

So, the total number of movies he will see this month is:
5 + 8 + 1 = 14.

First, we need to figure out how many calories are in one mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one has 1/3 of that. So, we do:
600 ÷ 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 1/3 of that. So, we do:
450 ÷ 3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.

Now, we know Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls. To find out how many calories all the mini cinnamon rolls have, we multiply:
200 rolls × 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins. To find out how many calories all the mini blueberry muffins have, we multiply:
300 muffins × 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, to find the total number of calories in all the pastries, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

- On Wednesday, she picked the same as Tuesday, so that's another 78 Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs she picked each day. To do this, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days she picked them:

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus Jean's age.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

- Let's say Jean is \( J \) years old.
- Then Paul is \( J + 10 \) years old (because Paul is 10 years older than Jean).
- Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) \), which is \( 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know that the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find \( J \):
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 100 - 20 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old.

Now, let's find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

First, let's see how many widgets each machine can make:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets every hour.

Now, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a day:
- The Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- The WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's see how many widgets each machine makes in a month (30 days):
- The Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day × 30 days = 43200 widgets/month
- The WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day × 30 days = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's find out how much money each machine makes if each widget sells for $6:
- The Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets × $6/widget = $259200
- The WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets × $6/widget = $194400

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

Cameron comes to the hotel at 5 in the evening and leaves at 10 in the morning the next day. That's 17 hours in total. The hotel has two choices:
1. Pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
2. Pay 1600 pesos for 24 hours.

But Cameron has a smart idea! He pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and then 70 pesos for each extra hour. He stays 5 hours more, so:
5 hours * 70 pesos = 350 pesos

Now, let's add that to the first 12 hours:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron paid for 24 hours, it would cost 1600 pesos. So, the money he saves is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos!

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how much hay each animal needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, if a goat needs 5 pounds, twice that is 10 pounds, and 3 pounds less than 10 is 7 pounds. So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, let's count how much hay all the goats need:
- There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds.
- So, 15 goats times 5 pounds each is 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Next, let's count how much hay all the sheep need:
- There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds.
- So, 12 sheep times 7 pounds each is 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep together:
- 75 pounds for the goats plus 84 pounds for the sheep equals 159 pounds of hay.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars for each hour he works, and he worked for 6 hours. So, we do:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. We need to subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, John wants to put 100 dollars in the bank. We subtract that from the 250 dollars he has left:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the 150 dollars he has left:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, John wants to buy some pens, and each pen costs 25 dollars. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the 100 dollars by the cost of one pen:
\[ 100 \div 25 = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens.

The answer is:
4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many letters Craig spelled. Craig spelled 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply 20 by 15:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

So, Craig spelled 300 letters in total.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled. The problem says Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother spelled 350 letters in total.

Now, to find the total number of letters both Craig and his brother spelled together, we add the letters Craig spelled to the letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters they spelled after the ten rounds is:

First, we know that there are 8 children in each row. 

Next, we know that there are 7 rows for each school. 

And there are 5 different schools participating.

So, to find out how many children there are in total, we need to multiply these numbers together:

1. First, we multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows in each school:
   8 children/row × 7 rows = 56 children per school

2. Then, we multiply the number of children per school by the number of schools:
   56 children/school × 5 schools = 280 children

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, we do:
9 coupons × 100 bottles per coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, we do:
29 students × 2 bottles per student = 58 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are left for the teacher. We take the total number of bottles and subtract the number of bottles given to the students:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself!

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges $40 just to come to the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: She charges $35 for each hour of work. The job took 2.25 hours, so we need to multiply 2.25 by 35.
   - 2.25 hours × $35/hour = $78.75
3. **Parts Charge**: The job also used $60 worth of parts.

Now, we add all these costs together:
- Visit Charge: $40
- Labor Charge: $78.75
- Parts Charge: $60

Total charge:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged **$178.75** for the job.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD costs $15. So, if we multiply the number of CDs by the cost of each CD, we get:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, James gets a 40% discount on these CDs. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 40% of $150. We can do this by multiplying 150 by 0.40:
\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much James actually paid:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he gets $40 back. To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money James was out is:
50"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops.

First, we need to find out how much she will earn from the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.5.
- So, 6 yams * $1.5 each = $9.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.
- So, 10 sweet potatoes * $2 each = $20.

Now, let's find out how much she will earn from the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- So, 4 carrots * $1.25 each = $5.

Finally, we add up all the earnings:
- Earnings from yams: $9
- Earnings from sweet potatoes: $20
- Earnings from carrots: $5
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how far James swims at the start:**
   - The lake is 20 miles long.
   - James swims 60% of the lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Next, we figure out how long it takes him to swim those 12 miles:**
   - James swims at 2 miles per hour.
   - To swim 12 miles, it takes \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Then, James takes a rest:**
   - He rests for half the time he swam.
   - Half of 6 hours is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) hours.

4. **Now, we need to find out how far he has left to swim:**
   - He has already swum 12 miles.
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - So, he has \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles left to swim.

5. **James swims the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed:**
   - His original speed was 2 miles per hour.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) mile per hour.
   - To swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour, it takes \( 8 \div 1 = 8 \) hours.

6. **Finally, we add up all the time:**
   - Time to swim the first 12 miles: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours
   - Time to swim the last 8 miles: 8 hours
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours

So, it took James **17 hours** to get across the lake."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much money Cayley makes from selling the New York Times. Each New York Times paper costs $5, and Cayley gets 10% of that as a commission. So, for each paper, he gets:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's look at the Wall Street Journal. Each Wall Street Journal costs $15, and Cayley gets 8% of that as a commission. So, for each paper, he gets:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission Cayley earns:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cayley will earn a total commission of:

2. Bahati scored the most points, and he scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many points each person scored.

First, let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points. Then:
- Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Now, we need to find \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

- 1 inch = 100 pages
- The book is 1.5 inches thick

To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:
\[ 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages.

First, we need to figure out how long Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's a long time! Let's count the hours:

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, we need to change these hours into minutes because we know how many reports Vince can staple in minutes. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so:

- 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

- 900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Finally, if Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find out how many reports he stapled in total by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

- 60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours is the same as 8 times 60 minutes, which equals 480 minutes.

2. **Time Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - To find out how long she was sleepwalking, we need to count the minutes from 2:15 to 2:38.
   - From 2:15 to 2:38 is 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Time Lost:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time lost = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.

Next, we're told that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we need to find 2/3 of 24:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract 6 from the 16 measuring spoons:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons left} \]

Finally, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left:
\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, the hospital has 1000 beds. Right now, 1 out of every 5 beds is being used. So, we need to find out how many beds that is:
\[ 1000 \div 5 = 200 \]
So, 200 beds are already being used.

Next, every day, 50 more people come to the hospital. We need to know how many days are in 2 weeks:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]
So, there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

Now, if 50 people come each day for 14 days, we need to find out how many people that is in total:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]
So, 700 more people will come to the hospital in 2 weeks.

Now, we add the 700 new people to the 200 people already there:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]
So, 900 beds will be used after 2 weeks.

Finally, to find out how many beds are still empty, we subtract the number of used beds from the total number of beds:

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there really were.

To find out how many people really attended, we need to figure out what 20% of the real number is and then add that to the real number to get 48.

Let's call the real number of people \( x \).

If \( x \) is the real number, then 20% more than \( x \) is \( x + 0.2x \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 0.2x = 48 \]

This is the same as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

Now, to find \( x \), we need to divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

If we do the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

- Jordan picked up twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan picked up 2 * 2 = 4 balls.
- Jason picked up twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey picked up 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they picked up:
- Jordan: 4 balls

2. **Second Day:**
   - They dug 13 more holes.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes because the pirates kept falling in.
   - So, the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

4. **Total Holes by the End of the Third Day:**
   - First day: 10 holes

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Total Pokemon Caught:**
   Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together caught 339 Pokemon.

2. **Alex's Pokemon:**
   Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan. So if Stan caught \( S \) Pokemon, Alex caught \( S + 5 \) Pokemon.

3. **Stan's Pokemon:**
   Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe. If Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon, then Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

4. **Equation for Total Pokemon:**
   We know the total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339. So we can write:
   \[
   A + S + (S + 5) = 339
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   A + 2S + 5 = 339
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   A + 2S = 334
   \]

5. **Substitute Stan's Pokemon:**
   We know \( S = 4A - 13 \). Let's substitute this into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
   \[
   A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   A + 8A - 26 = 334
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   9A - 26 = 334
   \]
   Add 26 to both sides:
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
   Divide by 9:
   \[
   A = 40
   \]

6. **Find Stan's Pokemon:**
   Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]
   Substitute \( A = 40 \):
   \[
   S = 4(40) - 13
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   S = 160 - 13

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far it went, we multiply the time by the speed:
   - 10 hours × 30 miles/hour = 300 miles south.

2. Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Again, we multiply the time by the speed:
   - 2 hours × 18 miles/hour = 36 miles north.

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We do the same thing:
   - 5 hours × 22 miles/hour = 110 miles south.

Now, we need to figure out the total distance the bird traveled south. We add the distances it flew south and subtract the distance it flew north:
- Total south: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.
- Total north: 36 miles.

So, the net distance south is:
- 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is 12, she made 12 brownies.
2. Her office gave her half a dozen brownies. Half of 12 is 6, so she got 6 more brownies.
3. Her friends at the surprise party brought 4 dozen brownies. Four times 12 is 48, so they brought 48 brownies.
4. During the party, 1 and a half dozen brownies were eaten. One and a half dozen is 18, so 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had:
- 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the party) = 66 brownies.

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so that means his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find out how much younger, we need to calculate 25% of 8. That's 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three, we add their ages together:
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes to string each type of racquet:

- For the racquets with synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes each. There are 3 of these, so:
  \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

- For the racquets with polyester string, it takes 22 minutes each. There are 5 of these, so:
  \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

- For the racquets with the hybrid set, it takes 18 minutes each. There are 4 of these, so:
  \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
\( 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \) minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

John is buying phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. That's 4 phones in total. Each phone costs $600, but after the first two phones, the next ones are half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 ÷ 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost: $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we need to add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.

13 + 7 = 20

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find out how many players are on both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

13 + 20 = 33

So, there are 33 players in both teams combined.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we need to find out how long the fence will be all the way around. This is called the perimeter. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we add up all the sides. 

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. So, we have two sides that are 15 feet each and two sides that are 10 feet each. 

Let's add them up:
15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50 feet

So, the fence will be 50 feet long all the way around.

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we need to multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he needs.

50 feet × 2 slats per foot = 100 slats

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. That's a lot of oranges!

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away:
2 + 2 = 4 boxes

Now, we need to find out how many boxes she has left:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Next, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is, we do:
1/4 of 8 = 2 boxes

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The rest of the boxes are:
8 - 2 = 6 boxes

Each box has 20 oranges, so the number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we need to know how many states are in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Now, we need to find out how many states India has. The question says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

Half of 50 is 25. So, if India has 4 more than 25, that means India has 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries together:
- USA: 50 states
- India: 29 states

So, 50 + 29 = 79 states in total.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much all the books cost together. The dictionary is $18, the dinosaur book is $13, and the cookbook is $8. So, we add these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the books cost $39 in total.

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract what he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books.

Tyler earns $5 for each hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work to get $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to get enough money for the books.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, if we take away 10 cherries from Robert's 30, we find out how many cherries Richard has:
   - 30 - 10 = 20 cherries for Richard.
3. Now, we know Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries. Together, they have:
   - 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.
4. The total number of cherries is 60. So, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total:
   - 60 - 50 = 10 cherries for Jerry.
5. Finally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
   - 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Sunny made from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the weekend.

**Saturday:**
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up all the boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we need to find out how much money he made from each type of item:
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box, so for 25 boxes, he made 25 * 6 = $150.
- Apple pie costs $15 per box, so for 21 boxes, he made 21 * 15 = $315.

Finally, we add the money from both items to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

1. **How much sunscreen does Pamela use each day?**
   - She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - So, she uses 1 ounce/hour × 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day.

2. **How much sunscreen does she use over 8 days?**
   - She uses 4 ounces each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - So, she uses 4 ounces/day × 8 days = 32 ounces.

3. **How many bottles of sunscreen does she need?**
   - Each bottle has 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - So, she needs 32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 

First, we need to find out what 40% of $100 is:
40% of $100 = 40/100 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. 

Now, we subtract $40 from $100 to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

The red car costs $60.

To find out how much both cars cost together, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
$100 + $60 = $160

So, both cars together cost $160.

1. **Emil's Age Now:**
   - Emil is 19 years old right now.

2. **Emil's Age in 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 19 + 5 = 24 years old.

3. **Dad's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

4. **Dad's Age Now:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, he is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

5. **Brother's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, Emil's brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

6. **Brother's Age Now:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, he is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

7. **Sum of Dad's and Brother's Ages Now:**
   - Dad's age now is 43.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. That's like having 3 big bags of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   On Friday, Joe caught 4 times as much as he did on Thursday. So, if he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, on Friday he caught:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   That's like having 12 big bags of crawfish!

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   On Saturday, Joe caught half of what he caught on Friday. So, if he caught 12 pounds on Friday, on Saturday he caught:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   That's like having 6 big bags of crawfish.

4. **Total Catch:**
   Now, let's add up all the crawfish Joe caught over the three days:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know there are 30 students in Mr. Roper's class. Now, 20% of these students are football players. To find out how many that is, we can do a simple calculation:

20% of 30 is the same as 20 out of 100, which is 20/100. So, we multiply 30 by 20/100:
30 * 20/100 = 6 students

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
30 - 6 = 24 students

Now, out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find 25% of 24, we do another simple calculation:
25% of 24 is the same as 25 out of 100, which is 25/100. So, we multiply 24 by 25/100:
24 * 25/100 = 6 students

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

So, 12 students are leaving early.

1. **First, we need to know how much space each flower and the space between them take up:**
   - Each flower is 1 foot wide.
   - Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet of space between each flower.
   - So, each flower and the space next to it take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how many flowers can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each flower and the space next to it take up.
   - 111 ÷ 2.5 = 44.4
   - Since we can't have a part of a flower, we round down to 44 flowers.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many more flowers Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already has 17 flowers.
   - She needs 44 flowers in total.
   - So, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

4. **Finally, we need to calculate how much money Pat will spend:**
   - Each flower costs $6.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of flowers she needs to buy by the cost of each flower.

- She wants 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.

Next, we need to find out how much each type of plant costs:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- For the petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- For the sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is:
- $9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (vines) = $14.00

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, so we need to multiply the cost of one basket by 5:

First, we have a big bag of soil that weighs 30 pounds. We need to use this soil to plant some flowers.

1. **Sunflowers**: Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - So, for the sunflowers: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds of soil.

2. **Carnations**: Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. They plant 10 carnations.
   - So, for the carnations: \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) pounds of soil.

Now, let's add up the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used: \( 12 + 15 = 27 \) pounds.

We started with 30 pounds of soil, so the soil left for the roses is:
- Soil left: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, with 3 pounds of soil left, we can plant:
- Number of roses: \( 3 \div 1 = 3 \) roses.

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Jessica makes $2,000 every month. She saves 25% of her money to buy fancy shoes. 

First, we need to find out how much 25% of $2,000 is. We can do this by multiplying $2,000 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%).

$2,000 × 0.25 = $500

So, Jessica saves $500 each month for shoes.

Now, let's see how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500 by 12.

$500 × 12 = $6,000

Jessica saves $6,000 in a year for shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of one pair of shoes.

$6,000 ÷ $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. If she can peel 6 shrimp in one minute, we can find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp by dividing 90 by 6.

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel all the shrimp.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. If she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp by dividing 90 by 30.

90 ÷ 30 = 3 sets

Since each set takes 10 minutes to cook, we multiply 3 sets by 10 minutes.

3 × 10 = 30 minutes

So, it takes her 30 minutes to cook all the shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp to find the total time.

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

1. **First, the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours.**
   - On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Next, the air conditioner is turned up to high for 4 hours.**
   - On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Then, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.**
   - When it's off, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- The room cooled down by 6 degrees on low.
- The room cooled down by 12 degrees on high.
- The room warmed up by 4 degrees when the air conditioner was off.

So, the total cooling is \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.

   - So, we know that Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet.

2. **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw the comet.**
   - If Bill's dad was 30, then three times that age is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
   - So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **The comet comes back every 75 years.**
   - This means that 75 years passed between the first time Bill saw the comet and the second time he saw it.

4. **To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - We need to subtract 75 years from 90 years.

2. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month. So, he writes another 12 checks for the gas bill.
3. Buford writes a check to the church twice a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks for the church.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months (which is called a quarter). There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's add all these checks together:
- Electric bill checks: 12

2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. So, if it makes 4 trips, 3 of them would be to Greece.
3. The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, if the first plane makes 4 trips, 1 trip would be to France and 1 trip would be to Germany.
4. The second plane only goes to Poland and makes 44 trips. These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane must make twice as many trips as the second plane.
5. If the second plane makes 44 trips, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.
6. Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Three-quarters of these trips are to Greece, so:
   - 3/4 of 88 = 66 trips to Greece.
7. The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining trips are:
   - 88 - 66 = 22 trips.
8. Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, each gets:

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - So, Chikote howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - So, Igneous howls for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Time:**
   - Now, we add up all the howl times:
   - Tobias: 20 seconds
   - Chikote: 40 seconds
   - Igneous: 60 seconds
   - Total: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, 120 seconds is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Adam bought new trousers for $30. His mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him twice as much as his mom. So, his dad gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money his mom and dad gave him:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, Adam got $18 from his parents. The trousers cost $30, so we need to find out how much more Adam had to pay from his own savings:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have four friends: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know a few things:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of all four friends is 20 years.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's find out the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Total of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7 years

Now, we know the total age of all four friends is 20 years. So, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred must be:
- Total age of Helene and Wilfred: 20 - 7 = 13 years

Next, we need to figure out Helene's age. We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
- Average age = Total age of the group / Number of friends
- Average age = 20 / 4 = 5 years

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
- Helene's age = 2 * 5 = 10 years

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
- Wilfred's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, Walter collects money from his neighbors. He gets $500. Then, he sets up a fund online and collects $1500 more. So, the total amount he has collected so far is:
$500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, his friend gives him $200. So, we add that to the total:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, Walter's lawyer says he will donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. So, we need to multiply the total amount collected by 3:
$2200 × 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we know there were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, to find out how many cookies there were in total, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought:
\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]
So, there were 1500 cookies in total.

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. To find out how many cookies that is, we divide the total number of cookies by 2:
\[ 1500 \div 2 = 750 \]
So, 750 cookies were given to the church.

Now, we need to find out how many people in the church got these cookies. We know each person got 15 cookies. To find out how many people that is, we divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:
\[ 750 \div 15 = 50 \]

So, 50 people in the church got the cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're sharing a big yummy watermelon!

Imagine we have 6 people: 2 grown-ups and 4 kids. The grown-ups want bigger slices, so each grown-up gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets 1 piece of the watermelon. Then each grown-up gets 2 pieces because it's twice as big.

So, we have:
- 4 kids, each getting 1 piece: 4 pieces
- 2 grown-ups, each getting 2 pieces: 4 pieces

In total, we have 8 pieces of watermelon.

Now, we want to know what part of the whole watermelon each grown-up gets. Each grown-up gets 2 pieces out of the 8 pieces.

To find out what part of the watermelon that is, we can use a simple fraction:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pieces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each grown-up gets 25% of the watermelon.

1. Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours. That's like 9 big slices of a pie.
2. He has to check on 9 inpatients, and each check takes 20 minutes. So, 9 checks times 20 minutes each is 180 minutes. That's 3 hours because 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours (60 minutes in an hour).
3. He also has 10 appointments, and each one takes 30 minutes. So, 10 appointments times 30 minutes each is 300 minutes. That's 5 hours because 300 minutes is the same as 5 hours.
4. Now, let's add the time for the checks and the appointments: 3 hours for checks + 5 hours for appointments = 8 hours.
5. Doctor Jones has 9 hours in total, so if he spends 8 hours on checks and appointments, he has 1 hour left to update his records.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

Jordan wants to make a yummy birthday cake for her mom. She needs to do a few things:

1. **Make the cake batter:** This takes 20 minutes.
2. **Bake the cake:** This takes 30 minutes.
3. **Cool the cake:** This takes 2 hours.
4. **Frost the cake:** This takes 10 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time Jordan needs:

- 20 minutes for the batter
- 30 minutes for baking
- 2 hours for cooling
- 10 minutes for frosting

First, let's add the minutes:
20 + 30 + 10 = 60 minutes

60 minutes is the same as 1 hour. So, we have:
1 hour (from the minutes) + 2 hours (for cooling) = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours in total to make the cake.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start 3 hours before that. So, we count back 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

First, let's add up how many boxes they sold in total:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

So, together they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we know that 8 boxes of chocolate bars equal 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. First, we need to find out how much it costs to rent the studio for one session. The studio costs $25 to rent for one session.
2. Then, we need to add the cost for the students. Each student costs $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students. So, we multiply $1.50 by 10 students, which gives us $15.
3. Now, we add the cost to rent the studio and the cost for the students for one session. That's $25 + $15, which equals $40.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week. So, we multiply the cost of one session by 3, which gives us $40 * 3 = $120.
5. Finally, we need to find out how much it costs in a month. We assume a month has 4 weeks. So, we multiply the weekly cost by 4, which gives us $120 * 4 = $480.

So, the expected cost for the dance studio in a month is $480.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, let's do the same for Martha. Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. We divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's boxes from the number in Peter's boxes:

\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. The problem says that 3 out of every 5 porcupines are female. So, if there are 50 porcupines in total, we can find the number of female porcupines by doing:
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many babies these female porcupines will have. Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month. So, if there are 30 female porcupines, the number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many babies are born in a whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of babies born in a year to the original number of porcupines to get the total number of porcupines after a year:
   \[
   \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

\[ 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water this is. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The pool company charges $0.10 for each gallon of water. So, we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10:

Now, let's see how far Shandy went. Shandy was driving at 45 miles every hour, and she drove for 10 hours. So, we do 45 miles times 10 hours, which is 450 miles. That means Shandy went 450 miles.

To find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the miles Matteo drove from the miles Shandy drove. So, 450 miles minus 220 miles equals 230 miles.

So, Shandy drove 230 miles more than Matteo.

1. **What we know at the end:**
   - After 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours), the power bank had 28% charge left.

2. **What happened in the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if we go back 3 hours, the power bank had more charge.
   - We need to find out how much more.

3. **Calculate the charge before the last 3 hours:**
   - If the power bank had 28% after losing 7% each hour for 3 hours, we can work backwards.
   - Each hour, the power bank had \(\frac{100\%}{93\%}\) of the charge it had at the end of that hour.
   - So, before the last 3 hours, the power bank had:
     \[
     28\% \times \frac{100}{93} \times \frac{100}{93} \times \frac{100}{93}
     \]
   - Let's do the math:
     \[
     28 \times \frac{100}{93} \approx 30.11\%
     \]
     \[
     30.11 \times \frac{100}{93} \approx 32.38\%

4. **What happened in the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour.
   - So, if we go back 5 hours, the power bank had more charge.
   - We need to find out how much more.

5. **Calculate the charge before the first 5 hours:**
   - If the power bank had 34.82% after losing 9% each hour for 5 hours, we can work backwards.
   - Each hour, the power bank had \(\frac{100\%}{91\%}\) of the charge it had at the end of that hour.
   - So, before the first 5 hours, the power bank had:
     \[
     34.82\% \times \frac{100}{91} \times \frac{100}{91} \times \frac{100}{91} \times \frac{100}{91} \times \frac{100}{91}

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. He's already bought some fruits, so we need to figure out how much money he has left to buy plums.

First, let's add up the cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these amounts together to find out how much he has spent:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so we subtract the amount he has spent:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Anne decided to keep 2 packs for herself. So, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. We do this by subtracting the 2 packs she kept from the 15 packs she had:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \]

So, Anne gave away 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in those 13 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces in each pack:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \]

So, Anne gave away 780 pieces of sweets.

Now, Anne has 10 friends, and she wants to give the sweets equally to each friend. To find out how many pieces each friend gets, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The price of carrots starts at $120.
2. Every year, the price goes up by 5%. This means we add 5% of the current price to the current price each year.

Let's do the math for each year:

**Year 1:**
- 5% of $120 is \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \)
- New price after Year 1: \( 120 + 6 = 126 \)

**Year 2:**
- 5% of $126 is \( 126 \times 0.05 = 6.30 \)
- New price after Year 2: \( 126 + 6.30 = 132.30 \)

**Year 3:**
- 5% of $132.30 is \( 132.30 \times 0.05 = 6.615 \)
- New price after Year 3: \( 132.30 + 6.615 = 138.915 \)

Now, we need to round 138.915 to the nearest whole number. The number 138.915 is closer to 139 than to 138, so we round it up to 139.

So, the price of carrots after three years will be:

3. Now, we know that 3 of these albums are full of selfies, and 2 albums are full of portraits. We need to find out how many selfies and portraits there are in total.

4. For the selfies:
   - 3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

5. For the portraits:
   - 2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

2. 24 guests left early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \( 100 - 24 = 76 \)
3. Then, 15 guests left late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \( 76 - 15 = 61 \)
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who left late. Since 15 guests left late, twice that number is:
   \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \)
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \( 61 + 30 = 91 \)
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to 91:
   \( 91 + 7 = 98 \)

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"Okay, let's count the bananas John picked!

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked 3 times as many bananas as he did on Wednesday, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 bananas.

Now, let's add them all up:
4 bananas on Wednesday + 6 bananas on Thursday + 12 bananas on Friday = 22 bananas.

So, John has 22 bananas in total!"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how many easy questions there are:**
   - There are 60 questions in total.
   - 40% of these questions are easy.
   - To find 40% of 60, we do: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
   - So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many average and difficult questions there are:**
   - The rest of the questions are not easy, so we subtract the easy questions from the total:
     - \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - These 36 questions are split equally between average and difficult questions.
   - So, there are \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) average questions and 18 difficult questions.

3. **Now, let's see how many questions Aries can get right:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right.
     - To find 75% of 24, we do: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
     - So, Aries gets 18 easy questions right.
   - Aries gets half of the average questions right.
     - Half of 18 is: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
     - So, Aries gets 9 average questions right.
   - Aries also gets half of the difficult questions right.
     - Half of 18 is: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
     - So, Aries gets 9 difficult questions right.

4. **Finally, we add up all the questions Aries gets right:**
   - Easy questions: 18
   - Average questions: 9
   - Difficult questions: 9
   - Total questions right: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

So, Aries is sure to get 36 questions right.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
3. She earned $120 in total from selling both small and large stuffed animals.
4. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so a large one costs $12 (because 3 times 4 is 12).

Now, let's use some simple math to figure out how many small stuffed animals she sold.

- Let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals.
- Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals (because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

The total money she made from selling the small stuffed animals is:
\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \]

The total money she made from selling the large stuffed animals is:
\[ 12 \times x = 12x \]

So, the total money she made from both is:
\[ 8x + 12x = 20x \]

We know she made $120 in total, so:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school!

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches the whole family eats in one day. 

- The man eats 5 sandwiches.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches.

So, if we add these up:
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches in one day.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7:

11 sandwiches/day × 7 days = 77 sandwiches in one week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

- She sold 80 cookies for $1 each. So, 80 cookies times $1 equals $80.
- She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, 60 cupcakes times $4 equals $240.

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes together:
- $80 + $240 = $320

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters:
- She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so $10 times 2 equals $20.

Finally, we subtract the $20 from the total money she made:
- $320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs.
2. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. So, together they found:
   \[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]
3. There were 10 eggs that no one found.
4. To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs:
   \[ 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to know how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 12 pounds times 2, which is 24 pounds.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is 12 pounds (because 24 divided by 2 is 12).
   - Adding that to 24 pounds, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore with a steel pickaxe in one day.

2. Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes.
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds, then 40 dwarves can mine 40 times 36 pounds.
   - 40 times 36 is 1440 pounds of ore in one day.

3. Finally, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days.
   - If they can mine 1440 pounds in one day, then in 30 days, they can mine 1440 times 30.
   - 1440 times 30 is 43200 pounds of ore.

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. We have three different packages of sandwiches, and we need to find out how much the biggest package costs.

First, let's look at what we know:
- A package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- A package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.

Now, let's figure out how much each sandwich costs in these packages:
- For the package with 2 sandwiches: $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the package with 4 sandwiches: $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

So, each sandwich costs $1.50 no matter how many are in the package.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 sandwiches would cost:
- If 1 sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches would cost 8 × $1.50 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Tom bought a new bedroom set for $3000. He sold his old bedroom set and got $1000. So, he used that $1000 to pay part of the new set. 

Now, we need to find out how much he still owes:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Tom still owes $2000. He has to pay 10% of this amount each month. To find 10% of $2000, we do:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. A gust of wind made 40% of the red balloons burst. To find out how many burst, we do:
   \[
   25 \times 0.40 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 red balloons burst, and she has:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons left}
   \]

3. The loud noise scared Sally, and she let go of half of her yellow balloons. To find out how many she let go, we do:
   \[
   12 \times 0.50 = 6
   \]
   So, she let go of 6 yellow balloons, and she has:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons left}
   \]

4. Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons in a tree. She added 75% of them to her balloons. To find out how many she added, we do:
   \[
   8 \times 0.75 = 6
   \]
   So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

5. Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
   - Red balloons: 15

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in.

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher comes (which is the other 50% chance), there are two more things to consider:
     - There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. So, 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 40% (chance of extension) equals 20%.
     - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (which is 60% of the time), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework. So, 50% (chance of normal teacher) times 60% (no extension) times 20% (dog ate it) equals 6%.

3. **Adding It All Up:**
   - The total chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is:
     - 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher gives extension) + 6% (dog ate it) = 76%.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - If there's a 76% chance he won't have to turn in his homework, then there's a 100% - 76% = 24% chance he will have to turn it in.

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

1. First, we need to find out how many seats are left for the friends and family after giving seats to the graduates and the teachers.
   - The Fine Arts Center has 6000 seats in total.
   - 950 seats are for the graduates.
   - 300 seats are for the teachers.
   - So, we subtract the seats for graduates and teachers from the total seats:
     \[
     6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

   - This means there are 4750 seats left for friends and family.

2. Now, we need to figure out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family. We do this by dividing the number of seats left by the number of graduates:
   \[
   \frac{4750}{950} = 5

3. **Total Expenses:**
   - Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day.
   - She parks for 3 days.
   - So, her total expenses are:

   - Richard will use 8 soda bottles.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Richard to move between the bottles.**
   - It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - He has to move from the 1st bottle to the 2nd, then from the 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, until he reaches the 8th bottle.
   - He moves 7 times (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and 7 to 8).

   - So, the total money he borrowed is \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **How much money did Jim lose by not working during college?**
   - Before college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 each year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years while in college.
   - So, the total money he lost is \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **How much money does Jim need to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income?**
   - The total amount he needs to earn is \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to know how big the bed is. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. 

Now, Jim wants the fabric to be a bit bigger than the bed. He wants it to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. So, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

For the length:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

For the width:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

So, each piece of fabric needs to be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

Next, we need to find out how much fabric one piece covers. We do this by multiplying the length by the width:
8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

   - Twice what he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Now, we need to solve for x. First, subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets $420.

The share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **How many days did they work?**
   - They worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **How much of a day did they work each day?**
   - They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **How many hours is 3/8 of a day?**
   - A whole day has 24 hours.
   - So, 3/8 of 24 hours = (3 * 24) / 8 = 72 / 8 = 9 hours.

4. **How many hours did the team work in total?**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

5. **How many hours did each painter work?**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

Each painter worked 47.25 hours."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Rory picked up tennis balls after a match. He picked up different numbers of balls in each of the three sets. Here's what we know:

1. In the first set, he picked up 4 more balls than in the second set.
2. In the third set, he picked up half as many balls as in the second set.
3. In total, he picked up 19 balls.

Let's use a simple letter to help us, like ""x."" We'll say ""x"" is the number of balls Rory picked up in the second set.

- In the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, he picked up \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

Now, we add all these up to get the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:
\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory picked up 6 balls. Now, we can find out how many he picked up in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. Every year, the car loses 21% of its value. We need to find out how much the car is worth in 2010, which is 3 years later.

1. First, we need to figure out how much the car loses in value each year. If the car is worth $20,000, and it loses 21% each year, we can find 21% of $20,000:
   \[
   21\% \text{ of } 20000 = \frac{21}{100} \times 20000 = 0.21 \times 20000 = 4200
   \]
   So, the car loses $4,200 in value each year.

2. Now, we need to find out how much the car is worth after 3 years. Each year, the car's value is reduced by $4,200. So, after 3 years, the total loss in value is:
   \[
   4200 \times 3 = 12600
   \]

3. Finally, we subtract the total loss from the original price to find the car's value in 2010:
   \[
   20000 - 12600 = 7400
   \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $7,400.

7400"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. There are 50 books in total.
2. Half of them are in English, so that's 50 divided by 2, which equals 25 books.
3. 10% of the books are in German. 10% of 50 is 5 books.
4. Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we need to subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

So, 50 books - 25 English books - 5 German books = 20 Spanish books.

The number of Spanish books is 20."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

Bernice is on a big trip from San Diego to New York City. The whole trip is about 1955 kilometers long. That's a really long way!

Now, Bernice has been driving for 4 days, and each day she drove 325 kilometers. To find out how far she has driven, we need to do some multiplication:

325 kilometers/day × 4 days = 1300 kilometers

So, Bernice has driven 1300 kilometers so far. But we need to know how many kilometers she still has to go. To find that out, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers to reach New York City.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how much water she drinks in 30 days.

First, we figure out how many cups she drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert these cups into gallons. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

1. First, Romeo gets on the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people get on. So, we add 20 to 120:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off, and twice as many (which is 100) get on. So, we subtract 50 and then add 100:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off. So, we subtract 80 from 190:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear step by step:

1. **Tank top**: Alison bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. So, $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on her athletic gear."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many tiles we need. Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, so it covers 1 square foot. The kitchen floor is 200 square feet. So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Next, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each tile costs $12. So, if we need 200 tiles, we multiply 200 by 12.

200 tiles × $12 per tile = $2400

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor.

James has to pay more for his insurance because he had an accident. The normal cost is $120 a month. But now, he has to pay 60% more.

First, we need to find out what 60% of $120 is. We do this by multiplying 120 by 0.60:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the extra amount he has to pay each month is $72.

Now, we add this extra amount to the normal cost to find out the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

James now pays $192 each month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

Greg has to put clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed every week. His washing machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

First, let's figure out how many times he needs to use the washing machine each week:

- For the 4 twin beds: Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he needs to do 4 ÷ 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.
- For the 1 king-size bed: The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so he needs to do 1 load for the king-size bed.

So, each week, Greg does 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king-size bed = 3 loads in total.

Now, let's find out how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

3 loads per week × 52 weeks = 156 loads in a year.

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

   - Half of 4 is 2, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

3. **Total movies in one weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies in 4 weeks:**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies per weekend × 4 weekends = 24 movies.

So, in 4 weeks, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much food all the cats eat in one feeding. Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food per feeding. So, we multiply 60 grams by 3 cats:
60 grams × 3 = 180 grams

This means all the cats together eat 180 grams of food in one feeding.

Next, we need to know how much food they eat in one whole day. Since they are fed twice a day, we multiply the amount they eat in one feeding by 2:
180 grams × 2 = 360 grams

So, all the cats together eat 360 grams of food in one day.

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount they eat in one day:
720 grams ÷ 360 grams/day = 2 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy took 18 minutes more than Donovan. The whole meal took 98 minutes.

First, let's say Donovan took \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

Together, they took 98 minutes, so we can write:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's add the \( D \)s together:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to get \( D \) by itself. We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( D \):
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 18 minutes more than Donovan:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Hannah's doctor visit costs.

1. The cast costs $200.
2. The doctor visits for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300 for each hour, so for half an hour, it's $300 divided by 2, which is $150.
3. Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each one costs $4. So, 30 times $4 is $120.
4. The parking costs $6 for each hour, and she has to park for at least 2 hours. So, 2 times $6 is $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
- Cast: $200
- Visit: $150
- Painkillers: $120
- Parking: $12

$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

James gets 80 emails every day. But not all of them need a reply. Only 80 out of every 100 emails need a reply, because 20 out of every 100 don't need one.

So, to find out how many emails need a reply, we can do this:
\[ 80 \times \frac{80}{100} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64 \]

This means James replies to 64 emails each day.

Now, if he works 5 days a week, we need to find out how many emails he replies to in a whole week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he replies to each day by the number of days he works:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James replies to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, the glee club ordered 20 pizzas. They ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we can do this:
- 70% of 20 is the same as 70 out of 100, so we can say 70/100 * 20.
- 70/100 is the same as 0.7, so we do 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.
- So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas.

Now, to find out how many pizzas the glee club has left:
- They started with 20 pizzas and ate 14, so 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. So:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas, so the football team ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
- The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. To find out how many they ate, we do:
- 80% of 40 is the same as 80 out of 100, so we can say 80/100 * 40.
- 80/100 is the same as 0.8, so we do 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.
- So, the football team ate 32 pizzas.

Now, to find out how many pizzas the football team has left:
- They started with 40 pizzas and ate 32, so 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Finally, to find out the total number of pizzas left:
- The glee club has 6 pizzas left, and the football team has 8 pizzas left.
- So, 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left in total.

\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much it costs to mail all these coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

Now, we add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons together:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:

- 20 ÷ 4 = 5 trucks had problems.

Now, we need to find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser:
- Total trucks sent out: 20
- Trucks with problems: 5
- Trucks that delivered: 20 - 5 = 15 trucks

Each of these 15 trucks delivered 20 tons of fertiliser. So, we need to find out the total amount of fertiliser delivered:

   - So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

2. **Now, let's look at the store's promotion:**
   - The store has a deal: ""Buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter you buy at full price, you get the next pound at half price.

3. **Let's figure out the cost:**
   - The full price of one pound of butter is $4.00.
   - For the first pound, Dennis pays $4.00.
   - For the second pound, he pays half of $4.00, which is $2.00.
   - For the third pound, he pays $4.00 again.
   - For the fourth pound, he pays $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, he pays $2.00.

2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas every day. So, in one week, the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}

1. He finished half of a 500-piece puzzle.
2. He finished a whole 500-piece puzzle.

First, half of 500 is 250. So, Teddy put together 250 pieces from the first puzzle.

Then, he put together all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

Now, we add the pieces from both puzzles:
250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

So, Teddy put together 750 pieces during that hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **Find out how much 15 roses cost:**
   - A dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses plus 3 more roses.
   - The 12 roses cost $15.
   - Each extra rose costs $2, so 3 roses cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Calculate how much money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has 5 five-dollar bills.
   - Each five-dollar bill is worth $5, so 5 bills are worth \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Find out how much change Jenny gets:**
   - Jenny spent $21 on the roses.
   - She had $25, so her change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - One dollar is equal to 4 quarters.
   - So, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Terry made by selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, we need to find out how much he made from the milkshakes:
- He sold 6 milkshakes.
- Each milkshake costs $5.50.
- So, 6 milkshakes times $5.50 each is 6 × 5.50 = $33.00.

Next, let's calculate the money from the burger platters:
- He sold 9 burger platters.
- Each burger platter costs $11.
- So, 9 burger platters times $11 each is 9 × 11 = $99.00.

Now, let's find out how much he made from the sodas:
- He sold 20 sodas.
- Each soda costs $1.50.
- So, 20 sodas times $1.50 each is 20 × 1.50 = $30.00.

Finally, we add up all the money he made:
- Money from milkshakes: $33.00
- Money from burger platters: $99.00
- Money from sodas: $30.00
- Total money: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, Terry made a total of $162.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train comes in 10 minutes.
   - It stays for 20 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train comes at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train comes an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train comes at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - It leaves right away, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train comes at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for 145 minutes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks, and she saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, we need to find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far. We do this by multiplying the number of weeks by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ 12 \text{ weeks} \times 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total for her sculpture. We need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs. We do this by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save 80 more toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ 80 \text{ toothpicks} \div 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

1. **First, we find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The watch originally costs $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - To find 75% of $2000, we multiply 2000 by 0.75.
   - \( 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \)
   - So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. **Next, we find out how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
   - To find 120% of $1500, we multiply 1500 by 1.20.
   - \( 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \)
   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

3. **Now, we find out how much of a discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid.
   - \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \)
   - So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a discount of $200.

4. **Finally, we find out what percentage this discount is of the original price:**
   - To find the percentage, we divide the discount by the original price and then multiply by 100.
   - \( \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \)
   - So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

1. First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. We know:
   - 1 hour has 60 minutes.
   - 1 minute has 60 seconds.
   - So, 1 hour has 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds.
   - Therefore, 4 hours have 4 x 3600 = 14400 seconds.

2. Now, if one spring makes 1 jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, it will make 14400 jellyfish.

3. If we have 5 springs, and each spring makes 14400 jellyfish, then all 5 springs together will make:
   - 5 x 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

So, the answer is 72000 jellyfish!

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. James starts walking to the store, which is 4 miles away.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. Then he realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So he walks another 2 miles back home.
4. Now, he has to walk the full 4 miles to the store again.

So, let's add up all the miles he walked:
- 2 miles to the halfway point
- 2 miles back home
- 4 miles to the store

That's a total of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed:
- 8 miles ÷ 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas. Each bunch has 4 bananas, so she got:
10 bunches × 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

If she bought each banana separately, each banana costs $0.80. So, for 40 bananas, she would pay:
40 bananas × $0.80 per banana = $32.00

But Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. So, for 10 bunches, she paid:
10 bunches × $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Now, let's see how much money Jenny saved:
$32.00 (cost of buying individually) - $30.00 (cost of buying in bunches) = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches.

The answer is: $2.00"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to share. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. We need to find out how much fence Sam gets.

First, let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.

Now, we know the total fence is 100 feet, so:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This means:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Total Bikes Sold**: Marcel sold 300 bikes in one month.

2. **Trekking Bikes**:
   - Half of the bikes were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

3. **BMX Bikes**:
   - 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes.
   - So, \( 15\% \) of 300 is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

4. **MTB Bikes**:
   - The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes.
   - So, \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

5. **Prices**:
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: Half the price of an MTB, so \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Trekking: $450

6. **Earnings**:
   - From MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
   - From BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
   - From Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

7. **Total Earnings**:
   - Add up all the earnings: \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes in one day. The farmer makes 5 bales every hour. If the farmer works for 6 hours, we can find the total number of bales made by multiplying:

5 bales/hour × 6 hours = 30 bales

Next, we need to figure out how many bales the truck picks up in one day. The truck picks up 3 bales every hour. If the truck works for 6 hours, we can find the total number of bales picked up by multiplying:

3 bales/hour × 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many classes John has in a week. He has 6 classes each day, plus 2 extra classes. So, each day he has:

6 + 2 = 8 classes

He goes to school 5 days a week, so the total number of classes in a week is:

8 classes/day × 5 days/week = 40 classes/week

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

40 classes/week × 40 minutes/class = 1600 minutes/week

Now, John also spends some extra time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days. So, the extra time on each day is:

1600 minutes/week ÷ 16 = 100 minutes/day

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time for the weekend is:

100 minutes/day × 2 days = 200 minutes

Adding the extra weekend time to the regular class time gives us the total time John spends learning each week:

1600 minutes/week + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes/week

To find out how many hours this is, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1800 minutes ÷ 60 = 30 hours

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

1. **First, we need to know how high the ball is dropped from:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third floor of the mall.
   - Each floor is 24 feet high.
   - So, the ball is dropped from \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet high.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height.
   - So, after the first bounce, the ball goes up to \( 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \) feet.

3. **Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its height after the first bounce.
   - So, after the second bounce, the ball goes up to \( 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \) feet.

So, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.

Next, we need to find out how much money they made. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if the triceratops had \( x \) kilograms of meat, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, and there was \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms left.

2. Then, the velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( \frac{x}{2} \), which is \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means there was \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms left after the velociraptors.

3. Finally, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. So, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

4. To find out how much the triceratops weighed before the T-Rex ate, we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to paint the room.

First, we need to find out how much area we need to paint. The room has four walls:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.

Let's calculate the area of each pair of walls:

1. **North and South Walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

2. **East and West Walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint we need. One gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet.

- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12.

- Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

So, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

   - 6 unshaken sodas
   - Total: 8 sodas left

4. **Now, Ellen's friend is going to pick a soda.** We need to find out the chance that the friend picks a shaken soda.

5. **To find the chance, we look at the number of shaken sodas and the total number of sodas left:**
   - Number of shaken sodas: 2
   - Total number of sodas left: 8

6. **The chance is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:**
   \[
   \text{Chance} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

7. **To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100:**

Imagine two toy trains starting from the same spot but going in opposite directions. One train is super fast, zooming along at 60 miles every hour. The other train is a bit slower, moving at 30 miles every hour, which is half the speed of the fast train.

Now, if both trains keep moving for 3 hours, we need to figure out how far each one goes and then add those distances together to see how far apart they are.

1. The fast train goes 60 miles in one hour. So, in 3 hours, it will go:
   \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. The slower train goes 30 miles in one hour. So, in 3 hours, it will go:
   \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

To find out how far apart they are, we add the distances they each traveled:
\( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

   - So, from March 1st to April 19th, there are 31 + 19 = 50 days.

2. **Days Billy takes off:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   - 20% of 50 days is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
   - So, Billy takes 10 days off.

3. **Days Billy works:**
   - If there are 50 days in total and he takes 10 days off, then he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. **People Billy helps each day:**
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day.
   - So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

5. **Total people helped:**
   - If Billy works for 40 days and helps 6 people each day, then he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

So, Billy helps 240 people in total.

For the second biggest slide:
- It's 240 feet long.
- People go down at 80 feet every minute.
- So, to find out how many minutes it takes, we divide the length by the speed: 240 feet ÷ 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer the biggest slide takes compared to the second biggest slide, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
- 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

   - So, each day, Bobby spends 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for breaks, which is 60 minutes in total.

2. Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days.
   - If Bobby spends 60 minutes each day, then over 5 days, he spends 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.

3. Finally, we need to convert the total minutes into hours.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

1. First, Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card. That's like having 85 dollars in a piggy bank.
2. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we need to take 15 dollars out of the piggy bank. 
   - $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
   - Now, the piggy bank has 70 dollars.
3. Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale. The frying pan usually costs $20.00, but it was 20% off. 
   - 20% of $20.00 is $4.00 (because 20 times 0.20 equals 4).
   - So, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.
   - 10% of $30.00 is $3.00 (because 30 times 0.10 equals 3).
   - So, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Now, we need to add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the piggy bank.
   - $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. This means if we have 5 jellyfish, 1 of them is large.
2. Out of these large jellyfish, a third of them change color from green to blue when the UV light is on. So, if we have 3 large jellyfish, 1 of them changes color.
3. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. These 6 jellyfish are the ones that are large and change color.

Now, let's figure out how many large jellyfish there are in total:
- If 6 jellyfish are the ones that change color, and this is a third of the large jellyfish, then the total number of large jellyfish must be 3 times 6.
- So, the total number of large jellyfish is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

Next, we need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank in total:
- We know that the large jellyfish are a fifth of the total number of jellyfish. So, if 18 jellyfish are a fifth of the total, then the total number of jellyfish must be 5 times 18.
- So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \).

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **How much money does Lauren need each year for retirement?**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \).

2. **How much money does Lauren need for 20 years of retirement?**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. **How much money does Lauren save each year?**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \).

4. **How many years does Lauren need to save $800,000?**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( 800,000 \div 20,000 = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we need to divide 100 by 4:

100 ÷ 4 = 25

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Now, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be cut into 5 equal parts. So, we need to divide 25 by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The answer is 5 centimeters."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

We know that 40% of the school is boys, and there are 240 boys. We need to find out how many students are in the whole school first.

1. If 40% of the school is 240 boys, we can set up a simple equation:
   \[ 40\% \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

2. To find the total number of students, we can rewrite 40% as a fraction:
   \[ \frac{40}{100} \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[ \frac{2}{5} \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

4. To solve for the total number of students, we need to divide both sides by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
   \[ \text{Total Students} = 240 \div \frac{2}{5} \]

5. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
   \[ \text{Total Students} = 240 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

6. Calculate the multiplication:
   \[ \text{Total Students} = 240 \times 2.5 = 600 \]

So, there are 600 students in total in the school.

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

My mom bought some things at the gardening shop. She got pots for $19 and soil for $26. That's a total of $19 + $26, which is $45. But she had a coupon for $7 off, so we need to take that away from the total. 

So, $45 - $7 = $38.

That means my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

We have six women at a party. Three of them are wearing heels that are 4 inches tall, and the other three are wearing heels that are 2 inches tall.

First, let's find out the total height of all the heels together:
- For the 4-inch heels: 3 women × 4 inches = 12 inches
- For the 2-inch heels: 3 women × 2 inches = 6 inches

Now, let's add these together to get the total height:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Next, we need to find the average height. To do this, we divide the total height by the number of women:
18 inches ÷ 6 women = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Total Miles to Hike:** Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June.
2. **Days in June:** June has 30 days.
3. **Miles Hiked Each Day:** Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 125 miles + 125 miles = 250 miles each day.
4. **Total Miles Hiked in June:** If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, she will hike 250 miles/day × 30 days = 7,500 miles.
5. **Miles Still Needed:** To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract the miles she will hike from her goal: 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.
6. **Additional Miles per Day:** To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the miles still needed by the number of days: 1,800 miles ÷ 30 days = 60 miles.

So, Soledad needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day to reach her goal of 9,300 miles in June.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

First, we need to find out how much money the store will make from selling all the red balls. There are 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, we do:
3 red balls × $9 each = $27

Next, we look at the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, we do:
11 blue balls × $5 each = $55

Then, we have the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, we do:
25 green balls × $3 each = $75

Now, we add up all the money from selling the red, blue, and green balls:
$27 (from red balls) + $55 (from blue balls) + $75 (from green balls) = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we know that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques together bought 12 kg of apples.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples. A quarter means 1 out of 4 parts. So, we divide 12 kg by 4:
\[ 12 \div 4 = 3 \text{ kg} \]
So, Pierre gets 3 kg of apples.

Next, Paul wants a third of the apples. A third means 1 out of 3 parts. So, we divide 12 kg by 3:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \text{ kg} \]
So, Paul gets 4 kg of apples.

Now, we need to find out how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left. We add the amounts Pierre and Paul took:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Then, we subtract this total from the original 12 kg:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

50 × 0.20 = 10

So, 10 more students joined the class this year. Now, we add these 10 new students to the 50 students from last year:

50 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfish
- 3 more female goldfish

Now, let's add these to the original numbers:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we add up all the male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Now, we find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:
- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - So, Dior took 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time they spent:

First, we need to figure out how far John drives to get to his parents' house. If it takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 miles per hour, we can find the distance by multiplying the time by the speed:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ miles per hour} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

So, John drives 140 miles to get to his parents' house. But he has to drive back home too, so the round trip is:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ 280 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 560 \text{ miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Now, the problem says that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. So, we need to find half of 70 miles:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

1. **First, we need to know how many toys the first four workers made:**
   - Two workers make 6 toys each hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys each.
   - Since there are two of them, together they make \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.
   - The other two workers make 4 toys each hour. So, in 10 hours, they make \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys each.
   - Since there are two of them, together they make \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

2. **Now, let's add up the toys made by the first four workers:**
   - \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

3. **The factory needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more toys after the shift:**
   - This means they made \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys during the shift.

4. **To find out how many toys the fifth worker made:**
   - We know the first four workers made 200 toys.
   - So, the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can find out how many toys they made each hour:**

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs:
- Kory's dog: 60 pounds
- Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds

2. Luis used half of the stickers he got, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. The rest of the stickers Luis had, he gave to Kris. So Kris got \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. So Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
5. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can say:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 eggs in total.

2. **Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Finding How Many Sarah Painted:**
   - Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs.
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \) eggs.
   - So, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

4. **Finding How Many Camden Painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Finding How Many Arnold and Madeline Painted:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( 2A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs.
   - So, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).
   - Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2A = 26 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( A = 13 \).

6. **Finding How Many More Eggs Camden Painted Than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons.**
   - If Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them in groups of 8, we divide 200 by 8.
   - \( 200 \div 8 = 25 \)
   - So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how many boxes Nik will need.**
   - Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

3. **Now, let's find out how much the crayons weigh.**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons.
   - So, the total weight of the crayons is \( 200 \times 1 = 200 \) ounces.

4. **Then, we need to find out how much the boxes weigh.**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes.
   - So, the total weight of the boxes is \( 25 \times 8 = 200 \) ounces.

5. **Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together.**
   - The total weight is \( 200 \) ounces (crayons) + \( 200 \) ounces (boxes) = \( 400 \) ounces.

6. **Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.**
   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.

2. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so we need to multiply Valerie's earnings by 2:
   \[
   5000 \times 2 = 10000
   \]
   So, her brother earns $10000 each month.

3. Now, let's add Valerie's and her brother's earnings to find out how much they earn together:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000
   \]
   Together, they earn $15000 each month.

4. Their mother earns twice what Valerie and her brother earn together. So, we need to multiply their combined earnings by 2:
   \[
   15000 \times 2 = 30000
   \]
   Their mother earns $30000 each month.

5. Finally, to find out how much money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's earnings:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000
   \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

1. **Beach Walking:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - It takes her 40 minutes to walk these 2 miles.
   - So, she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

2. **Sidewalk Walking:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.
   - If she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach, she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk.

Jane saves $4 every week. She has been saving for 8 weeks, so let's see how much she has saved so far:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Jane wants to save a total of $60. She already has $32, so we need to find out how much more she needs:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to figure out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28:
\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Okay, let's count the blue birds in the trees step by step!

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So, we do:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
That means there are 21 blue birds in these 3 trees.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. So, we do:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
That means there are 8 blue birds in these 2 trees.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds. So, we do:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
That means there are 3 blue birds in this tree.

Now, we add all the blue birds together:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in all the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Now, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has right now. If 24 more marbles make 60, we can find out how many he has by taking 24 away from 60:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob has 36 marbles right now.

Next, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to take 10 away from 36:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is a mystery temperature. He mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce from the mystery mug. After mixing, the water is warm enough for him to drink, which means it's at least 40 degrees.

To find out how warm the mystery mug is, we need to figure out what temperature it must be so that when mixed, the water is at least 40 degrees.

Let's call the temperature of the mystery mug \( T \).

When Donny mixes the water:
- He has 4 ounces of 33-degree water.
- He has 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water.

The total amount of water is 5 ounces (4 + 1).

The temperature of the mixed water is the average of the temperatures, weighted by the amount of water from each mug. So, we can write it like this:

\[ \text{Mixed temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We know the mixed temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, let's do the multiplication:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now, to get rid of the 5, we multiply both sides by 5:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the mystery mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixed water.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we start with 50 cows and 20 chickens on the farm. That's our starting point.

Now, every day for three weeks (which is 21 days), Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 more cows. So, we need to find out how many cows that adds up to:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Next, every day for the same three weeks, Broilers Limited brings 10 more chickens. Let's figure out how many chickens that adds up to:
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these new animals to the ones we started with:
- Cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- Chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, to find the total number of animals on the farm, we add the cows and chickens together:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to find out how much Russell spends on 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and he buys 4 packs, so:
\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]
So, without the discount, he would spend $40.00.

Next, we need to figure out the discount. The discount is 10% of $40.00. To find 10%, we can just move the decimal point one place to the left:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]
So, the discount is $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]
So, after the discount, Russell spends $36.00 for 4 packs of bagels.

Each pack has 9 bagels, and he bought 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 9 \times 4 = 36 \]
So, he has 36 bagels.

To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ 36 \div 36 = 1 \]
So, each bagel costs $1.00.

The cost per bagel is:
\[ 1.00 \]"

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's break that down:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a simple multiplication:

If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then for 18 scoops, we need:

(3 potatoes / 2 scoops) * 18 scoops = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

Next, Chester starts eating 5 eggs every day for the next 30 days. We need to find out how many eggs that is too:
5 eggs/day × 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both parts to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since we need to know how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (because there are 12 eggs in a dozen):
240 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know that the bus has 84 people in total. The number of men and women is in the ratio of 5 to 9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

To find out how many men and women there are, we can add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 9 = 14 parts in total.

Now, we need to find out how many people each part represents. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the total number of parts:
84 ÷ 14 = 6 people per part.

So, the number of men is:
5 parts × 6 people per part = 30 men.

And the number of women is:
9 parts × 6 people per part = 54 women.

Now, if 20 women get off the bus, we need to subtract 20 from the number of women:
54 women - 20 women = 34 women.

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

First, we need to figure out how many sunflowers Faraday sells each day. 

1. **Individual Sunflowers:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers.
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - So, the number of individual sunflowers he sells each day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Bouquets:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - So, the number of bouquets he sells each day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Sunflowers in Bouquets:**
   - Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets he sells each day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Total Sunflowers Sold Each Day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers he sells each day is the sum of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets.
   - Total sunflowers per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Total Sunflowers Sold in 3 Days:**
   - To find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers he sells each day by 3.
   - Total sunflowers in 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days.

So, it takes her 9 days to draw all the large scenes.

Next, we need to figure out how many days she needs for the medium-sized picture scenes. She can draw 6 medium scenes each day, and she needs to draw 36 medium scenes. So, we divide 36 by 6:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, it takes her 6 days to draw all the medium scenes.

Finally, we need to figure out how many days she needs for the small-sized picture scenes. She can draw 7 small scenes each day, and she needs to draw 49 small scenes. So, we divide 49 by 7:

Haley is 26 years old. To find out how old Geb is, we need to do two things:
1. First, we find half of Haley's age. Half of 26 is 13.
2. Then, we need to find out what 10 less than 13 is. So, we subtract 10 from 13, which gives us 3.

So, Geb is 3 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out.
2. He goes out 3 times a day.
3. So, every day, he uses:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks} \times 3 \text{ times} = 6 \text{ masks}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we need to know how many eggs Cole hid. He hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen is:
   - 3 x 12 = 36 eggs

2. Now, let's see how many eggs each person found:
   - Lamar found 5 eggs.
   - Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
     - 2 x 5 = 10 eggs
   - Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
     - 10 - 2 = 8 eggs
   - Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 eggs

3. Next, we add up all the eggs that were found:
   - Lamar: 5 eggs
   - Stacy: 10 eggs
   - Charlie: 8 eggs
   - Mei: 4 eggs
   - Total found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs

4. Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find out how many are still hidden:
   - 36 - 27 = 9 eggs

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the third building. The first two buildings each have 200 apartments, so together they have:
200 + 200 = 400 apartments

The third building is 60% bigger than these 400 apartments. To find 60% of 400, we do:
400 × 0.60 = 240 apartments

So, the third building has:
400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Now, let's add up all the apartments John collects garbage from:
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so he does:
1040 × 3 = 3120 collections in a week

John gets paid $0.40 for each collection, so his total earnings for the week are:
3120 × 0.40 = $1248

So, John makes $1248 in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree makes 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times as many fruits as a 5-year-old tree. So, 3 times 50 is 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree makes 7 times as many fruits as a 5-year-old tree. So, 7 times 50 is 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old tree makes 20 times as many fruits as a 5-year-old tree. So, 20 times 50 is 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old tree makes 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. So, 1000 minus 200 is 800 fruits.
6. A 9-year-old tree doesn't make any fruits at all. So, it's 0 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits from each year:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

So, the total number of fruits is:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Jack had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much Sophia gave Jack, we need to divide her $100 by 5:

\[ 100 \div 5 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add the $20 to the $100 Jack already had:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in class!

1. We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope. So if the blue rope is, say, 5 centimeters, the red rope would be 4 times 5, which is 20 centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the blue rope is 5 centimeters, the yellow rope would be 5 + 7, which is 12 centimeters.
3. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we add the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes together: 20 + 5 + 12 = 37 centimeters.

Now, let's check if this works:
- Red rope: 20 centimeters
- Blue rope: 5 centimeters
- Yellow rope: 12 centimeters

20 + 5 + 12 = 37

It all adds up! So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. Ronnie got $5.
2. Rissa got three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
3. Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount \(x\).
4. After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
5. The problem says Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. So, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5}
\]

\[
15 - x = \frac{60}{5}
\]

\[
15 - x = 12
\]

\[
x = 15 - 12
\]

\[
x = 3
\]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

\[
\text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - 3 = 2
\]

So, Ronnie has $2 left.

So, the amount of red paint used is:
2 pints"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide.
   - To find the area of one bedroom, we multiply the length by the width: \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.
   - Tom has 4 bedrooms, so we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4: \(240 \times 4 = 960\) square feet.

2. **Living Room:**
   - The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
   - So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5: \(240 \times 5 = 1200\) square feet.

3. **Rest of the House:**
   - The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area:**
   - To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: \(960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160\) square feet.

So, the total area of Tom's house is 3160 square feet."
"Okay, let's count the puffs of clouds Alice saw each day and add them up!

On Monday, Alice saw 3 puffs.
On Tuesday, she saw double that, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
On Wednesday, she saw double Tuesday's, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
On Thursday, she saw double Wednesday's, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
On Friday, she saw double Thursday's, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add them all up:
3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, Alice counted 93 puffs of clouds in total from Monday to Friday!"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First, we need to find out how many dishwasher pods are in the special box.**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is 20 (because 20% means 20 out of 100).
   - So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how much each pod costs in the special box.**
   - The special box costs $12.
   - There are 120 pods in the special box.
   - To find the cost of one pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods: $12 ÷ 120 = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many pods we can get for $1.**
   - If one pod costs $0.10, then for $1, we can get $1 ÷ $0.10 = 10 pods.

4. **Finally, we need to figure out how many dishwashing cycles we can run with 10 pods.**
   - Since we use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will run 10 cycles.

So, the number of dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 is:

10"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Thomas takes out $1000 in $20 bills.**
   - If each bill is $20, and he has $1000, then he has:
     \[
     1000 \div 20 = 50 \text{ bills}
     \]

2. **He loses 10 of these $20 bills.**
   - So, he has:
     \[
     50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills left}
     \]

3. **He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.**
   - Half of 40 bills is:
     \[
     40 \div 2 = 20 \text{ bills}
     \]
   - So, he has:
     \[
     40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
     \]

4. **He triples the money he has left.**
   - The value of the 20 bills he has left is:
     \[
     20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Tripling this amount gives:
     \[
     400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **He converts all his money to $5 bills.**
   - To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide the total amount by 5:
     \[
     1200 \div 5 = 240 \text{ bills}

So, Thomas ends up with **240** $5 bills."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B scores 4 × 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. So, Team A scores 8 ÷ 4 = 2 goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
   - Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.
   - Total goals in the match: 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Starting with the chalk:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

2. **What happens on Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, after Monday, the teacher has \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches of chalk left.

3. **Using 20% of the chalk each day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - This means 80% of the chalk is left each day.

4. **Calculating the remaining chalk each day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - 80% of 2.75 inches is \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - 80% of 2.20 inches is \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

5. **When does the chalk become too small?**
   - The teacher can't use the chalk when it's less than 2 inches.
   - After 1 day, the chalk is 2.20 inches, which is more than 2 inches.
   - After 2 days, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the chalk after 2 more days.

First, we know there are 12 boys and 12 girls in Miss Albert's class. That makes 24 students in total.

Now, let's find out how many of these students are on the varsity team.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity. So, we need to find one-third of 12 girls:
  \[
  \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ girls}
  \]

- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. So, we need to find one-fourth of 12 boys:
  \[
  \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ boys}
  \]

So, there are 4 girls and 3 boys on the varsity team. That means a total of:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

Now, to find out how many students are not on the varsity team, we subtract the number of students on the team from the total number of students:

2. The dentist drills 4 of his teeth.
3. The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist fixed in total. That's the number of teeth drilled plus the number of teeth capped: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First Clue:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - If Colin is \( C \) years old now, then in seven years, he will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
   - So, Wendy's age \( W \) is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

2. **Second Clue:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
   - Wendy's current age \( W \) is three times Colin's age in 25 years, so \( W = 3 \times (C + 25) \).

Now, let's use these clues to find out how old Colin is now.

From the first clue:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second clue:
\[ W = 3(C + 25) \]

Since both expressions equal \( W \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Expand both sides:
   \[ 5C + 35 = 3C + 75 \]

2. Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
   \[ 2C + 35 = 75 \]

3. Subtract 35 from both sides:
   \[ 2C = 40 \]

4. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

   - So, they gained 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total change over the three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, to find out how many bandages they started with, we need to subtract the total change from the final number of bandages:
78 - 59 = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know the color costs $40. That's easy to remember.
2. Now, for the haircut, May's hair was 10 inches long and it got cut to 8 inches. So, the hair was cut by:
   \[
   10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The cost for each inch of hair cut is $30. So, for 2 inches, the cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will get in April.

1. **First, we find out how much Jen makes in one day:**
   - Jen works for 7.5 hours each day.
   - She gets $1.5 for each hour.
   - So, 7.5 hours times $1.5 is $11.25 each day.

2. **Next, we find out how much Jen makes in one week:**
   - Jen works 6 days each week.
   - So, $11.25 each day times 6 days is $67.5 each week.

3. **Now, we find out how much Jen makes in one month:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - So, $67.5 each week times 4 weeks is $270.

4. **Finally, we add the extra money for not missing any days:**
   - Jen gets an extra $10 for not missing any days.
   - So, $270 plus $10 is $280.

Jen will get $280 in April.

"Okay, let's see how much money Jason made.

- For doing his laundry, he got $3.00. He did it once.
- For cleaning his room, he got $1.50. He did it once.
- For taking the trash out, he got $0.75 each time. He did it twice.
- For emptying the dishwasher, he got $0.50 each time. He did it six times.

Now, let's add it all up:

- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning room: $1.50
- Trash: $0.75 x 2 = $1.50
- Dishes: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00

So, $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00."

2. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, if a whale has 40 gallons, a shark has:
   \[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]
3. Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. If one shark has 120 gallons, then ten sharks have:
   \[ 120 \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"Okay, let's count the people who came to the restaurant step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people came.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came.
3. Later, twice as many people as those who came at 10:00 came for lunch. That's \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, three times as many people as those who came in the morning came. That's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these people together:

So, the total number of people who came to the restaurant that day is 320."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice as many black pens as red pens. So, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]
   Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens. So, the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

3. Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
   \]

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find out how much each bottle costs, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
\[ 600 \div 10 = 60 \]
So, each bottle of scotch costs $60.

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac. That means he buys:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
So, he buys 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find out how much more, we calculate 50% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.5 = 30 \]
So, each bottle of cognac costs:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]
Each bottle of cognac costs $90.

Now, to find out how much John spends on all the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]
So, he spends $1800 on cognac.

Finally, to find out how much he spends in total, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, John spends a total of $2400 on everything.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted:
20 White Oak trees × 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so:
20 White Oak trees + 10 White Oak trees = 30 White Oak trees on the second day.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. So, he planted:
40 Lodgepole Pine trees + (40 Lodgepole Pine trees ÷ 4) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted is:
50 White Oak trees + 90 Lodgepole Pine trees = 140 trees.

2. **Children Drink Some:**
   His children drank 4 gallons. So, we need to take away 4 gallons from 24 gallons:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Second Day:**
   Fred's wife, Barbie, spilled 7 gallons. We need to take away 7 gallons from the 20 gallons left:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in primary school.

The problem says that if you take the number of coffee mugs, multiply it by 4, and then add 8, you get 40. We need to find out how many coffee mugs there are.

First, let's write down what we know:
- If we multiply the number of mugs by 4 and then add 8, we get 40.

Let's call the number of mugs \( x \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

1. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the 8 on the left side:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Next, we divide both sides by 4 to find \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. First, we know there are 66 fish in the tank. That's a lot of fish!
2. One-third of these fish have red stripes. To find out how many that is, we divide 66 by 3:
   - 66 ÷ 3 = 22
   - So, 22 fish have red stripes.
3. Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after we take away the ones with red stripes:
   - 66 - 22 = 44
   - So, there are 44 fish left.
4. Out of these 44 fish, 5 out of every 11 have blue stripes. To find out how many that is, we can divide 44 by 11 and then multiply by 5:
   - 44 ÷ 11 = 4
   - 4 × 5 = 20
   - So, 20 fish have blue stripes.
5. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total:
   - 22 (red-striped fish) + 20 (blue-striped fish) = 42

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, and each palette had 4 colors. So, that's:
2 palettes × 4 colors = 8 colors

Next, she had three makeup sets, and each set had 6 colors. So, that's:
3 sets × 6 colors = 18 colors

Now, let's add the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets to find out how many colors Amy had at first:
8 colors + 18 colors = 26 colors

But then, her sister steals one of the palettes. Since each palette has 4 colors, Amy loses:
26 colors - 4 colors = 22 colors

After that, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 is:
6 colors ÷ 2 = 3 colors

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one makeup set, and we need to subtract that from the 22 colors she has left:
22 colors - 3 colors = 19 colors

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall. That's how big he is from his toes to the top of his head.
2. His house is 7 times as tall as he is. So, we need to multiply 60 by 7 to find out how tall the house is:
   \[
   60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the house is 420 inches tall from the ground to the very top of the roof.
3. The first floor of the house is 3 times as tall as Mattison. So, we need to multiply 60 by 3 to find out how tall the first floor is:

So, the Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells are left:
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Next, The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find out how many that is, we do:
60% of 420 = 0.60 * 420 = 252 shells

So, The Finders found 252 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells are left for the Gogetters:

Bernie has 4 dogs, and they all need to walk a certain number of miles each day. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. On average, each dog needs to walk 3 miles a day.

First, let's find out how many miles all the dogs need to walk together in a day. Since the average is 3 miles for 4 dogs, we do:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the first three dogs walk:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

So, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles:

First, we need to find out how much money John got from the loan. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan for 40% of that. 

To find 40% of $250,000, we do:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets $100,000 from the loan.

Next, John uses 60% of this $100,000 to pay off his debts. 

To find 60% of $100,000, we do:

Trinity bought some magazines for $72. She then sells them for 11/8 of what she paid. We need to find out how much more money she made by selling them.

First, we need to figure out what 11/8 of $72 is. This means we multiply 72 by 11 and then divide by 8.

1. Multiply 72 by 11:
   \( 72 \times 11 = 792 \)

2. Now, divide 792 by 8:

So, Trinity sells the magazines for $99.

Next, we need to find out how much profit she made. Profit is the money she made selling the magazines minus the money she spent buying them.

First, we need to figure out how much water the dehumidifier takes out of the air each day on different settings:

- On the low setting, it takes out 1 liter of water each day.
- On the medium setting, it takes out twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters each day.
- On the high setting, it takes out twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters each day.

Now, let's see how much water it takes out over the days Brian used it:

- For the first 3 days, it was on the low setting. So, it took out 1 liter each day for 3 days:
  \[
  1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
  \]

- For the next 3 days, it was on the medium setting. So, it took out 2 liters each day for 3 days:
  \[
  2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}
  \]

- For the last 5 days, it was on the high setting. So, it took out 4 liters each day for 5 days:
  \[
  4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali has one big class with 120 students. So, his school can hold 120 students in total.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two smaller classes. Each of his classes can hold 1/8 of the number of students in Ali's class.
   - To find out how many students each of John's classes can hold, we divide 120 by 8:
     \[
     120 \div 8 = 15

   - So, each of John's classes can hold 15 students.
   - Since John has two classes, we multiply 15 by 2:

   - So, John's school can hold 30 students in total.

3. **Combined Capacity:**

   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to pay an extra 2% of $300.
   - 2% of $300 is \( 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \) dollars.
   - So, the total amount he owes is \( 300 + 6 = 306 \) dollars.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to find out how much space the jar can hold.** The jar is a box shape, so we multiply the length, width, and height:
   - Length = 6 inches
   - Width = 6 inches
   - Height = 15 inches
   - So, the volume of the jar is \(6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540\) cubic inches.

2. **Next, we need to think about how much of that space the jelly beans actually take up.** Tim knows that the jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar because they don't pack perfectly. So, we calculate 80% of 540 cubic inches:
   - \(540 \times 0.80 = 432\) cubic inches

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many jelly beans can fit in that space.** Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. So, we divide the space by the size of one jelly bean:
   - \(432 \div 0.15 = 2880\) jelly beans

4. **Tim thinks that 30% of the jelly beans are red.** So, we calculate 30% of 2880:
   - \(2880 \times 0.30 = 864\) red jelly beans

5. **Finally, we need to see how close Tim's guess was to the real number of red jelly beans.** The real number of red jelly beans is 900. So, we subtract Tim's guess from the real number:

   - 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

4. **At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles.**
   - If there are 90 people, and the number doubles, we multiply 90 by 2.

First, we need to figure out how much Pauline spends on her visits to the museum before the price goes up.

1. Pauline visits the museum 3 times every year.
2. Each visit costs $2.
3. She does this for 5 years.

So, for 5 years, the total cost is:
3 visits/year × $2/visit × 5 years = $30

Next, the price of a visit goes up by 150%. We need to find out what the new price is.

1. 150% of $2 is calculated like this:
   150% = 150/100 = 1.5
   1.5 × $2 = $3

2. So, the new price of a visit is:
   $2 + $3 = $5

Now, Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new price.

1. For 3 years, the total cost is:
   3 visits/year × $5/visit × 3 years = $45

Finally, we add the costs from both periods to find the total amount Pauline spent.

1. Total cost for 5 years at $2 per visit = $30
2. Total cost for 3 years at $5 per visit = $45

So, the total amount Pauline spent is:
$30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent $75 on all her visits to the museum."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we need to figure out how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th). So, we do:

10 students/grade × 4 grades = 40 students

Next, we need to know how many groups of 8 students we can make from these 40 students. We do:

40 students ÷ 8 students/group = 5 groups

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we need to find out how long it will take for all 5 groups to have their turn. We do:

5 groups × 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

225"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the wooden tables cost. John made 4 wooden tables, and each table costs $20. So, we multiply 4 by 20:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, we need to find out how much the roof frames cost. John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, we multiply 2 by 10:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames together to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, and one piece is 4 times longer than the other.

Let's call the shorter piece ""S"" and the longer piece ""L.""

We know:
1. The longer piece (L) is 4 times the shorter piece (S).
2. The total length of the board is 40 feet.

So, we can write:
\[ L = 4S \]

And the total length is:
\[ S + L = 40 \]

Now, we can replace \( L \) with \( 4S \) in the total length equation:
\[ S + 4S = 40 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5S = 40 \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ S = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. 

Now, to find the longer piece:
\[ L = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ 80 \text{ meatballs} \div 16 \text{ meatballs per pound} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef. For each pound of ground beef, he uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

First, we need to find out how wide all the windows are together. Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are 5 windows. So, we do:
\[ 35 \text{ inches} \times 5 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we do:
\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to figure out how much the first 16 minutes of the call cost. The payphone charges 25 cents for each minute. So, we multiply 16 minutes by 25 cents:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \]
So, the first 16 minutes cost $4.00.

Next, we need to find out how much the remaining 20 minutes cost. After 16 minutes, the price drops to 20 cents per minute. So, we multiply 20 minutes by 20 cents:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
So, the remaining 20 minutes also cost $4.00.

Now, we add the costs of both parts of the call together:
\[ 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

8.00"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. On Monday, it rained 2 inches. Now, on Tuesday, it's going to rain 1 inch more than twice what it rained on Monday. 

First, we need to find out what twice the rain on Monday is:
2 inches (Monday's rain) × 2 = 4 inches

Now, we add 1 more inch to that:
4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

So, on Tuesday, it will rain 5 inches.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle in class!

First, we need to figure out how many treats Carly made in total. Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, we do:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats per person} = 10 \text{ treats} \]

Next, we know that Carly made some cupcakes and some brownies. The problem says she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's use a simple way to figure this out.

Let's say Carly made \( c \) cupcakes. Then, the number of brownies she made is:
\[ 3c - 2 \]

Now, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10. So, we can write:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine the \( c \) terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides to get rid of the -2:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

3. Divide both sides by 4 to find \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together before the discount. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. So, we add these together:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, the salon gives a 20% discount if you get both. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the nail art costs $3 per nail. So, we multiply the number of nails by the cost per nail:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]"
"Okay, let's count the magazines Susan gets every year.

First, Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, we do:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, we add:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

Then, she has another magazine that sends 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add all the issues together:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. The problem says Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has.
   - 27 + 12 = 39
   - So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. The problem also says that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we take 8 away from Shelley's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has.
   - 39 - 8 = 31
   - So, Kim has 31 paintings.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

1. **First, we start with the price in November**: The toy costs $40.
2. **Then, in December, the price goes up by 80%**:
   - To find 80% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.80 (which is the same as 80/100).
   - \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \).
   - So, the price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \) dollars.
3. **In January, the price goes down by 50%**:
   - To find 50% of $72, we multiply 72 by 0.50 (which is the same as 50/100).
   - \( 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \).
   - So, the price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \) dollars.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

Next, we need to find out how much he makes from the lessons with veterans:
- He gives a 25% discount to veterans, so the price is 75% of $80.
- To find 75% of $80, we do \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per lesson.
- He teaches 2 lessons to veterans, so \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
- \(320 + 120 = 440\) dollars.

So, Charlie will make 440 dollars for the day."

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many apples are left:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]
So, Walter has 36 apples left.

Next, he gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find 25% of 36, we do:
\[ 36 \times \frac{25}{100} = 9 \]
So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how many apples Walter has left after giving some to his sister:
\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]
So, Walter has 27 apples left.

Finally, Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he got, we do:

1. **Find out how far Michael travels in one day:**
   - Michael drives at 50 kilometers every hour.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, in one day, he travels \(50 \times 24 = 1200\) kilometers.

2. **Find out how far Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - If he travels 1200 kilometers in one day, in 3 days he will travel \(1200 \times 3 = 3600\) kilometers.

3. **Find out what part of the total distance this is:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 kilometers.
   - To find out what part 3600 kilometers is of 6000 kilometers, we use a simple formula:
     \[
     \text{Part} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100\%

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in school.

First, we need to figure out how much Bud spends each week on making macaroni and cheese.

1. The pasta costs $1.00.
2. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
3. The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add these up to find the total cost for one week:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

So, Bud spends $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese.

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them. She makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, but 4 less. And she makes 116 ice cubes in total.

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \).

The number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

Now, we know the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

First, we need to count the flashlights:
- Each person in the house has a flashlight. There are 4 people, so that's 4 flashlights.
- Each room has 2 flashlights. There are 8 rooms, so that's 2 flashlights per room times 8 rooms, which is 16 flashlights.
- So, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of 8 is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms with 4 small candles each means 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. Again, half of 8 is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each means 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.
- So, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the flashlights and candles together:
- Total flashlights = 20

Now, Mitchell wants to share these chips equally among his family. There are 5 people in his family. To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of people:

110 chips ÷ 5 people = 22 chips per person

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. For the second and third sides, he takes twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes 5 minutes × 2 = 10 minutes.
3. For the fourth and fifth sides, he takes half the time it took for the first side. So, each of these sides takes 5 minutes ÷ 2 = 2.5 minutes.
4. Once he finishes the fifth side, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up all the time:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

First, we know there are 20 helmets. That's a lot of helmets!

Now, the number of robots is half as many as the helmets. So, if we have 20 helmets, we divide that by 2 to find the number of robots:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 robots.

Next, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. So, if we have 20 helmets, we multiply that by 2 to find the number of footballs:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 footballs.

Now, let's add up all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ robots} + 20 \text{ helmets} + 40 \text{ footballs} = 70 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in primary school.

First, we need to find out how many hours Tim works in a whole week. He works 6 hours each day, and he works 5 days a week. So, we do:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many minutes are in those 30 hours. We know there are 60 minutes in one hour, so:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that each call takes 15 minutes. To find out how many calls Tim can handle in 1800 minutes, we divide:
\[ 1800 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. If one painting takes 12 minutes, then 6 paintings will take:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much longer the new varnish takes compared to the old varnish. We do this by subtracting the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Plants that need half a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 4 plants that each need half a cup of water.
   - So, \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups of water for these plants.

2. **Plants that need 1 cup of water:**
   - Crista has 8 plants that each need 1 cup of water.
   - So, \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups of water for these plants.

3. **Plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - She already counted 4 plants that need half a cup and 8 plants that need 1 cup.
   - So, the rest of the plants are \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs a quarter of a cup of water.
   - So, \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups of water for these plants.

Now, let's add up all the water needed:
- \(2\) cups for the half-cup plants
- \(8\) cups for the 1-cup plants
- \(2\) cups for the quarter-cup plants

So, \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups of water.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water. So, he has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

1. **On Land:**
   - Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to hop 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **In Water:**
   - Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to swim 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Now, we add the time it takes to travel on land and in water:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

2. Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts he makes in June. June has 30 days, so:
   \[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts in June} \]

3. Now, we need to figure out how much money he makes from selling all these doughnuts. Each doughnut sells for $2, so:
   \[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

- If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and does 6 batches each day, then she uploads \(7 \times 6 = 42\) photos each day.

Now, we need to figure out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos:
- If she uploads 42 photos each day, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload each day: \(210 \div 42 = 5\).

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

First, we need to know how much Alicia pays for each type of clothing every week:
- For blouses: She has 5 blouses, and each costs $5.00 to clean. So, 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- For pants: She has 2 pairs of pants, and each costs $8.00 to clean. So, 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- For skirts: She has 1 skirt, and it costs $6.00 to clean. So, 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, let's add up all these costs to find out how much she pays in one week:
- Total for one week = $25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirt) = $47.00

Since we need to find out how much she pays for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
- Total for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

Then, in the following 30 seconds, four times as many pop as the first 30 seconds. So, we count 20 four times: 20, 40, 60, 80. That's 80 more pops!

In the last 30 seconds, half as many pop as the last 30 seconds. So, we take 80 and cut it in half: 40. That's 40 more pops!

After the pan is off the heat, a quarter of the last 30 seconds' pops happen. So, we take 40 and divide it by 4: 10. That's 10 more pops!

- So, 5 kilograms times 3 German Shepherds equals 15 kilograms of food per day for the German Shepherds.

Next, let's figure out how much food the Bulldogs eat in one day:
- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, 3 kilograms times 2 Bulldogs equals 6 kilograms of food per day for the Bulldogs.

Now, we add the food for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to find out how much food all the dogs eat in one day:
- 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms of food per day for all the dogs.

Finally, we need to find out how much food they eat in a week:

So, the 15 animals with 4 legs have 60 legs in total.

Now, we add the legs from both groups of animals:
20 legs (from the 2-legged animals) + 60 legs (from the 4-legged animals) = 80 legs

   - It loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the amount the pigs ate from the total amount of feed:
   - 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds left.

So, after a week, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. First, we need to figure out how many hot dogs John needs for his party. He invited 20 friends, and each friend will eat 2 hot dogs. So, we do:
   20 friends × 2 hot dogs per friend = 40 hot dogs.

2. John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, we need to find out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy:
   40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs he already has = 36 hot dogs.

3. Now, hot dogs come in packs of 6. We need to find out how many packs John needs to buy to get 36 hot dogs. We do:
   36 hot dogs ÷ 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

4. Each pack costs $2. So, to find out how much John needs to spend, we do:
   6 packs × $2 per pack = $12.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each. So, 20 cupcakes times $2 is:
  \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) dollars.

- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, 40 cookies times $1 is:
  \( 40 \times 1 = 40 \) dollars.

Now, we add the money from the cupcakes and the cookies to find the total money she makes:
\( 40 + 40 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances spends on the trays.

- She buys 5 trays at $4 each. So, 5 trays times $4 is:
  \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the money she spends on the trays from the total money she makes to find out how much money she has left:
\( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars.

So, Frances has 60 dollars left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First Street:**
   - The ice cream truck starts with 5 children following it.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of those 5 children brings another child.
   - So, 5 children each bring 1 more child: \(5 + 5 = 10\) children now.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children brings 2 more children.
   - So, 10 children each bring 2 more children: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) new children.
   - Adding these 20 new children to the 10 already there: \(10 + 20 = 30\) children now.

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - The original 5 children who started following the truck get tired and leave.
   - So, we subtract those 5 children: \(30 - 5 = 25\) children.

So, the number of children now following the truck is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Mamou has 1,360 meals to give out. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals. On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals. And on Sunday, she gave out 48 meals. 

First, we need to add up all the meals she gave out:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she started with:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"Okay, let's count the money James found!

- He found 1 quarter, and a quarter is 25 cents.
- He also found 2 nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so 2 nickels are 10 cents.
- Lastly, he found 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so 7 dimes are 70 cents.

Now, let's add them all up:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We have 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is:

2. We have 2 brothers. One brother is 12 years old, and the other brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother. So, the older brother is:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]

3. Now, we add the ages of the two brothers:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - So, she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes each day.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for \(30 \times 7 = 210\) minutes.
   - In 4 weeks, she meditates for \(210 \times 4 = 840\) minutes.

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma does yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) 5 days a week.
   - So, in one week, she does yoga for \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes.
   - In 4 weeks, she does yoga for \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Now, we add the time she spends on meditation and yoga.
   - Total time in 4 weeks is \(840 + 1200 = 2040\) minutes.

So, Charisma spends 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure out how big the quilt will be!

First, we need to know how much space each size of t-shirt takes up:
- Small t-shirts are 3 square feet each.
- Medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each.
- Large t-shirts are 6 square feet each.

Now, let's count how many of each size Octavia is using:
- She uses 11 small t-shirts.
- She uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- She uses 6 large t-shirts.

Next, we calculate the total area for each size:
- For the small t-shirts: 11 t-shirts * 3 square feet each = 33 square feet.
- For the medium t-shirts: 8 t-shirts * 4 square feet each = 32 square feet.
- For the large t-shirts: 6 t-shirts * 6 square feet each = 36 square feet.

Finally, we add up all the areas to get the total size of the quilt:
- Total area = 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

First, we need to figure out how many seeds are in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower like this:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we do:
\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]
So, a large sunflower has:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds together:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem!

First, Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store has a deal: buy one, get one at half price. Each T-shirt costs $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays half the price: $8 ÷ 2 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
$8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

- To find the discount, we calculate 40% of $40: $40 × 0.40 = $16.
- The price Jake pays for the shoes is the original price minus the discount: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make one jar of Tim's special honey and jam mix. 

- For the passion fruit, Tim needs 2 pounds, and it costs $6 per pound. So, 2 pounds times $6 is $12.
- For the jackfruit, Tim needs 1.5 pounds, and it costs $8 per pound. So, 1.5 pounds times $8 is $12.
- For the honey, Tim needs 2 pounds, and it costs $10 per pound. So, 2 pounds times $10 is $20.

Now, let's add up all these costs to find out how much one jar costs:
- $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

So, it costs $44 to make one jar.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to make 10 jars:
- $44 (cost per jar) times 10 jars = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so for 10 jars, he makes:
- $50 (price per jar) times 10 jars = $500

To find out how much profit Tim makes, we subtract the total cost from the total money he makes:
- $500 (total money made) - $440 (total cost) = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Justin has in his jar. We need to add up the value of all the coins.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Justin has 32 quarters.
   - 32 quarters × 25 cents = 800 cents

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Justin has 95 dimes.
   - 95 dimes × 10 cents = 950 cents

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Justin has 120 nickels.
   - 120 nickels × 5 cents = 600 cents

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Justin has 750 pennies.
   - 750 pennies × 1 cent = 750 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
- 800 cents (from quarters) + 950 cents (from dimes) + 600 cents (from nickels) + 750 cents (from pennies) = 3100 cents

Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, we divide 3100 cents by 100 to get the total in dollars:
- 3100 cents ÷ 100 = 31 dollars

So, the total amount of money in the jar is:

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who will pay different prices for different parts of his collection.

1. First, we need to split the 12 toy soldiers into two equal groups. Since 12 divided by 2 is 6, each group will have 6 toy soldiers.
2. For the first group of 6 toy soldiers, the buyer will pay $5 for each toy. So, we need to multiply 6 by 5:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30

   This means Matthew will get $30 for the first group.
3. For the second group of 6 toy soldiers, the buyer will pay $7 for each toy. So, we need to multiply 6 by 7:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42

2. When Nate gets back, he starts filling in the holes. He can fill 9 holes each day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, each day, Nate actually fills:
   \[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

3. Now, we need to figure out how many days it will take Nate to fill all 84 holes if he fills 3 holes each day. We do:
   \[ 84 \text{ holes} \div 3 \text{ holes/day} = 28 \text{ days} \]

4. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how many weeks 28 days is. We do:

- He only got half as many test tubes as asked, so he got \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
- He got two more Petri dishes than asked, so he got \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

In total, Igor put 29 items on the lab bench. We need to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let's add up the items Igor actually put on the bench:
- 8 test tubes

3. **Aaron's Time**: Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes. That means he runs 1 mile in 8 minutes (because 16 minutes divided by 2 miles is 8 minutes per mile).
4. **Vanessa's Speed**: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, if Aaron takes 8 minutes to run 1 mile, Vanessa takes 16 minutes to run 1 mile (because 8 minutes times 2 is 16 minutes per mile).
5. **Vanessa's Time**: Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she takes 16 minutes to run 1 mile, for 4 miles, she would take 4 times 16 minutes, which is 64 minutes.

   - Total amount made = $80 (cost) + $20 (profit) = $100.

4. The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total amount by the number of watermelons:
   - Price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2.

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, right now, Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is 2 × 9 = 18 years old.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is 18 years old now.
   - So, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is 37 years old now.
   - So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school.

Imagine Ana and Jane are peeling oranges. Ana is faster and can peel an orange in 3 minutes. Jane is a bit slower and takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.

Now, let's see how many oranges each of them can peel in one hour (which is 60 minutes).

- Ana can peel 1 orange in 3 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

- Jane can peel 1 orange in 4 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in one hour. We do this by subtracting the number of oranges Jane can peel from the number of oranges Ana can peel:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

So, after one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, Mark needs a new radiator. The radiator costs $400, but he gets it for 80% off. That means he only pays 20% of the price. 

To find 20% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours. 

To find the total cost for the mechanic:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid a total of $230.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have 70 legs in total. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

1. **First, let's think about the animals:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs.
   - Cows have 4 legs.

2. **Now, let's use what we know:**
   - If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have \(20 \times 2 = 40\) legs.
   - But we know they have 70 legs in total, which is 30 more legs than if they were all chickens.

3. **So, let's think about the extra legs:**
   - Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken.
   - To get 30 extra legs, we need \(30 \div 2 = 15\) cows.

4. **Now, let's find out how many chickens there are:**
   - If there are 15 cows, then the rest of the animals must be chickens.
   - So, \(20 - 15 = 5\) chickens.

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens!

"Okay, let's think about this like we're in primary school. Henry and his 3 friends, so that's 4 people in total, ordered 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 pieces. 

First, we need to find out how many pieces of pizza there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of pieces each pizza is cut into:
7 pizzas * 8 pieces per pizza = 56 pieces

Now, we need to share these 56 pieces equally among the 4 people. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of people:
56 pieces / 4 people = 14 pieces per person

So, each person can have 14 pieces of pizza.
