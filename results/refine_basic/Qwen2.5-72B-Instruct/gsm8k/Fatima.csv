"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure this out.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The remaining eggs that she can sell are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * 2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

First, let's calculate the total investment:
- Purchase price of the house: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Next, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value:
- Original value of the house: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- New value of the house: $200,000
- Total investment: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down:

James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. So, to find out how many meters he runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

Here's the calculation:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters each week.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement:**
   - Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Total daily feed requirement = 3 cups/chicken/day * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

2. **Calculate the total feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
   - Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

3. **Determine the feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total daily feed requirement = 60 cups.
   - Total feed given so far = 40 cups.
   - Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

We know that:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Let's calculate the number of sheep in each city step by step.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of sheep in all three cities:
- Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
- Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time so far is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time to download the full file again:**
   - The full file size is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Add the time to download the full file again to the total time:**
   - Total time is \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \).

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:
\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
   \[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]
3. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month, so:
   \[ 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, let's add up the downloads over the three months:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, let's break it down:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 * $68 = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 * $80 = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up the total costs for all the pastries:
- Total cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694.

The total cost is $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and see when it covers the initial planting cost.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3
4. **Net Annual Profit**: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.

3. After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. Melanie then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

8. To solve for \( x \), first multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

9. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

10. Multiply both sides by 3:
    \[
    2x = 36
    \]

11. Divide both sides by 2:
    \[
    x = 18
    \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Sure, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. In 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail if she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:

\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the water in the original 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Water in 10 liters of orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters.
   - Water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Water in 15 liters of pineapple drink: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

4. **Combine the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:**
   - Total volume of the mixture: \( 9 + 15 = 24 \) liters.
   - Total water in the mixture: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that each cost $3, 4 apples that each cost $1.50, and some boxes of pizza. The total amount she paid was $50. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, given that each box costs $8.50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- The 4 apples cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, let's break down each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then extend that to a week.

1. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
2. John has 10 dogs.

First, we calculate the total time spent per day:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent per week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, let's start by figuring out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. This means he makes:

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs:

8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount he spent is:

$195 - $5 = $190

Since he used all the money from selling his lego sets and has $5 left, he no longer has any of the lego sets he sold. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \(6\) miles per hour × \(2\) hours = \(12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5\) miles per hour × \(4\) hours = \(6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12\) miles + \(6\) miles = \(18\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her usual distance. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total calories in the bag:**
   - The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories:**
   - The entire 300g bag has 1250 calories.
   - Grams per calorie = 300 grams / 1250 calories = 0.24 grams/calorie.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories * 0.24 grams/calorie = 48 grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Post-it Notes Remaining**: After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
   - Cost per red tie = 40 + 0.5 * 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = 600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties

"To figure out how much money Bailey started with, we need to consider the total amount she had at the end and subtract the money she received over the 8 weeks.

Bailey received $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. This means the amount she started with plus the $40 she received equals $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the $40 from $100:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days:
- The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
- So, for 180 days, the puppy will need:
  \[
  180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days of the year:
- The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day.
- So, for 185 days, the puppy will need:
  \[
  185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
  \]

Now, we add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food are needed, given that each bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
\]

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining how much laundry David does. We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, let's compare the costs of the two options:

1. **Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50:**
   - Each package contains 3 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
   - The total cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Buying in packages of 2 for $1:**
   - Each package contains 2 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
   - The total cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

By comparing the two costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.

The savings by choosing the better price (packages of 2) is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"To solve this, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( W \) be the number of games won and \( L \) be the number of games lost. We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question about John's water drinking habits.

John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and also before he goes to bed every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per weekday. On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but has a soda with dinner, so that's 3 glasses of water per day on the weekend.

Let's calculate the total:

- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses
- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Adding these together, John drinks a total of 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across. We know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to cover 14 segments, knowing that each segment takes 10 minutes:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, I'll calculate how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

After Poppy's mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[
\boxed{500}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the thickness of the walls. Each box has an outer dimension of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions:**
   - The inner length is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches (subtract 1 inch from each side).
   - The inner width is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches (subtract 1 inch from each side).
   - The inner height is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches (subtract 1 inch from each side).

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and see how much time was spent on Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour (favorite show) + 0.5 hours (30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour (first episode) + 1 hour (second episode) = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To figure out how much profit I make, I need to calculate the total cost of the lumber I bought and the total revenue I will make from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- I have 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100
  \]
- I also have 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = 15
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water and the total amount of both combined.

1. **Identify the ratio and total amount:**
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the common factor for the ratio.
   - Therefore, the amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons.
   - The amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups.
   - The total amount is the sum of the sugar and water: \( 7x + 13x = 20x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that \( 20x = 120 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 20, we get \( x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

4. **Calculate the amount of sugar:**
   - The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \).
   - Substituting \( x = 6 \), we get \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

First, let's find Lylah's salary:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we apply the 40% increase to Lylah's salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many questions Mark completed in each test based on the time he had and his rate of completing questions.

For the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

So, the number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

So, the number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the equation based on the information given:

Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs, and \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's define the number of queens as \( Q \).
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question about John's pineapple harvest.

John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples. This means the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To figure out how much Shawnda made, let's break down the costs:

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get both tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

"Let's solve this step by step, starting with the information given:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry.
6. Five fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( x \).

First, we account for the fries eaten by Dave and the seagull:
\[ x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \]

Next, the three pigeons ate 9 fries:
\[ x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \]

The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
\[ \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30 \]
\[ \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \]
\[ \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \]

The ants carried off one fry:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \]

We know that 5 fries were left:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries Dave bought is \( 48 \).

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, we calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
- Total hours per week = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
- Total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - Add the lengths of all the baked goods: \( 100 \) feet (rolls) + \( 60 \) feet (croissants) + \( 120 \) feet (baguettes) = \( 280 \) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.
3. **Number of Increases**: Over 36 months, there are 36 / 2 = 18 two-month periods.
4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}

On the weekends, which are Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the weekends, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add the miles from the weekdays and the weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. **Calculate the total annual payment:**
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"Sure, let's calculate the total time it will take me to prep the potatoes for the family reunion barbecue.

First, I'll calculate the time needed to peel the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, I'll calculate the time needed to cut the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Now, I'll convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, I'll add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, it will take me 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To solve this, let's break down Zaid's monthly expenses and donations step by step:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount:**
   After paying for rent and car fuel, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Charity Donation:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Charity Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final Remaining Amount:**
   After the charity donation, the remaining amount is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5

"To figure out how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increase in his weekly salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **One-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Original weekly salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.

3. **Original annual salary:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **New weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New annual salary with the raise:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money made in the year:**
   - Total money = One-time monetary reward + New annual salary
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

$114,200"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces each year.

First, let's break down the problem:

1. Josie has a 10-acre farm.
2. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
3. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

Now, let's calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:
- Total tons of grapes = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine:
- Total barrels of wine = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cheese for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode during the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode during the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance:
- Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Weight of the Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40 grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the Candied Apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20 grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**
   - Total weight of the bag = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To figure out how many times I need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, I'll start by calculating the total cost of the items I want to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since I want 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

I already have $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount I need is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

I earn $5 each time I babysit. I babysit 4 times, so my total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding my babysitting earnings to my savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

I still need:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

I earn $4 each time I mow the lawn. To find out how many times I need to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, I divide the remaining amount by my earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, I must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Jerry has a flock of chickens, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, while the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, we need to find out how many red chickens he has.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the values for \(d\) and \(v\):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We need to find the number of customers on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[
100 + 150 + x = 500
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
250 + x = 500
\]
\[
x = 500 - 250

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool.
2. Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
  \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
  \[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To figure out how many tomato vines Steve needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
2. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes per week.
5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so to produce 63 tomatoes, Steve needs \(63 \div 3 = 21\) vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these, he can make 1 more full pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the sum of the initial pens, the first batch of new pens, and the second batch of new pens.

25 (initial) + 5 (first batch) + 1 (second batch) = 31

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of students in the school hall is 1000.
2. 30% of the students left through exit A. So, 30% of 1000 is:
   \[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]
   Therefore, 300 students left through exit A.
3. The remaining number of students after 300 left through exit A is:
   \[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]
4. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students left through exit B. So, 3/5 of 700 is:
   \[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]
   Therefore, 420 students left through exit B.
5. The remaining number of students who left through exit C is:
   \[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can determine Robert's candies by dividing John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - So, the number of pen pals he still has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters he receives each week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of pages he needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time he spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information:

- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time is:

"To solve this, let's break down the total number of stitches used for the different parts of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \(900 \div 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.

Adding these up, the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette are:
\[900 + 90 + 180 = 1170\]

The entire sweater project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[1800 - 1170 = 630\]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[630 \div 2 = 315\]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. Each of them will be 10 years older, so we add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to the current sum:

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we can determine the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To figure out how much John pays a year for his driving service, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - The driving service charges $2 per mile, so the cost for 15,000 miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total cost for the miles driven is $30,000.
   - The total bonus is $1,800.

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged. Each piece of paper, when folded, can hold 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.

So, if we have 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods are required for her to lose 8 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4
   \]

4. Since each period is 4 weeks, the total number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa. Let's break down his expenses:

1. **Business Suits**: 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   \[

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cera's Current Age:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

"To solve this, we first add up all the paintball guns that DJ, Nick, RJ, and Richard have:

- DJ has 8 guns
- Nick has 10 guns
- RJ has 1 gun
- Richard has 5 guns

Adding these together: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns in total.

Since there are 4 people, we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many guns each person would have if they were shared equally:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The total initial cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold half the number of pairs sold on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\(50 \times 2 = 100\) shoes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. Let's calculate the total amount of milk she collects.

First, we divide the 30 sheep into two groups:
- 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each.
- 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, let's calculate the total milk from each group:
- From the first group: 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
- From the second group: 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding these amounts together gives us the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then determine the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To solve this problem, let's calculate the total distance each person hiked.

First, for Cho:
- Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance for Cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, for Chloe:
- Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance for Chloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe:
- Difference in distance = Distance for Cho - Distance for Chloe
- Difference in distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the remaining land represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation can be written as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Sure, let's calculate the energy savings step by step.

1. **Determine the original daily energy usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the new daily energy usage after reducing the time:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so the initial number of corns is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80
     \]

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
     \[
     40 + 60 = 100
     \]

3. **After Buying Fewer Corns:**
   - Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
     \[
     100 - 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is:
     \[
     60 + 100 = 160
     \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
160

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can add up the steps he has already taken and subtract this from his total goal, then subtract the steps he still needs to take.

Steps already taken:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left to reach his goal:
10,000 (total goal) - 6,000 (already taken) = 4,000 steps

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
4,000 (steps needed to reach goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book:**
   - The book is 45 pages long.
   - Each page has an average of 200 words.
   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport:**
   - Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.
   - It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
   - Time available to read = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Determine how early Toby will be:**
   - Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes.
   - Time left after reading = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Sally has $10 to spend. She buys 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells, and 4 magnets. Let's calculate the total cost of each item.

1. **Taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Mixed bag of seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 4 magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of taffy: $4.50
- Total cost of seashells: $1.50
- Total cost of magnets: $1.00
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"To figure out how much Tim spent in total, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it's \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After applying the discount, the cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total, the final amount Tim spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To figure out how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Charlotte wants to buy before any discounts:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's drive time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine Wayne's departure time:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

5. **Calculate the difference in their departure times:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, we calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To solve this, let's break down the laundry items per room and then calculate the total for 80 rooms.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: 2 sheets/room * 80 rooms = 160 sheets
- **Total comforters**: 1 comforter/room * 80 rooms = 80 comforters
- **Total pillow cases**: 4 pillow cases/room * 80 rooms = 320 pillow cases
- **Total towels**: 8 towels/room * 80 rooms = 640 towels

Adding these together gives us the total number of pieces of laundry:

160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = 1200 pieces of laundry

"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with all her sprinkles. 

Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs to bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the information given. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up the equation to find the total number of students:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
\]

To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to consider the overlaps between the allergies. 

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Total: 9 + 6 = 15

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they have been counted twice. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
- Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total kids in the class: 32
- Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to get the total number of people:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

"To solve this, let's first add the fractions of the skein that Mariah and her grandma used:

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4.

So, \( \frac{1}{2} \) can be written as \( \frac{2}{4} \).

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate the total yards used by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which cost $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To figure out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of bus trips without the pass:**
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
   - She does this 5 days a week.
   - So, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - Therefore, the total cost of bus trips per week is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:**
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings by buying the weekly bus pass is the difference between the total cost of bus trips without the pass and the cost of the weekly bus pass.
   - Savings = Total cost without the pass - Cost of the pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for.

First, let's determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Adding these up:
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs:
- Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
- Total calories to lose 30 lbs = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, we find the daily calorie deficit:
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
- Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To figure out how many more vlogs I need to make to reach my goal of 72 vlogs for the month, I'll add up the vlogs I've already made and subtract that from 72.

I made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. So, the total number of vlogs I've made so far is:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more vlogs I need to make, I subtract the vlogs I've already made from my goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, I need to make 18 more vlogs to complete my goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To figure out how much I need to pay, I first calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since my wife and I are splitting the bill evenly, but I'm paying the entire tip, I pay half of the original bill plus the full tip:

Half of the original bill: $50 / 2 = $25
Full tip: $10

Total amount I pay: $25 + $10 = $35

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total amount of $18 is shared equally among 3 boys. Each boy gets:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The following day, he adds another $10:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. After spending, he triples the amount he has left:
   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the eldest boy now has:
\[
39 \text{ dollars}
\]

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the problem:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
3. Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).
4. In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \).
5. The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
6. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]
7. We know the total savings for the month is $1125, so:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
9. The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   - Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
   - Total cost of apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

2. **Calculate the cost of the oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
   - Total cost of oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

3. **Calculate the cost of the peaches:**

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars, with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost for Daniel's school supplies with the given discount.

First, we calculate the cost of each item:
- Five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator: \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set: \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\)

Next, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop offers a 10% discount on all items, so we calculate the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. First, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:

Twice the time it takes in cold water is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this, we need to figure out the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's determine the percentage error:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
- The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to so that it reaches 520 degrees, considering the 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs in cents when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes the bottle can provide if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, it will give:
   \[
   120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost per pump. The bottle costs $24.00, so the cost per pump is:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]

3. Convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents:
   \[
   0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The clothing store is having a 30% off sale. The shirt he wants costs $25, and the pair of shorts costs $35. Let's figure out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Cost per month: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Cost per month for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. 

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. 

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000
\]
\[
42000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked individually and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
- Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
- Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To figure out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to break down the task into two parts: digging through the soil and digging through the clay.

1. **Digging through the soil:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through the soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Digging through the clay:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through the clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through the soil + Time to dig through the clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - This amount is half of what she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\).

4. **Calculate the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly hanger rental is $5,000.
3. The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve the problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. If Janey has 21 books and this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can represent the number of books Sally has as \( S \). The relationship can be written as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

First, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches:**
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - Current height = 20 feet
   - Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

2. **Determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches:**
   - Desired height = 600 inches
   - Current height = 240 inches
   - Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

3. **Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:**
   - Growth rate = 30 inches per day
   - Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

So, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure out how many toys James needs for the dog shelter.

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs join the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs. After buying these toys, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled to 24. This means he needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs. When he returns, he finds that 3 dogs have left the shelter, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs. Since he already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is:

4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 1 (final purchase) = 25

"To find out how much Skyler invested, let's break down the investments step by step.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount.
   - Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances's investment
   - Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first add up the signatures they already have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the original length of the dress be \( L \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \) cm.
3. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.
4. We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]
5. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

"Let's solve this step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and the combined ages of all five children add up to 44.

Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \( R + 7 \).

Since there are two twins and three triplets, the combined ages can be expressed as:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

So, the age of one of the triplets is 6 years. Now, we can find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost for the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rong's Monthly Savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Neil's Monthly Savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong.
   - First, calculate 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

3. **Total Savings Over Ten Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.
   - Rong's total savings over ten years: \( 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \).
   - Neil's total savings over ten years: \( 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \).

4. **Combined Total Savings:**
   - Add Rong's and Neil's total savings: \( 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \).

"To find the total price of the crate, let's break down the cost of each type of fruit:

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

   - Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:
     \[
     \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:**
   - The total goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - The remaining amount needed is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining amount:**
   - Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:
     \[
     \text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hours needed:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total water usage by the city:**
   - The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Calculate the industrial water usage:**
   - 80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the industrial water usage is \( 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \) of the river's total water.

3. **Calculate the non-industrial water usage:**
   - The non-industrial water usage is the remaining portion of the city's total water usage.
   - This is \( 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \) of the river's total water.

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

"Sure, let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Sure, let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with her $6.00, considering the deal at the ice cream parlor.

Each scoop costs $1.50, and the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. 

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Candy:**
   - Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

3. **Total Days:**
   - Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

4. **Total Candy Consumed:**
   - Ginger's total consumption in 14 days: \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy's total consumption in 14 days: \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \)

5. **Remaining Candy:**
   - Ginger's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \)

6. **Difference in Remaining Candy:**
   - The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger: \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \)

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To figure out how many windows Hannah smashed, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Each gallon jar costs $5, so the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon jar costs $3, so the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

- Sunday: 5 hours
- Total: 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, I account for the time I spend reading:
- Reading: 3 hours

So, the remaining time after reading is:
- Remaining time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours

I play video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
- Video games: 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, I subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time I spend playing soccer:
- Time spent playing soccer: 9 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of my weekend spent playing soccer, I use the formula:
- Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

So, the percentage of my weekend that I spend playing soccer is:
50%"
"Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of his pencils to Brandon, which means:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ pencils} \]

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils} \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \text{ pencils} \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony was left with:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils} \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To figure out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to consider both the time he spends traveling and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the travel time. Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back, making the total distance 300 miles. He drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time it takes to travel 300 miles at 75 mph is:

\[
\text{Travel Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours.

So, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Travel Time} + \text{Time at Museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the journey into the driving and hiking parts and calculate the distance for each.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

2. **Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

3. **Calculate Emma's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30T \)
   - Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

4. **Calculate Ava's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
   - Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

5. **Find the Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
   - Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

"To solve this, let's break it down:

- For 5 days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times each day.
- For 2 other days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days, which means 6 times each day.

First, calculate the total rides for the 5 usual days:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, calculate the total rides for the 2 special days:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, add the rides from the usual days and the special days:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To earn the video game achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 

First, let's calculate how many hours she plays in the first 2 weeks:
- She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).
- \(0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}\).

Next, let's calculate how many hours she plays in the following week:
- She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).
- \(2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}\).

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
- \(7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}\).

To find out how many more hours she needs to play to reach 30 hours:
- \(30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours}\).

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **First Car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second Car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the tea consumed by both groups:

"To figure out how many branches Felix climbed on average each day, we need to start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he charges $0.25 for each branch and he made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"To solve this, let's break down the ingredients and their relationships:

- Let the amount of citrus zest be \( z \) ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Let's solve this step by step. We know the total number of Magic Cards is 341. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards can be expressed as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey and then add them together.

First, Mason travels for 4 hours at a rate of 8 miles per hour. The distance he covers in this part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same rate of 8 miles per hour. The distance he covers in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To figure out how much money I have in my purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in my old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
- I have been paid $150 for my part-time job.
- My mom gives me $80.
- I still need $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money I have in my purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money I have is the sum of my purse money, my part-time job earnings, and the money from my mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, I have $120 in my purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, let's start by calculating the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

First, we calculate the slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down:

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the total milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day, so the additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.
4. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows required is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, I'll calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then add them together.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, I'll sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how much more money Gabriel needs to buy his car and phone.

First, let's add up the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- The car costs $10,000.
- The phone costs $800.
- So, the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Next, let's see how much money Gabriel already has:
- He has $5,000 from working on weekends.
- His brother gave him $200.
- So, the total amount he has is $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
- $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which means he has:
   \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. He buys six squirt guns, each costing $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

3. He also buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
   \[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

4. The total amount spent is:
   \[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

5. To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is:

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, I'll start by calculating the total time available for performances, excluding the intermission. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 110 minutes left for the performances.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group. 

To find out how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes, I divide 110 by 10:

\[ 110 \div 10 = 11 \]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest investment, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P + (P \times r \times t) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. This means the interest rate \( r \) is \( \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \) or 75%.
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now, let's calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
\[ I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ I = 675 \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 675 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of:

"Let's solve this step by step. 

I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is \( x \), then my brother's age is \( x + 3 \).

I am also 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is \( x - 2 \).

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

- \( S + A + F = 85 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
- \( S = (F - 12) + 25 \)
- \( S = F + 13 \)

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost of Water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

3. **Cost for 3 Bottles of Soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Cost for 2 Bottles of Water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total Cost:**

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many glasses of lemonade the boys sold in total. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses. Julie sold 14 glasses, so the boys together sold:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to determine in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of the items Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples} \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.
3. The total duration of the final concert is given as 65 minutes.
4. Therefore, the equation for the final concert duration is:
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
5. Subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 50

6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many microphones won't fit into pairs. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't find a space, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Each pair consists of 2 microphones, so the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and assuming the payment is for all the times she mowed his lawn, \( J \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

- First week: She mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- Second week: She mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed his lawn, and assuming the rate is consistent, the total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 9J \times \left(\frac{6}{J}\right) = 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - Adding the material needed for both types of masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

"To find the average price per ticket that I paid, I need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets I bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets:
- I saw 9 movies, and I watched each one 3 times.
- So, the total number of tickets is 9 movies * 3 times/movie = 27 tickets.

Next, I'll divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total number of tickets = 27

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 = $8

So, the average price I paid per ticket is $8.

"To figure out how much free time Harold has, let's break down his daily activities:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Duncan's current age is 60.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D \)
- Adam's current age as \( A \)

From the problem, we know:
\[ D = 60 \]

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour:**
   - Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - This means he completes \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) packages per hour.

2. **Determine his hourly earnings:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
   - Therefore, his hourly earnings are \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \) dollars per hour.

3. **Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:**
   - He works 8 hours a day.
   - His total earnings for the day are \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

So, Colby earns 64 dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. Since a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long, we calculate:
   \[
   45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles}
   \]

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To figure out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total distance Jon drives in a 30-day month:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine how many tune-ups are required based on the 1000-mile interval:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To solve this, let's break down the expenses Julia and Nadine made:

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, each at $7, is:
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Adding these expenses together gives us the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100

\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, let's add this to the initial 12-hour cost:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours, we subtract the total cost of his stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hay for the goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. **Hay for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. **Total hay needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem. Let's calculate how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops.

First, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of crop:

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam can be sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato can be sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, let's add up the earnings from all the crops:

- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To find the total commission I will earn, I need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- I get a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \(5 \times 0.10 = 0.50\) dollars.
- I sell 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- I get an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \(15 \times 0.08 = 1.20\) dollars.
- I sell 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \(10 \times 1.20 = 12.00\) dollars.

Finally, I add the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Points**: The team scored a total of 45 points.
2. **Bahati's Points**: Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati,
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo,
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract these 6 spoons from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
2. Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon:
  \[
  A + S + X = 339
  \]
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
  \[
  X = S + 5
  \]
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
  \[
  S = 4A - 13
  \]

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, I'll calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

Next, I'll calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance traveled north: \(36 \text{ miles}\).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To find out how long it will take me to string all the racquets, I need to calculate the total time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid set: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, I sum the total times for all types of stringing:
\[ 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \] minutes

So, it will take me 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"To figure out how much John paid for the phones, let's break it down:

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
\[ 600 + 600 + 300 + 300 = 1800 \]

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Now, to find the total number of players on both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats needed is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of:
   \[
   2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
   \]
3. After giving away 4 boxes, she has:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]
4. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
   \]
5. The number of boxes she sold is:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
   \]
6. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"To find the total number of states in both India and the USA, we start by noting that the USA has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

First, we calculate half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"To figure out how many hours Tyler needs to work, let's first calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, then Jerry has \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries.
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, let's break down the sales and calculate the earnings step by step.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation.

First, let's break down the problem:

1. Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
2. She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
3. Her vacation lasts for 8 days.
4. Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use:

- Each day, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles she will need:

- Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, she will need \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age in 5 years:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine Emil's dad's age in 5 years:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine Emil's dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine Emil's brother's age in 5 years:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how many beads Adrianne has collected for her bracelets.

Adrianne received 20 metallic beads from her mother. Her sister was quite generous and gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means she received 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend also contributed by giving her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add all the beads together:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To figure out how much Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Petunias for One Basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines for One Basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total Cost for One Basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total Cost for All 5 Baskets:**

"Sure, let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To figure out how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Jessica saves each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly income:

\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we calculate how much she saves in a year:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy:

\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since I can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp. I can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so the time to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time to peel and the time to sauté gives us the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take me 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem about the three little wolves who howl at the moon.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - So, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - So, Igneous' howl duration is \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - The total combined howl duration is \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) + \( 60 \) seconds (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the combined howl duration in minutes is \( \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \) minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from 5:00 pm.

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes to hours:
180 minutes = 3 hours

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the entire process. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find out the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, let's break down the costs and the frequency of the sessions:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. The studio has 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. We assume a month has 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- Cost to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   - So, the number of female porcupines is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
     \[
     30 \times 4 = 120
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of babies born in a year is:
     \[
     120 \times 12 = 1440
     \]

4. **Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population:**
   - The initial population is 50.
   - Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
     \[
     50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet earns $10 per hour from her wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   - Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - Total earnings per week = $25 * 40 = $1,000

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   - Number of weeks = Down payment / Total earnings per week = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the money he has left after his other purchases.

Let's break it down:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you figure out how much money Suzanne has left after her sales and giving her sisters some money.

First, let's calculate how much Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes:
- She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she made 80 * 1 = $80 from cookies.
- She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she made 60 * 4 = $240 from cupcakes.

Adding these amounts together, her total earnings are:
80 + 240 = $320

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters:
- She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so she gave away 2 * 10 = $20.

Subtracting this from her total earnings:
320 - 20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To figure out the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give.

First, let's find the total number of seats available for friends and family:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]
\[ \text{Seats for graduates} = 950 \]
\[ \text{Seats for faculty} = 300 \]
\[ \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Next, we divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**
   - Becky: 10 slices
   - Jake: 7 slices
   - Silvia: 14 slices
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

The total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. James receives 80 emails a day.
2. 20% of these emails don't require a response, so 80% do require a response.
3. To find out how many emails require a response each day, we calculate 80% of 80 emails:
   \[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]
4. James responds to 64 emails each day.
5. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily number by 5:
   \[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage for the coupons, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of big coupons**: Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons}
   \]

2. **Cost of mailing small coupons**: Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Cost of mailing big coupons**: Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total number of trucks dispatched**: Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.
2. **Number of trucks with mechanical failures**: A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. 
   - Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks.
3. **Number of trucks that successfully delivered**: 
   - Number of trucks that successfully delivered = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
   - Number of trucks that successfully delivered = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.
4. **Total amount of fertiliser delivered**: Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
   - Total amount of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that successfully delivered \(\times\) Tons of fertiliser per truck
   - Total amount of fertiliser delivered = 15 \(\times\) 20 = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To figure out how much Dennis will spend on 6 pounds of butter, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants, as he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.

The grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get the next pound at half price. The regular price of butter is $4.00 per pound.

Let's calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion:

1. For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater.

First, we need to determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class
- 13 family members

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we account for the 4 people who said they could not come:
Total guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater has a base fee of $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the initial 20, there is an additional fee of $6.

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests:
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost for the party is:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - A dozen (12) roses cost $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses plus 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses at $2 each is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so the total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the total cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Melanie has been saving toothpicks for her sculpture. She saves 10 toothpicks each week. Over the past 12 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The sculpture requires 200 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save 80 more toothpicks is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

2. Next, we know that one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second. So, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

3. Since there are 5 springs, each working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by all 5 springs in 4 hours is:
   - 5 springs * 14,400 jellyfish/spring = 72,000 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, I'll start by calculating the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

So, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Total remaining sodas: 8
   - Shaken sodas left: 2
   - Unshaken sodas left: 6

   The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day at the office. Let's calculate the total time he spends on these activities over 5 days.

First, let's find out how much time Bobby spends on breaks each day:
- Each break is 15 minutes, and he takes 2 breaks, so:
  15 minutes/break * 2 breaks = 30 minutes of breaks per day.

Next, let's add the time he spends on lunch:
- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
- 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes per day.

Now, let's convert this to hours:
- 60 minutes = 1 hour per day.

Finally, let's calculate the total time over 5 days:
- 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate the distance Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, Micah ran:

\[ 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this amount from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. Sheila then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( T \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T}{15} = 6
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   T = 6 \times 15

"To find the number of girls in the school, we start by determining the total number of students. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers.
2. Half of the Earth's circumference is \( \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \).
3. Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.
4. To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day: \( \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \).

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)
   - \( S = 9 \)

4. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob starts with 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water:
- One mug is 33 degrees.
- The other mug is at an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T_2 \).

Donny mixes 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce of water from the unknown temperature mug. The final mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature of the water from the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).
- \( T_2 \) is the temperature of the water from the second mug (unknown).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Add the duration of the first song and the second song to get the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find out how much profit Linus was able to earn, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
   - He sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
   - Selling price = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the devices bought:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday.
   - Total number of devices = 2 + 4 = 6.
   - Total cost = 6 * $20 = $120.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the devices:**
   - Selling price of one device = $40.
   - Total revenue = 6 * $40 = $240.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's solve this step by step. We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \(x\).

Rissa's remaining money is:
\[ 15 - x \]

According to the problem, this is equal to \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \]

So, we have:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices is:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices is:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To figure out how long it will take for me to have 60 snowballs, I need to consider both the rate at which I can make snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - I can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made in one hour = Snowballs made - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made in one hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, I divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

So, it will take me 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current Age of John:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Time Frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.

3. **John's Age 20 Years Ago:**
   - 20 years ago, John was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between John's and Jim's Ages 20 Years Ago:**
   - 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \( J \) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 8 = 2J \).

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

6. **Jim's Current Age:**
   - Jim's current age is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -38 + 50 = +12 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any more bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -25 + 100 = +75 \) bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \) bandages
- Second day: \( -28 \) bandages
- Third day: \( +75 \) bandages

Total net change over three days:
\[ 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \] bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:
\[ 78 - 59 = 19 \]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Jason earned over the two-week period.

Let's break it down:

- For doing his laundry once, he earns $3.00.
- For cleaning his room once, he earns $1.50.
- For taking the trash out twice, he earns $0.75 per time, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he earns $0.50 per time, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add it all up:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishes) = $9.00

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we find the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The problem states: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as \( x \).

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
2. The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
3. If Karen gets both, she gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the manicure and pedicure.

First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. Since she has 10 fingers, the cost for the nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:

"Sure, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones.
2. It takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call.
3. We need to find out how many calls he handles in a 5-day work week.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Tim works in a week:
- He works 6 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
  \[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, let's find out how many minutes he works in a 5-day week:
- \[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 15-minute calls he can handle in 1800 minutes:
- \[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To help Phineas Frog return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel 200 yards, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time for each segment:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Adding these times together gives us the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To figure out how many lemons Tim will need, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
   - There are 10 2-legged animals.
   - Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs for 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

2. Next, calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
   - There are 15 4-legged animals.
   - Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs for 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

3. Now, add the total number of legs from both types of animals:
   - Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + 60 (from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs.

4. Finally, convert the total number of legs into pairs of legs:

"Hi there! I'm Fatima, and I'll help you solve this problem step by step.

First, let's figure out how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of doing his chores. Since he gets $6 each week, we multiply:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 cones is:
\[ 4 \, \text{cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total money:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide:

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we have:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
