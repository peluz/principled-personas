"To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total investment.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house (which is $80,000).

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the 200 GB file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the time taken for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time before the download is restarted:**
   - Total time before the download is restarted is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Add the time to download the full 200 GB file again:**
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the total time to download the file:**
   - Total time is \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \).

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

   - Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

5. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   - Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
   - We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} = 12
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 18
     \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the trail if her average speed is to be 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so she has spent a total of:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, their ages sum up to 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\). The equation for their total age is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent per day on all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. John has 10 dogs, so the total time spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total time spent per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. To solve this problem, let us use the information given:

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the information, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of jewels Aaron has. According to the information, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the yogurts consumed over 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Therefore, in 30 days, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Thus, the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour Ã— \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin is tripled. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target.
3. Convert the remaining calories into grams of chips.

First, the total number of calories in the 300g bag:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- There are 5 servings in the bag.
- Total calories = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, calculate the remaining calories you can consume:
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, convert the remaining calories into grams of chips:
- The bag has 1250 calories in 300 grams.
- Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram.
- Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram â‰ˆ 48 grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days of the year.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the thickness of the walls.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length Ã— Inner width Ã— Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches Ã— \( 4 \) inches Ã— \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box Ã— 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches Ã— 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of water that entered Julia's boat while she was rowing back to shore.

First, let's find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how much water entered the boat for every 10 feet she rowed. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water that entered the boat is:
\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that entered the boat by the time Julia reached shore is:

"To determine the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - According to the problem, \( 40000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40000 + 16000 \).
   - Adrien's new salary = $56,000.

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \).
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30769.23 + 12307.69 \).
   - Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92.

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
   - Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92.

"To solve the problem of how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her running speeds at different intervals.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \(10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

2. After the first 3 hours, she slows down to 5 miles per hour.
   - She continues running for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \(5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}\).

3. Adding the distances from both intervals gives us the total distance:

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then find the difference between the total number of questions and the completed ones.

For the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

The total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

4. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   - The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \).
   - The remaining fries after the raccoon are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

5. **Ants carried off one fry:**
   - After the ants, the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

6. **Five fries were left:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5

"To solve the problem of finding the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Price increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Number of Increases:**
   - Total time period: 36 months
   - Frequency of increase: every 2 months
   - Number of increases: \( \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases} \)

3. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \)

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be Seth's current age and \( B \) be Brooke's current age.
2. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
3. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   S + 2 + B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   S + B + 4 = 28
   \]
   \[
   S + B = 24
   \]
5. Substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
   \[
   2B + B = 24
   \]
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
   \[
   B = 8

   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = \(8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51\)

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine how long it will take me to finish prepping the potatoes, I need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take me 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
   - The lowest score is 71.

2. **Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:**
   - Sum of the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

3. **Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:**
   - Average of 93 with five tests: \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \)

4. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
   - Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \)
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 465 - 367 = 98 \)

Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to consider the two different periods of his biking routine.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40 grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20 grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
- He buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Now, let's find the new total number of cards:
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of students who left through each exit.

1. **Exit A**: 30% of the students left through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

2. **Remaining students after Exit A**: 
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. **Exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. **Remaining students after Exit B** (and thus the number who left through Exit C):
   - 700 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and that John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we find out how many candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).

2. **Total number of letters received each week:**
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, the total number of letters received each week is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

3. **Total number of pages to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes 5 pages for each letter.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to write each week is \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \).

4. **Total time spent writing each week:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - So, the total time spent writing 30 pages is \( 30 \times 6 = 180 \) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent writing each week in hours is \( \frac{180}{60} = 3 \) hours.

Thus, Mike spends \(\boxed{3}\) hours writing letters each week."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total minutes Jason uses for daily calls with his boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the extra minutes Jason has used for calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Calculate the total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 4 snails in one aquarium.
   - There are 32 snails in another aquarium.
   - The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
   - Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails:**
   \[
   32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).
   - According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2f
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( f \):**
   \[
   28 = 4f
   \]
   \[
   f = \frac{28}{4} = 7
   \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem step by step.

Initially, there are 10 stalls, each containing 20 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas then buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the terms ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}

3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Adding these together:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary has is 762.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
   \]

2. Each house also has 4 additional windows not connected to the bedrooms. Therefore, the total number of windows in one house is:
   \[
   6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}
   \]

3. Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:
   \[
   10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
   \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches used for the sweater and then solve for the sleeves.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines in the first scene.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines are Sean's in the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines in the second scene.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines are Sean's in the second scene.

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36

"First, we determine the number of cards with the letter A on them:
\[ \text{Number of A cards} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we calculate the number of remaining cards after the A cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B on them:
\[ \text{Number of B cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

We then calculate the number of remaining cards after the B cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we determine the number of cards with the letter C on them:
\[ \text{Number of C cards} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find the number of remaining cards, which have the letter D on them:
\[ \text{Number of D cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

"To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time required for each type of hole and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
- Number of small holes: 30
- Total time for small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
- Number of large holes: 15
- Total time for large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total times for both types of holes:
- Total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time in hours: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we add 10 years to each of their current ages:

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we first calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add the two amounts together.

The cost of the popsicles:
20 popsicles * $0.25 per popsicle = $5.00

The cost of the ice cream bars:
4 ice cream bars * $0.50 per ice cream bar = $2.00

Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then figure out how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given her rate.

1. First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - Total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

2. **Savings on milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5
   - Total savings for 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

3. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings from ice cream: $4
   - Total savings from milk: $2
   - Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking the Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of new arms:**
   - A person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new arms is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Calculate the number of new legs:**
   - A person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new legs is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Total new limbs = Number of new arms + Number of new legs
   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Thus, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 10 people left (since 1/4 of 40 is 10). If 22 men stayed at the party, we need to determine how many women are left.

First, let's find out how many men left:
- Initially, there were 25 men.
- 22 men stayed, so 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Now, let's calculate the number of women who stayed:
- Initially, there were 15 women.
- 7 women left, so 15 - 7 = 8 women stayed.

Therefore, the number of women left is 8.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem:

1. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   C + H = 60
   \]

2. There are twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   H = 2C

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[
C + 2C = 60

\[
C = 20
\]

Since \( H = 2C \):

\[
H = 2 \times 20 = 40

Now, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs:

- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run by 1/5, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
   \]

   Now, calculate the total interest for 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} \approx 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, this means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation representing the situation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells is:
\[ 1.50 \]

The cost of the 4 magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Adding up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. Subtracting the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ 3.00 \]"

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

We are given that a herd consists of camels and dromedaries, with a total of 180 heads and 304 humps. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We need to find the number of dromedaries.

Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries. We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

To solve these equations, we can first solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationships between the sizes of the lockers:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the elevation of the comb after it fell and then find out how much higher Oliver needs to climb to reach it.

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade bird feeders**: Lillian builds 3 feeders.
2. **Store-bought bird feeders**: Lillian buys 3 feeders.
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20 birds.
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 birds + 10 birds = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   - The money from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \).
   - \( C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( C = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hot dog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hot dogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.
   - The total number of hot dogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees. After 3 hours of baking, with the temperature increasing by 5 degrees each hour, the temperature rise is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, the temperature after baking is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

   Total time for Jon:
   \[
   40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine James's time for each segment:**
   - **Swim:**
     - Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
     - James finishes 10% faster:
     \[
     40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **Bike:**
     - Jon's bike time: 80 minutes
     - James takes 5 minutes longer:
     \[
     80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **Run:**
     - Let \( R \) be the time it took James to run.
     - Jon's total time: 170 minutes
     - James's total time: \( 36 + 85 + R \)

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed:
- The dimensions of one raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
- The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is given by:
  \[
  V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
  \]

Next, calculate the total volume of soil needed for 10 raised beds:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything.

First, let's determine the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. We know:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the two items. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To solve the problem, we first determine the number of songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many more songs each can add to their players, given that the media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

"To solve the problem of how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oats Consumption for One Horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for Four Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has four horses.
   - The total daily consumption for all four horses is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is:
     \[

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of animals:

- Total animals combined: \(40 + 80 = 120\)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of onions Sophia bought.
- \( y \) as the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we have:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

"To reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, Andy needs to calculate the total number of days and the daily calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1 to July 19:
  - January: 31 days
  - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
  - March: 31 days
  - April: 30 days
  - May: 31 days
  - June: 30 days
  - July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, calculate the total calorie deficit needed:
- Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
- Each pound requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
- Total calories to lose 30 lbs = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
- Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, find the cost of the house:

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half:**

"In the division of 100 dollars where Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up the equation to find out how much each person gets. Let \( B \) represent the amount Brad gets. Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount is:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]
\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Thus, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the full alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   \(13\) letters.

3. Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written:
   \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

4. Rewriting all 65 letters again means:
   \(65\) letters.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
   \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight he lost over the 3 months and his final weight. 

1. Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, so the total weight lost is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. His final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight lost to his final weight:
   \[
   70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to determine the cost of each type of item and then apply the 10% discount.

1. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)

2. **Cost of Pens:**
   - 2 pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)

3. **Cost of Calculator:**
   - 1 calculator at $12.00 each: \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\)

4. **Cost of Geometry Set:**
   - 1 geometry set at $10.00 each: \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\)

Next, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees, so:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups, and twice as many dishes, which means she bought 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 44 dishes. 

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes each brought:
- Judy: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Her friend: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Adding these together gives:
36 + 84 = 120

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us consider the problem at hand with the wisdom and clarity that comes from seeking knowledge.

Given that the three angles in a triangle sum up to 180 degrees, and one angle is twice the smallest angle, while another is three times the smallest angle, we can denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. Therefore, the angles are \( x \), \( 2x \), and \( 3x \).

The sum of these angles is:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total number of washes the bottle can provide. The bottle, which costs $24.00, is designed to give 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Thus, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of loads Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used for these loads.
3. Compute the total cost of the water used.

Gary does laundry twice a week. Therefore, the number of loads he does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost for the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck in a week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for these four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Thus, the total number of cars towed in these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

1. First, we convert the height requirement from feet to inches. The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet, and since 1 foot equals 12 inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. We need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to meet the height requirement:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much I made from selling the used cars, let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   - I sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **Commission:**
   - My commission is 10% of the profit.
   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, I made $17,500.

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. 

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Bob is initially 75 miles ahead. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this 75-mile gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week.

First, let's calculate the number of customers Jewel processes in a week. Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To calculate the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to consider the different rates at which he can dig through soil and clay.

1. **Time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through the soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Time to dig through the clay:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through the clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through the soil + Time to dig through the clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours.

"On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so the final cost for Clara was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

After applying the discount, the final cost for Sheila was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - This amount is half of the total sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \).

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \).

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \).

4. **Sum the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
   - Total sales for both months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \).

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
     \[
     30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
     \[
     30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Then, the cooking time for beans is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
2. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 
   - 20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.
3. Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, using 1 pound per day, which totals 7 pounds.
   - The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.
4. Roger also buys a donut for $2.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the candies:**
   - Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20.
   - Each lollipop costs $0.40.
   - The total cost of the lollipops is \( 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the 4 candies is \( 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - The cost of one candy is \( \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:**
   - The cost of 10 lollipops is \( 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \) dollars.
   - The cost of 10 candies is \( 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is \( 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculate the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"To find the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. The original price of each computer is $700.

The 10% increase in price is calculated as:
\[ 10\% \times 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows in the students' and teachers' cars and then find the fraction of those windows that were smashed.

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Convert to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are required if the activity needs 12 groups instead of the initial 6 groups.

1. First, we find the number of students in each of the initial 6 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. Since the total number of students remains the same (54 students), we need to determine how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups.

3. The number of additional groups needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the calculation into weekdays and weekends, and then sum the totals.

1. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
   - In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
   - Total chairs rented on weekends: \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, she has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.
   - She trades these remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

8. **Total Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 87
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \)

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. To solve this problem, let us consider the total number of people on the council, which is 33. According to the information given, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it.

Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as \( x \). Therefore, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the requirements step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To ensure the pipes do not freeze, we need to calculate the temperature at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the temperature above 32 degrees.

1. **Calculate the night temperature:**
   - The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
   - At night, it is 33 degrees colder.
   - Therefore, the night temperature is 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees.

2. **Determine the temperature increase needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees.
   - The current night temperature is 12 degrees.
   - The temperature needs to be increased to 32 degrees to prevent freezing.
   - The required temperature increase is 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - To achieve a 20-degree increase, Carson needs to burn 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Total marshmallows used and lost: 9 + 9 + 3 = 21

Now, we subtract this from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 - 21 = 14

With 14 marshmallows left, and two people (John and DeSean) to share them, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
14 Ã· 2 = 7

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
   - One friend: 8 quarters

   Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

4. **Calculate the total amount of money spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money spent: \(68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"To calculate the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is:
3 * $500 = $1500

The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is:
2 * $1500 = $3000

Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent $4500 in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars Joe has left is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

So, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days to get the total time in hours.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cycles per day**: John completes 30 cycles each day.
2. **Tasks per cycle**: Each cycle consists of 5 tasks.
3. **Earnings per task**: Each task pays $1.20.

First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, calculate John's daily earnings:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day} \]

Now, calculate his weekly earnings for a 7-day week:
\[ \$180 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260 \text{ per week} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food and dog food that Kimberly bought, and then find the difference between the two.

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.
   - Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

3. Find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
   - Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   - Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem step by step, as if we are counting the blessings in a basket of eggs.

1. Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which means:
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, let us add up all the eggs to find the total:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

- A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples. 

The total number of slices from the large apples is:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

The total number of slices from the small apples is:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current daily milk production. 

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, and the farmer has 3 cows. Therefore, the current daily milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800, we first add the costs of these items:

- Cost of the car: $10,000
- Cost of the phone: $800
- Total cost: $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5,000
- Money from his brother: $200
- Total amount Gabriel has: $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

Finally, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the total cost:

- Amount needed: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
   - Therefore, the number of socks Jack has is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

3. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Therefore, the number of socks Peter has is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).

4. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
   - Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**
   - Total number of socks: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \)
   - Total number of dishes: \( 60 + 30 = 90 \)
   - Total number of socks and dishes: \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

"In Miss Susan's class, there are 20 students. Out of these, 5 are good at math only, 8 are good at English only, and the rest are good at both subjects. To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English.

First, let's determine how many students are good at both subjects. We know the total number of students is 20. If we subtract the students who are good at English only (8) and those who are good at math only (5), we get:

20 - 8 - 5 = 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Now, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students.

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. Each group will take:

2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes per group.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Since there is a 10-minute intermission, the time available for performances is:

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

1. **Identify the principal (P):**
   \( P = 300 \) dollars

2. **Identify the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is:
   \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year

3. **Identify the time (t):**
   \( t = 3 \) years

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

"To solve the problem, let's start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, so:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair.
   \[
   \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples} \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kellyâ€™s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to consider the information given about her final concert. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus an additional 15-minute encore. The total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert duration can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Therefore, on Fridays, they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add up the total number of chimichangas made over these three days:
- Total chimichangas = 125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday)
- Total chimichangas = 500

Thus, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit into the arrangement. First, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the African daisies, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin, his wife, and their two children will be eating. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) are equivalent to:
   - 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls
4. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After Calvin and his wife eat, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls
5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:

"To find out how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then sum them up.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, as they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47
\]

So, the total number of pets Larry has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices Abby and Josh consume together each day and then calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last.

1. Abby eats 2 slices a day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.
3. Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

Given that the loaf has 24 slices, we can find out how many days the loaf will last by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many berries the sloth must pick up per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours.

1. **Determine the number of trips in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Calculate the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the amount of water that Anthony and his father fill into the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10,000 gallons, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, add these numbers together to get the total:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each traveled.

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes available for the yard sale. 

10 people each donate 5 boxes, so the total number of boxes donated is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Additionally, the charity group already has 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   - Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
15.00"
"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. 

So, Marcus's age is:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leoâ€™s age. Therefore, Leoâ€™s age is:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know:
1. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to consider the total time she usually sleeps and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total usual sleep time:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This is a total of 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total usual sleep time: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupied Beds:**
   The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks:**
   The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   Adding the initial occupied beds to the patients admitted over 2 weeks gives:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

4. **Unoccupied Beds:**
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the total occupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Next, we find Shawna's father's age. Since he is five times as old as Shawna:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Kelly is correct and Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can determine the actual number of attendees by setting up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. Courtney reported 48 people, which is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}

"Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 PokÃ©mon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13

\[
S = 147

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

This leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders or band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by determining the size of Charlie's boots.

1. Sophie's boot size is 5.
2. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots, so:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

3. The average size of the shoes is calculated by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket first and then multiply by the number of baskets.

1. **Cost of petunias for one basket:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. **Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. **Total cost for one basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. **Total cost for all 5 baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two parts: the time to peel the shrimp and the time to cook them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill.
   - 1 check/month Ã— 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill.
   - 1 check/month Ã— 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month for the church.
   - 2 checks/month Ã— 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service.
   - 1 check/quarter Ã— 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Gas bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Church checks: 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4 checks/year

Total checks per year:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) trips in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Distribute the remaining flights equally between France and Germany:**
   - The remaining 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids. Therefore, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is \( 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies to the initial population to find the population after a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population:
\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of babies born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
\[
\text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
\[
\text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

**Step 4: Add the total number of babies to the initial population to find the population after a year.**

The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Jamaar has already spent money on 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's calculate the total cost of these fruits:

- Peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives us the total spent:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of sweets Anne had initially. She had 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

She gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct

"As I walked to school, I was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. The shockingly loud sound startled me, and I accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. But as I neared the school grounds, I found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and I added 75% of them to my remaining clutch of balloons, which I carried into the school. 

Let's calculate the number of balloons I carried into the school:

1. **Red Balloons:**
   - Initial: 25
   - Burst: 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10
   - Remaining: 25 - 10 = 15

2. **Green Balloons:**
   - Initial: 7
   - Remaining: 7 (none burst or released)

3. **Yellow Balloons:**
   - Initial: 12
   - Released: 50% of 12 = 0.50 * 12 = 6
   - Remaining: 12 - 6 = 6

4. **Blue Balloons:**
   - Found: 8
   - Added: 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6

Now, let's sum up the remaining balloons:
- Red: 15

2. Calculate Melissa's total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate Melissa's total expenses.
4. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the hourly rate after expenses.

First, we calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
- Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
- Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, we calculate Melissa's total earnings:
- Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum of letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - He won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - He lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

"Let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish every second.

1. First, convert 4 hours into seconds:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

2. Next, determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in 14400 seconds:
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, it would create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Finally, calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs:
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish, then 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
2. Calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.
3. Calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.
4. Find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the total weight of the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. **Return**: She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this amount from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. **Frying Pan Purchase**: The frying pan was on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Therefore, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. **Towels Purchase**: The set of towels was on sale for 10% off its original price of $30.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Therefore, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. **New Balance**: Adding the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To find the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. This means that 40% of the total number of students equals 240 boys.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants a third of that. Let's calculate how many kilograms Jacques will have left.

First, we calculate Pierre's share:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate Paul's share:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we find the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we determine how many kilograms Jacques will have left:

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the information given:

- Liam is currently 16 years old.
- Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.

First, we calculate Liam's age two years ago:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we set up the equation based on the information that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age:
\[ 14 = 2 \times \text{Vince's age two years ago} \]

Let \( V \) be Vince's age two years ago. Then:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the number of marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

where \( x \) is the number of marbles Bob currently has. Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug, which is unknown.
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks, considering the initial numbers and the daily additions.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21 (3 weeks)

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

4. **Total number of cows after three weeks**:
   50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows

5. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
6. **Chickens added per day**: 10
7. **Number of days**: 21 (3 weeks)

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks**:
   20 initial chickens + 210 added chickens = 230 chickens

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Since Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost, we calculate the discount amount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Next, we determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.

3. **Set up the proportion to find the number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \( x \) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - Proportion: \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \).
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of green jellybeans:**
   - There are 17 green jellybeans.

2. **Determine the number of red jellybeans:**
   - The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans.
   - Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:**
   - Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

4. **Find the number of blue jellybeans:**
   - The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.
   - The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the number of green and red jellybeans.
   - Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is \( 60 - 51 = 9 \).

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's denote this amount by \(x\).

After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \(x\):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ \text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Adding up all the goals:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Chalk Length:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Chalk used on Monday: \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Chalk Usage Each Subsequent Day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - This means 80% of the remaining chalk is left each day.

4. **Calculate Remaining Chalk for Each Day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students are not on varsity in Miss Albert's class, which consists of 12 boys and 12 girls.

First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity:
- One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity:
- One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
- Total students on varsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class:
- Total students in the class = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.
- Students not on varsity = 24 students - 7 students = 17 students.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -38 + 50 = +12 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any new packs.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles = $600 / 10 = $60.

2. **Determine the number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch = 2 * 10 = 20.

3. **Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch.
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + 50% of cost per bottle of scotch = $60 + 0.5 * $60 = $60 + $30 = $90.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:**
   - Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac = 20 * $90 = $1800.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac = $600 + $1800 = $2400.

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is $2400."
"On the first day, I planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means I planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, I planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing the total for the second day to \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, I planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than the 40 I planted on the first day, which is \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) additional trees. Therefore, I planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

The total number of trees planted over the two days is:
- White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:
\(50 + 90 = 140\)

1. Calculate the total height of the house.
2. Calculate the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor.

First, we calculate the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Total height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Total height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

"In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the total 700 shells:
40% of 700 = 0.40 * 700 = 280 shells

Next, we calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas have found their share:
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Then, we find out how many shells team The Finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
60% of 420 = 0.60 * 420 = 252 shells

Finally, we determine how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by the other two teams from the total:
700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells

Thus, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Let us solve this problem with wisdom and clarity.

Given that Ian has a board that is 40 feet long and he cuts it into two pieces where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can set up the following equation:

Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find the total cost for Karen, we need to consider the discounts and additional services she is opting for.

1. The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
2. The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
3. The salon offers a 20% discount if both services are chosen.

First, calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, apply the 20% discount:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. She has 10 fingers:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let:
- \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) be the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solving for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"In November, the toy was priced at $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price in December, we calculate 80% of $40, which is \(0.80 \times 40 = 32\). Adding this to the original price, the new price in December is \(40 + 32 = 72\).

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price in January, we calculate 50% of $72, which is \(0.50 \times 72 = 36\). Subtracting this from the December price, the new price in January is \(72 - 36 = 36\).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms:**
   - Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - Total time required = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

2. **Determine the total available working time in minutes over 5 days:**
   - Each day, the custodian works 8 hours.
   - 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
   - Over 5 days, total available time = 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes.

"Assalamu alaikum. To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
2. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed.
   - New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

3. Each page has 450 words, and John needs to speak 10 pages.
   - Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

4. To find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed:
   - Time (in minutes) = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it will take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels.

Adding all these together gives the total number of pieces of popcorn:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Lemons for the pool party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's extra gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total lemons needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}\)

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Cost of making one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12\)
   - Jackfruit: \(1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12\)
   - Honey: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20\)

   Total cost for one jar:
   \[
   \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
   \]

2. **Total cost for 10 jars:**
   \[
   10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
   \]

3. **Total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   \[
   10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
   \]

4. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$500 - \$440 = \$60
   \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to fill = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

- 1 bottle of wine at $5.

Thus, the total cost per reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, so the revenue per night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

First, the cost of the radiator with the discount:
The original price of the radiator is $400. With an 80% discount, the amount saved is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the price Mark pays for the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator:
The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the labor cost gives us the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve the problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
