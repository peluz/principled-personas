"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Josh made.

1. **Initial Purchase and Repair Costs:**
   - Josh buys the house for $80,000.
   - He spends $50,000 on repairs.
   - Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

2. **Value Increase:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original value ($80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost.
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[
\boxed{70000}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:
\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

3. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

5. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

7. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

2. **Total Time Required:**
   - Using the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for Total Time:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Time Already Spent:**
   - Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

4. **Remaining Time:**
   - Remaining time to complete the trail = Total Time - Time Already Spent
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

5. **Remaining Distance:**
   - Total distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total Distance - Distance Already Covered
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

6. **Required Speed for Remaining Distance:**
   - Using the formula for speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \(6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. We need to find out how many games they won.

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of games won.
- \( L \) as the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To figure out how many tomatoes Freda used, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When cooked, the volume of the tomatoes is halved.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking was \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find the number of cans, we divide the initial volume by the volume per can: \( \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \).

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is \( 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \).

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

"Sure, let's calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3

"To solve this, let's start by finding Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%):
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in each test based on the time he had and his rate of completing questions.

For the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

So, the number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

So, the number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's define the number of queens as \( Q \).
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. After the pigeons, a raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one more fry.
6. Finally, 5 fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( x \).

After Dave ate 14 fries:
\[ x - 14 \]

After the seagull ate 7 fries:
\[ x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \]

After the pigeons ate 9 fries:
\[ x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \]

The raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries:
\[ \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30 \]
\[ \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \]
\[ \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \]

After the ants carried off one fry:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \]

We know that 5 fries were left:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries Dave bought is \( 48 \).

"Sure, let's calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means each increase is 20% of $20, which is $4.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, over 36 months, there will be 36 / 2 = 18 increases.

4. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

5. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

"To figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. **Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:**
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. **Calculate the total annual payment:**
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"Sure, let's calculate the total time Billy will need to prep the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

First, we need to determine the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To figure out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Total cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

2. **Calculate the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - Each gallon makes 20 glasses.
   - Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10.

3. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - Total revenue = $10 * \( G \).
   - Total cost = $5 * \( G \).
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Given profit = $25, we can write: $25 = $10 * \( G \) - $5 * \( G \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: $25 = $5 * \( G \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Total cost of lemons for 5 gallons = $3 * 5 = $15.

So, the amount spent on lemons is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. Here's the breakdown of the information:

1. **Rats:**
   - Rats are kept in 3 cages.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Jerry has a flock of chickens, and we need to figure out how many red chickens he has. Here's what we know:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the information given:
1. \( W = R + 2 \) (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
2. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so we can write the equation:
   \[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \(d\) and \(v\):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, let's find out how many Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

So, the total number of cards initially is:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]
- James buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:

1. The total number of students in the school hall is 1000.
2. 30% of the students went out through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students}
   \]
3. After 300 students left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700 \text{ students}
   \]
4. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \text{ students}
   \]
5. The rest of the students went out through exit C. To find this number, we subtract the students who went out through exits A and B from the total:
   \[
   1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2:
   \[
   \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

2. James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies:
   \[
   \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We do this by subtracting the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - So, the number of pen pals he still has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters he receives each week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of pages he needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time he spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have two aquariums:
- The first aquarium has 4 snails.
- The second aquarium has 32 snails.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

The problem states that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

2. Each house also has 4 additional windows not connected to the bedrooms. So, the total number of windows in one house is:
   \[
   6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}
   \]

3. Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:
   \[
   10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To figure out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the total number of stitches for the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"Sure, let's figure this out together! If the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20 now, in 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages. That means we add 10 + 10 to the current sum of 20.

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To figure out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods are required for her to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \]

Since each period is 4 weeks, the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ 4 \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

A football team has 105 members. There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and there is half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense. We need to find out how many players are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To figure out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, let's start by determining how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To figure out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the ice cubes and the cream she adds. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees, so we first calculate the number of ice cubes needed:

\[
\text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it:

\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
\]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening is:

\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
- The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Calculate the new total distance Tyson runs each day.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, let's find the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000 meters"

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then determine the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"Sure, let's calculate the distances each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the remaining land represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. He also did an additional 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he found out he only had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can add up the steps he had already taken and the steps he had left to reach his goal, and then subtract this total from his daily goal.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000

Total steps taken before the jog + steps taken during the jog + steps left after the jog = 10,000
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000

Solving for the steps during the jog:
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during jog = 10,000
steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000

\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total payment for all 40 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

First, calculate the monthly payment for one employee (same as in May):
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total payment for the 30 remaining employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 168000 \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Tim spent in total on the fireworks.

1. **Cost of the first package of fireworks:** $400
2. **Cost of the second package of fireworks:** $400 \times 2 = $800
3. **Total cost of the first and second packages before discount:** $400 + $800 = $1200
4. **Discount on the first and second packages:** 20% of $1200 = $1200 \times 0.20 = $240
5. **Total cost of the first and second packages after discount:** $1200 - $240 = $960
6. **Cost of the finale firework:** $150
7. **Total amount spent:** $960 + $150 = $1110

So, Tim spent a total of $1110 on the fireworks.

"To figure out how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, let's break it down:

1. Shannon eats 2 cookies each night.
2. She wants to have enough cookies for 30 days.
3. So, the total number of cookies she needs is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]
4. Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies (12 cookies), we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% (or 0.01).

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
   \]

2. Determine how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the exploding candles have this defect.

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
   \]

So, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We know the following:
- The total number of heads (animals) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"Sure, let's calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip in Europe.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, Timothy's locker is 2 times the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's elevation, so the comb landed at:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"Sure, let's calculate the total capital Mr. Josue has now. 

He initially had $5000. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice that amount, which is $8000. 

So, the total capital is:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and each takes 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats leave, the number of cats remaining on the rock is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock after some run after the mouse is:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month:
   \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars

2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month:
   \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars

3. For the remaining 10 months (since 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months), the cost is $14 per month:
   \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for 2 years:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"Sure, let's figure out how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.

Lillian has:
- 3 homemade bird feeders, each attracting 30 birds (20 birds + 10 more birds than the store-bought ones).
- 3 store-bought bird feeders, each attracting 20 birds.

First, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He also wants to have $50 left for spending cash, so he needs a total of $150. He sells each card for $1.5.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \]

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order with the discount applied.

First, we add up the cost of all the items:
- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since 15 gallons are divided equally into 5 containers:
   \[
   \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Next, we need to determine how many gallons are in 1/4 of a container:
   \[
   \text{Gallons for 1/4 of a container} = \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Finally, we convert the gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints:
   \[
   \text{Pints} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \(0.01 \times 5 = 0.05\) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \(5 - 0.05 = 4.95\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \(4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**

"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Wayne's Drive Time:**
   - Wayne's drive from his hotel to the theater takes 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive from her apartment to the theater takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"Sure, let's calculate the cost of the potting soil for Bob's raised beds.

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

So, for one raised bed:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

1920"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's sum up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To figure out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the total weight of each type of feed and then see how many trips are required given the truck's capacity.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that this combined length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
6 inches = 6 / 12 feet = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, the combined length is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage, we use the formula:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost Per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the order they are stacked. 

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's set up the equations for each venue and solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many insects as Bodhi. Let's use these clues to find out how many insects each person found.

1. Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \).
2. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. Since David found half as many insects as Bodhi, Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total number of insects collected:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To find out how much yarn they used together, we need to add these fractions.

First, let's convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Sure, let's calculate how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass.

1. First, we need to find out how many bus trips Janet takes in a week:
   - She takes 2 bus trips each day.
   - She does this 5 days a week.
   - So, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of these bus trips:
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 10 trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

3. Now, we compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass:
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

4. Finally, we calculate the savings:
   - Savings = Total cost of bus trips - Cost of the weekly bus pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for. 

First, let's determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit:
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. The total amount he paid was $48. To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
   \]

2. Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
4. The combined cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
5. The remaining amount, which is the cost of the 2 monitors, is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

"To figure out how much you end up paying, let's break it down:

1. The dinner bill is $50.
2. Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the bill. 
   - 20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.
3. The total amount including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60.
4. Since the check is split evenly, each person would normally pay $50 / 2 = $25.
5. However, you are responsible for the entire tip, so you pay $25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35.

So, you end up paying $35.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break this down:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
3. In the first half, he saves \( 15x \) in total.
4. In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) each day, so he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) in total.
5. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).
6. We know the total savings should be $1125, so we set up the equation: \( 45x = 1125 \).
7. Solving for \( x \): \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's current age as \( N \).

In 7 years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old. According to the problem, Shiloh's age in 7 years (51) will be three times the nephew's age in 7 years:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To figure out the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to understand the percentage by which her oven is off. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

First, let's calculate the percentage increase:
- The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage increase is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set for a desired actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

Given:
- The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- The total number of jelly beans is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:

- The third angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"Sure, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy with the coins he has.

First, let's convert all the coins into cents:
- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to determine the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"Sure, let's calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa can make together in 12 hours.

First, we determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"Sure, let's go through this step by step:

1. Howard spends $8 on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent over the three days:
- Total spent = $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
- $100 - $88 = $12

So, the amount of money Howard has left is $12.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To figure out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the tires rotate \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, the total number of rotations per month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of rotations per year is \( 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \) rotations.

4. **Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.
   - So, the number of years is \( \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \) years.

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To figure out the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, we first need to understand how many washes she can get from the bottle. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The jumbo bottle costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Sure, let's figure out how much money Joe will have left after his purchase.

First, we need to find the total cost of the shirt and the shorts before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"Sure, let's calculate the amount of butter Juan will need for his croissants.

1. First, we need to find out how much butter is required for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants will require \( 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \) pound of butter.

2. Next, we need to determine the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - Since 1 pound of butter is needed per day, for 7 days, the total amount of butter required is \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost of John's research step by step.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the initial 5 months: $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - The total research time is 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months.
   - The additional months beyond the initial 5 months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - The funding per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding.
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to look at the difference in their speeds and the distance between them. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure the cost per class doesn't exceed $10. 

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"Sure, let's calculate the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that Lee has only sheep and geese on his farm. Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

where \( S \) is the number of books Sally has. 

First, we subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. The growth needed is:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for 12 dogs.
3. After buying these toys, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there are 24 dogs.
4. He needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.
5. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs.
6. He already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), so he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is:

4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 1 (final purchase) = 25

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount of $1200:
\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Finally, we find out how much Skyler invested, which is the rest of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To find the original length of the dress, let's start by setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress in centimeters.

1. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length is:
   \[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

2. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
   \[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):

1. Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[ 1.5L = 120 \]

2. Divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Over ten years, which is 120 months, Rong's total savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years, Neil's total savings are:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To find the total price of the crate, let's break down the cost of each type of fruit:

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To figure out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to break down the problem into a few steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks the city will set off:
- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.
- So, the total number of fireworks the city will set off is \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks.

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her house:
- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- So, the number of fireworks she can see from the city's display is \( 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \) fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah has 3 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.
- So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

Finally, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135 fireworks.

2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this, we first need to divide the $100 according to the ratio 3:2 between Gerald and Julia.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he gets 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share is 2 parts, so she gets 2 * $20 = $40.

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

So, Gerald has $50 left."
"To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To figure out how many hours in total the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the hourly rate of fundraising:**
   - They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
   - So, the amount raised per hour is:
     \[
     \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount needed:**
   - The total goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - The remaining amount needed is:
     \[
     6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of additional hours needed:**
   - Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining $4200 is:
     \[
     \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hours needed:**
   - They have already fundraised for 3 hours.
   - Adding the additional hours needed:
     \[
     3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find out how much of the total river water this is, we calculate:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
   So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes.
3. To find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Therefore, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"Sure, let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount using Marcus' loyalty card:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Sure, let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with her $6.00, considering the deal at the ice cream parlor.

Each scoop costs $1.50, and the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. 

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches and add the extra inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

"To figure out how many windows Hannah smashed, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, let's start by adding up all the spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

First, calculate the total number of spools:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, calculate the total number of blue spools:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Convert to a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of blue spools is 40%.

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white. He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To make sure the pipes don't freeze, Carson needs to keep the house warm enough. Let's figure out how many logs he needs to burn.

1. First, we need to find out how cold it gets at night. If it's 45 degrees during the day and 33 degrees colder at night, the night temperature is:
   - 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. The pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees. So, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The temperature increase needed is:
   - 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

3. Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:
   - 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Determine the distance each car travels in 2 hours:**
   - The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
     - Distance = Speed × Time
     - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles
   - The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.
     - Distance = Speed × Time
     - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the difference in distance between the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Glass Chips**: Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Chips per Square Inch**: It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic.
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the Mosaic**: Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:**
   Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts of tea.
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:**
   Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea.
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. **Add the tea consumed by both groups of students:**
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}

"To figure out how many branches Felix climbed on average each day, we need to start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he charges $0.25 for each branch and made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces.
2. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
4. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, we know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your question about Mason's bike journey.

Mason is traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours initially, and then after a rest, he continues for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

   \]

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[

"To figure out how much money I have in my purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in my old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- I have $150 from my part-time job.
- My mom gives me $80.
- I still need $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money I have in my purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money I have is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, I have $120 in my purse.

"Sure, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

First, we calculate the slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down:

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Sure, let's figure out how much more money Gabriel needs to buy the car and the phone.

1. First, we add up the cost of the car and the phone:
   - Car: $10000
   - Phone: $800
   - Total cost: $10000 + $800 = $10800

2. Next, we add up the money Gabriel already has:
   - From working on weekends: $5000
   - From his brother: $200
   - Total amount Gabriel has: $5000 + $200 = $5200

3. Finally, we subtract the total amount Gabriel has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:
   - Amount needed: $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600.

\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

Now, we can find the number of books Fawn has:
\[ F = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

"Sure, let's break down the costs of Kelly's grocery items:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Since she has 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, let's break down the information given:

1. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we need to determine the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we need to find the speed of a whirligig. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and assuming the payment is for all the times she mowed his lawn, \( J \) must be 1 (since the problem doesn't specify a rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

Now, let's calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:
- Joe's lawn: \( J = 1 \) time
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J = 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times

Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed lawns, and she mowed lawns 9 times, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales:
- Total earnings = $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns = $6
- Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74

So, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- This means each small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, Jo will need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- This means each large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, Jo will need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We know Duncan's current age is 60. Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

First, we express Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Next, we express Adam's age four years ago:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) is two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons. We need to find out how many yellow balloons there were.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \). The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times y \text{ yellow balloons} = 3y \text{ pieces} \]

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, let's break down the expenses and then determine the total amount of allowance they each received.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you figure out how many pets Larry has. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We are given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( L \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the information given:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[ L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is:

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, let's add this to the initial 12-hour cost:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours, we subtract the total cost of his stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"Sure, let's calculate the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock.

1. **Hay for the goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total hay needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time for the initial swimming:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, let's break down the calculations for each type of newspaper:

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy: \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy: \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know the following:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- \( X \) as the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, I'll calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

Next, I'll calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance traveled north: \(36 \text{ miles}\).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To figure out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you figure out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation.

First, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Sunscreen Usage:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - So, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

2. **Total Sunscreen Usage Over 8 Days:**
   - She will be on vacation for 8 days.

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find out how many football players there are, we calculate 20% of 30:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

So, there are 6 football players. 

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"Sure, let's figure out how much Pat will spend to fill up her flower bed.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"Sure, let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the remaining soil.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day. According to the problem, three-quarters of these flights go to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F \div 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \]

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: 10 years

Let's denote Wilfred's age as \( W \). The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 \]

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon is to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from 5:00 pm.

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the time:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes to hours:
180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the entire process. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"Sure, let's work through this step by step to find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Identify the prices:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of animals sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x = 12x \).
   - The total earnings from all sales is \( 8x + 12x = 20x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

"To figure out the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he might not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there's a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many seats are available for friends and family. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats.
2. We subtract the seats allocated for graduates and faculty:
   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

So, the calculation for the seats available for friends and family is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

3. Now, we need to divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
160 square feet of fabric."

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

The second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls over three sets. Let's denote the number of balls he retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

1. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together, and the total time taken was 98 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. Let's denote the time Donovan took as \( D \) minutes. Therefore, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both parts is given by:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

1. First, we need to figure out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we divide 2000 by 10:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the orchard earned $1000.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To figure out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to do a couple of calculations.

First, we know the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so:
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so:
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}

"To figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bottles needed per person for 100% of their daily energy needs:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - Therefore, to cover 100%, a person needs \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles per day.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles per day.

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Hi there! I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50:
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.
   - He now has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

3. After a month, he sells another 1/4 of his original land for $30:
   - 1/4 of the original 80 square meters is 20 square meters.
   - So, he sells 20 square meters for $30.
   - He now has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

4. He then sells the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
   - The total from this sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60

Total earnings = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

"Sure, let's calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's solve this step by step!

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, we'll clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Then, we'll subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices is:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total cheese pizza slices needed: 36 slices.

The number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her 6 friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices is:

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices needed: 24 slices.

The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs made per hour:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which totals 8 snowballs melted in an hour.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in an hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

2. **Calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs:**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -38 + 50 = +12 \)

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any more bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -28 \)

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - Net change in bandages: \( -25 + 100 = +75 \)

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \)
- Second day: \( -28 \)
- Third day: \( +75 \)

Total net change: \( 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \)

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. To find out how many bandages they started with, we subtract the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages: \( 78 - 59 = 19 \)

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost After Price Increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He makes a cut so that he has two pieces, with the longer piece being 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To figure out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

1. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write:
   \[
   S = M + 12
   \]
   where \( S \) is the number of paintings Shelley has and \( M \) is the number of paintings Samantha has. Given \( M = 27 \):
   \[
   S = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]

2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so:
   \[
   S = K + 8
   \]
   We already found that \( S = 39 \), so:
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]

3. Solving for \( K \):
   \[
   K = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[ B = 5S - 4 \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[ S + B = 116 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the first equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"Sure, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones.
2. It takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call.
3. First, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 6 hours is equal to:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Next, we divide the total minutes in a workday by the time it takes to handle one call:
   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day}
   \]
5. Tim works 5 days a week, so the total number of calls he handles in a week is:
   \[
   24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week}
   \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. The total number of animals: \( c + k = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
