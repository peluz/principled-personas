"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. 

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses a total of:
3 + 4 = 7 eggs

This means the number of eggs left for her to sell is:
16 - 7 = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. So, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for a robe, we need to add up the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber, so that's 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add them together:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
3"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of the House:**
   Josh buys the house for $80,000.

2. **Cost of Repairs:**
   He spends $50,000 on repairs.

3. **Total Cost:**
   The total cost is the sum of the purchase price and the repair costs:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

4. **Increase in Value:**
   The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find out how much the value increased, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house:
   \[
   150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]

5. **New Value of the House:**
   The new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
   \[
   80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

6. **Profit:**
   The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
   \[
   200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
   \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000. 

\[
\boxed{70000}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Next, we calculate how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs 540 meters a week.

540"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to know how much feed all the chickens need in a day. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens. So, we multiply 3 cups by 20 chickens:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Next, we need to see how much feed Wendi has already given. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much more feed is needed for the final meal. We subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that one glass costs $5. But every second glass is only 60% of that price. So, let's calculate the price of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. If we look at it in pairs, each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3. So, the cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since 16 glasses make 8 pairs, we need to multiply the cost of one pair by 8:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. 

Next, we're told that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
So, Charleston has 80 sheep.

Then, we're told that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \]
So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the number of sheep in each city:
\[ 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
260"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - The file is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time so far is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the full file again:**
   - The full file is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Add the time to download the full file again to the total time:**
   - Total time is \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:
160"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for the first part of the trip:

\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. Here's what happens during those 4 hours:

1. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all.
2. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 miles per hour. So, the distance he covers in this time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

3. For the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 miles per hour. So, the distance he covers in this time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we need to find out how far he is from home. He initially traveled 180 miles away, and he traveled 135 miles back home. So, the distance from home is:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza made this week.

First, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours. She earns $10 per hour for these hours:
- 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
- Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour
- 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to get her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - So, \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, find 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Then, subtract this from 180: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Add up the downloads from all three months: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs for all the pastries:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars

So, the total cost of the pastries is $694.

694"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Carlos spends and earns each year.

1. **Initial Cost to Plant the Tree**: $90
2. **Lemons per Year**: 7
3. **Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed the Tree**: $3

Now, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \]

Next, we subtract the annual cost to water and feed the tree from the annual revenue to find the net profit each year:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to see how many years it takes for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

1. **First, let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.**

2. **At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners.**
   - So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
   - After the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
   - Simplifying that, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. **At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.**
   - So, after the red house, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. **At the orange house, she sold half of what was left.**
   - So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
   - After the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

5. **We know that after all the sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.**
   - So, \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \).

6. **Let's solve this equation:**
   - First, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Next, add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} = 12
     \]
   - Finally, multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 18
     \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we have 20 students in the dance class. 

1. **Contemporary Dance:**
   - 20% of the students are in contemporary dance.
   - 20% of 20 students is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students.

2. **Remaining Students:**
   - After 4 students are in contemporary dance, we have \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students left.

3. **Jazz Dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students are in jazz dance.
   - 25% of 16 students is \( 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students.

4. **Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - The rest of the students are in hip-hop dance.
   - After accounting for the students in contemporary and jazz dance, we have \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students left for hip-hop dance.

Now, to find the percentage of the entire class that is in hip-hop dance:
- The number of students in hip-hop dance is 12.
- The total number of students is 20.
- The percentage is \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \).

So, the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
60%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate how much profit the merchant would make from each option.

### Jewelry
- The jewelry costs $5,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
- To find the profit, we multiply the cost by the percentage increase:
  \[
  5000 \times 0.025 = 125
  \]
- So, the profit from the jewelry is $125.

### Electronic Gadgets
- The electronic gadgets cost $8,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
- To find the profit, we multiply the cost by the percentage increase:
  \[
  8000 \times 0.012 = 96
  \]
- So, the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

### Comparing the Profits
- The profit from the jewelry is $125.
- The profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The maximum profit the merchant can make is:
125"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a math problem we did in high school. We have two trains that start from the same place and travel in two different directions over two days. On the first day, they both go 80 miles to the west. The next day, they both go 150 miles to the north. 

To find out how far each train traveled in total, we just need to add the miles they traveled each day. So, for each train, it's 80 miles on the first day plus 150 miles on the second day.

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, each train traveled 230 miles in total over the two days.

230 miles"
"Okay, let's figure out Jill's annual salary step by step.

First, we need to find out how much she makes each week from both her jobs.

1. **Teaching:**
   - She teaches for 35 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $20 per hour.
   - So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
     \[
     35 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cheerleading Coaching:**
   - She coaches for 15 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $30 per hour.
   - So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
     \[
     15 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 450 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, we add her weekly earnings from both jobs to find her total weekly earnings:
\[
700 \text{ dollars} + 450 \text{ dollars} = 1150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much she makes in a year. She works 50 weeks a year, so:
\[
1150 \text{ dollars/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks} = 57500 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[
57500 \text{ dollars}
\]

57500"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks, so 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she uses: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

7"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the rest of the trail to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to figure out the total time she should take to complete the 12 miles.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

We want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles. So:
\[ 4 \text{ miles per hour} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

To find the total time, we rearrange the formula:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking 6 miles. So, she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the speed formula again:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we only have 9 liters left. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, we mix the 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond is:
   \[ 31 + 6 = 37 \] years old.
3. Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old.
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:
   \[ 37 - 23 = 14 \]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. 

14"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. 

- The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD. So, 3 customers times 1 DVD each equals 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs. So, 2 customers times 2 DVDs each equals 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. So, 3 customers times 0 DVDs each equals 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"Okay, so if a candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, and it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, that's 4 hours. So, you just multiply the number of hours by how much it melts each hour:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which was after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75 \times \text{original price} = 19.50 \]

Now, to find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:
\[ \text{original price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Let's do the division:
\[ \text{original price} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

26.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items Marie bought, except for the pizza.

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so that's 5 * 3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so that's 4 * 1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
12 + 15 + 6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
50 - 33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie bought, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
17 / 8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items.

First, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing:

1. **Shorts:**
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50 per pair = $49.50.

2. **Pants:**
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50 per pair = $67.50.

3. **Shoes:**
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.00.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs × $42.00 per pair = $126.00.

Now, we add up the total costs for all the items:

- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $243.00 on all the clothing items.

243"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Find out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - So, in 60 days, she will eat:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs:**
   - Each carton has 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16 on ice cream after 60 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Henry went on a 60-mile bike trip and made two stops. 

1. He first stopped after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, 15 miles before the end means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 - 15 = 45).

To find out how many miles he traveled between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the cost of one pair of high heels is $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so that's \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of both pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the boots cost \( B \) dollars, then:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years. Together, their ages add up to 162.

1. Let's say Darrell's age is 7 parts and Allen's age is 11 parts. So, the total number of parts is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
2. Since the total age is 162, each part is equal to 162 divided by 18:
   \[
   \text{Each part} = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
3. Now, we can find Darrell's age by multiplying his parts by 9:
   \[
   \text{Darrell's age} = 7 \times 9 = 63
   \]
4. Similarly, we can find Allen's age by multiplying his parts by 9:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age} = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
5. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first friend guesses there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guesses 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we calculate 0.25 times 80, which is 20. Adding 20 to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend guesses 100 jelly beans.

Now, to find the average of these guesses, we add them together and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog needs 0.5 hours of care every day. So, to find out how much time he spends on all the dogs in one day, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, to find out how many hours he spends in a week, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

35"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]
\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[
2S = 80
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 40
\]

Now that we know \( S \) (the number of silver coins) is 40, we can find \( G \) (the number of gold coins) using the second equation:
\[
G = S + 30
\]
\[
G = 40 + 30
\]
\[
G = 70
\]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. The problem says that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, the problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. 

23"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's figure out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's add the points from both periods to get the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored is:
9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply 2 by 30:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs for 60 yogurts. The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. So, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

75.00"
"Okay, so John has 13 lego sets and he sells each for $15. That means he makes 13 times 15, which is $195. He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, so that's 8 times 20, which is $160. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. 

To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to think about what happened to the lego sets. Since he sold all 13 of them, he doesn't have any left. So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

0"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which means he runs for 1.5 hours each of those days.

First, let's add up the total time he spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

10"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a problem in high school math class.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. The problem tells us that skipping is half as fast as running. So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice that speed:
- Running speed = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, we're told that running is four times faster than walking. So, if running is 6 miles per hour, walking must be:
- Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours:
- Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours.
- Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
- Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
- Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance:
- Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18 miles."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, that means Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Now, if Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon’s iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

So, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"Okay, so let's think about this problem step by step.

Polly can normally throw the gold javelin 400 feet. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times as far. So, we need to multiply 400 feet by 3:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pieces of pie there were in total. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces left} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still eat today without going over your daily limit. You have a daily target of 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories. So, we subtract:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many grams of chips 200 calories would be. The whole bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories. To find out how many grams are in 200 calories, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{60000}{1250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Okay, let's figure out Charlie's net profit step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Charlie's net profit is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - Each article takes 4 hours to write.
   - Total hours on Monday: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Additional articles on Tuesday: \(5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2\) articles.
   - Total articles on Tuesday: \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
   - Total hours on Tuesday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Total articles on Wednesday: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) articles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, one for each cup of coffee.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

First, we need to find out how many Post-it notes she had in total before using them. We know she had 23 left after using 220, so:
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now, we know the total number of Post-it notes she had is the sum of the 80 she started with and the \( x \) she bought:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he bought 5 blue ties, he bought:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent on all ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"Okay, so Tracy had a piece of wire that was 4 feet long. First, we need to figure out how many inches that is. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches. We do this by dividing 48 inches by 6 inches per piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many units are in the whole building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since they produce 252 eggs each day, we multiply that by 7 days in a week:
252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens because Lloyd sells them by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to travel back. He travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The distance is the same, 30 miles. So:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"Okay, so Uriah's book bag is too heavy, and he needs to take out 15 pounds of stuff. He's got comic books and toys. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and each toy weighs 1/2 pound. If he takes out 30 comic books, we need to figure out how many toys he also needs to take out to reach 15 pounds.

First, let's see how much 30 comic books weigh. Since each comic book is 1/4 pound, 30 comic books would weigh:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, by taking out 30 comic books, Uriah has already taken out 7.5 pounds. He still needs to take out:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to take out to get 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by 1/2:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys.

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The charge for each truck tire is $60, and the charge for each car tire is $40.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the truck tires on Thursday:
- 6 truck tires × $60 per tire = $360

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the car tires on Thursday:
- 4 car tires × $40 per tire = $160

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total revenue for Thursday:
- $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic only fixed 12 car tires. The charge for each car tire is $40.

Let's calculate the revenue from the car tires on Friday:
- 12 car tires × $40 per tire = $480

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. We compare the total revenue from Thursday and Friday:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The difference in revenue is:
- $520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

3. Trixie, the other house cat, had 12 kittens.

Now, we add all the kittens together:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

Total number of kittens: \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Okay, so Jean has 30 lollipops and she eats 2 of them. That means she has 28 lollipops left. If she wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we just need to divide the number of lollipops she has left by 2 to find out how many bags she can fill.

So, 28 divided by 2 is 14.

Jean can fill 14 bags."

So, the remaining weight the truck can carry is:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:
1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 25 oranges in total.

- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find out how many that is, we calculate 20% of 25: 
  \[ 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]
  So, 5 oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

Now, let's add up all the oranges that are not good:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \]

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Marcy gets a full pension of $50,000 per year if she works for 40 years. But if she works for 30 years, she gets a part of that pension. For each year after 20 years, she gets 5% of the full pension.

So, let's figure out how many years after 20 years she worked:
30 years - 20 years = 10 years

For each of those 10 years, she gets 5% of the full pension. So, we need to find out what 5% of $50,000 is and then multiply it by 10.

5% of $50,000 is:
0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Now, for 10 years, she gets:
10 * $2,500 = $25,000

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Aleena pays for the first half of the year. The streaming service charges her $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, we multiply $140 by 6:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

So, Aleena pays $840 for the first half of the year.

Next, for the second half of the year, the streaming service charges her 10% less. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $140:

\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

So, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

There are also 6 months in the second half of the year, so we multiply $126 by 6:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

So, Aleena pays $756 for the second half of the year.

To find the total amount she pays for the entire year, we add the amounts for the first and second halves:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

1596"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Find out how many miles Sophia's car can go per gallon:**
   - Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - To find the miles per gallon (MPG), we divide the miles driven by the gallons used:
     \[
     \text{MPG} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
     \]

2. **Calculate how far Sophia can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - To find the total distance she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the tank capacity:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

300"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much time Jim spends on TV and reading in one session:
- Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
- Then he reads for half as long, which is 1 hour (since half of 2 hours is 1 hour).

So, in one session, Jim spends:
2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much time he spends in one week:
- Jim does this 3 times a week.
- So, in one week, he spends:
3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week.

Finally, we need to find out how much time he spends in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, he spends:
9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

36 hours"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Each school sends:
- A girls' basketball team with 5 players
- A boys' basketball team with 5 players
- A coach for the girls' team
- A coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, that's:
- 5 (girls' players) + 5 (boys' players) + 1 (girls' coach) + 1 (boys' coach) = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people per school by the number of schools:
- 4 schools * 12 people per school = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Diamonds**: The problem says there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: It also says there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. **Emeralds**: The problem states there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.

Now, let's add up all the gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[
595

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of Girls**: We know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are twice as many boys as girls. So, the number of boys is 2 times 60, which is 120 boys.
3. **Total Number of Students**: To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together. That's 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
4. **Students per Teacher**: The problem also tells us there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5. So, 180 students ÷ 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36. 

36"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she gets from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. This $100 includes the money she started with plus the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the $40 from the $100:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays, so that's:
5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, the total number of classes in a week is:
25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes

Next, we need to find out how many students she teaches in a week. Each class has 15 students, so:
33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students

Now, we need to calculate how much money she makes. She charges $15.00 per student, so:
495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00

So, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

7425"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the first recipe has 20 instructions. 

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, we need to multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of instructions for both recipes, we add the instructions from the first recipe and the second recipe together:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Tommy made from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

First, we need to calculate how much he made from the brownies:
- Tommy sold 43 brownies.
- Each brownie costs $3.
- So, the total from brownies is 43 * 3 = $129.

Next, we calculate how much he made from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sold 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice costs $4.
- So, the total from cheesecakes is 23 * 4 = $92.

Now, we add the totals from the brownies and the cheesecakes to find out the total amount of money Tommy raised:
- Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221.

So, Tommy raised $221.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much Shiela paid for the cell phones without any interest. She bought 5 cell phones, and each one costs $150.
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750
   \]
   So, the total cost of the cell phones is $750.

2. Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2%, and it applies to the total cost of the cell phones.
   \[
   750 \times 0.02 = 15
   \]
   So, the total interest is $15.

3. Now, we add the interest to the total cost to find out the total amount Shiela needs to pay.
   \[
   750 + 15 = 765
   \]
   So, the total amount to be paid is $765.

4. Finally, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to find out how much Shiela will pay each month.
   \[
   765 \div 3 = 255
   \]
   So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

\[
\boxed{255}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds cost $2.74, which rounds to $3.
- Petunias cost $1.87, which rounds to $2.
- Begonias cost $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- For marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- For petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- For begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

Now, we add up the total amount:
- Total revenue = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, Artie will make $88.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.

1. **4th Level:** 16 square feet
2. **3rd Level:** Since the 4th level is half the size of the 3rd level, the 3rd level must be \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) square feet.
3. **2nd Level:** The 3rd level is half the size of the 2nd level, so the 2nd level must be \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) square feet.
4. **1st Level:** The 2nd level is half the size of the 1st level, so the 1st level must be \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:
60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. The vet said to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food each day for the first 180 days. So, we multiply 180 days by 1 cup per day:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much dog food the puppy will eat for the remaining days of the first year. There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days are:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food each day. So, we multiply 185 days by 2 cups per day:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. The problem says that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, the problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much laundry Raymond does, we take half of Sarah's laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David. We subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To figure out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in two different ways: in packages of 3 for $2.50 each and in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package has 3 flowers, so for 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package has 2 flowers, so for 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so 9 packages cost \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Buying in packages of 3 costs $15.
- Buying in packages of 2 costs $9.

The savings by buying in packages of 2 is:
- \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Okay, so John takes his new dog to the groomer. The groomer says it costs $100, but because John is a new customer, he gets a 30% discount. 

To find out how much the discount is, you take 30% of $100. That's 0.30 times 100, which equals $30. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

So, the grooming cost for John is $70.

First, we need to figure out how much water the two girls got together. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters of water. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters per girl} \]

Since there are two girls, we multiply this by 2:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, we add the water the girls and the boy got:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left is:

10 liters"

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers from the store. So, 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
3. He gets 23 stickers for his birthday. So, 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
4. He gives 9 stickers to his sister. So, 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left."

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

To find out how much Alex weighs, we need to do a bit of math. The problem says Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, first, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds to get Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, their combined weight is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. 

First, let's set up the equations. Let's say:
- \( W \) is the number of games they won.
- \( L \) is the number of games they lost.

We know two things:
1. The total number of games is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. They won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

1. First, we need to find out how many years Gene has been going on vacations. He started when he was 23 and is now 34.
   - So, 34 - 23 = 11 years.

2. Next, we know that Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. So, we need to find out how many vacations he has been on in total.
   - 11 years * 4 vacations per year = 44 vacations.

3. Each vacation gives him one shirt, and each shirt becomes one quilt block. So, the total number of quilt blocks is the same as the total number of vacations.

Therefore, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

   600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of her initial monthly salary. So, we calculate the increase:
   \[
   600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding this to her initial monthly salary:
   \[
   600 + 60 = 660 \text{ dollars}

4. **New Annual Salary After 5 Years**: Now, we calculate her new annual salary with the increased monthly salary:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Salary After 3 More Years**: Since the salary increase only happens once after 5 years, her salary remains the same for the next 3 years. So, her annual salary after 3 more years is still:
   \[
   7920 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

7920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies of his record. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

Together, they sold a total of 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8,000"

"Okay, let's figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic.

First, we need to know how much each type of dinosaur will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Now, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children:
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

   - So, Gerald's original time is 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - To find 90% of 40 seconds, we calculate \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

3. Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

   - Initial volume = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find out how many cans were used, divide the initial volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of plants she has initially is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, the total number of plants she has now is:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the number of plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, to find out how many plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we need to find 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we add 10 to 60:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:
175"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, I need to add up all the pages Solo has to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract that from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John drinks water 4 times a day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses

On the weekends, he drinks water 3 times a day. There are 2 weekend days, so:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Now, we add the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. The city is 42 miles wide. We need to find out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we know that each segment takes 10 minutes to cover. So, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

So, after Poppy's mom places her pieces, there are:

\[
750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces left}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

- The outer length is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
- The outer width is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
- The outer height is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:

- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:

- Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's add up the time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, but we'll leave out Wednesday for now.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour (for the 1-hour episode) + 0.5 hour (for the 30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour (for the first 1-hour episode) + 1 hour (for the second 1-hour episode) = 2 hours

Now, let's add these times together:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we divide the total time on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, before he dropped them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
2. He baked 15 more cookies than he planned. So, the number of cookies he planned to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
3. He wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, the number of cookies he baked last year is 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. The price is $3.00 per gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

2. Next, we need to calculate the cashback. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00 cashback

3. Finally, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback.
   - $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after the cashback, the gas will cost $28.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Next, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total roll-ups eaten = 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.

Finally, to find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each person, we divide the total by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how much water entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water that entered the boat is:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day} \]

Next, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, the number of flowers that actually grew is:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} \]

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let's call the number of ducks \( d \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 300 = 50d \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{300}{50} \]

\[ d = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6."
"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, we need to find out how much she originally paid for the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell the lumber for now that prices have gone up by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- So, the total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're doing it in high school math class.

1. **Understand the ratio:**
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

2. **Set up the total:**
   - We know the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 units (teaspoons and cups).

3. **Express the total in terms of the ratio:**
   - Let's say the number of parts in the ratio is \( x \).
   - So, the amount of sugar is \( 7x \) teaspoons.
   - The amount of water is \( 13x \) cups.
   - The total is \( 7x + 13x = 20x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know the total is 120, so \( 20x = 120 \).
   - Divide both sides by 20: \( x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

5. **Calculate the amount of sugar:**
   - The amount of sugar is \( 7x \).
   - Substitute \( x = 6 \): \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) teaspoons.

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **First Day**: The customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles.
   - So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. **Total Vehicles After the Second Day**: The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day.
   - Vehicles added on the second day: \(30 - 10 = 20\) vehicles.

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container holds 5 vehicles. To find out how many containers were brought in on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container.
   - Number of containers: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) containers.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it was 30% more than Lylah's salary. To find Lylah's salary, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is four years later. We know it increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find out what Lylah's salary is four years later. Since her salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. We'll assume a month has about 4 weeks. So, in one month, Miguel uses:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Kael also brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits they both brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's totals:
\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday.

   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - So, on these days, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - Total for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   - Add the hours from all the days together.
   - Total: \(8 + 12 + 28 = 48\) hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. So, we calculate the distance she covers in those 3 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Next, after the first 3 hours, she slows down to 5 miles per hour. She runs for the remaining 4 hours at this speed. So, we calculate the distance she covers in those 4 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"Okay, so Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. One-third of 60 is 20, so she stamps 20 letters. After stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. This means that before Jennie started, there must have been 30 - 20 = 10 letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought.

Let's call the number of spoons in Julia's package \( x \).

First, we add the spoons from Julia's package and her husband's package:
\[ x + 5 \]

Then, Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, so we subtract those:
\[ x + 5 - 3 \]

We know that after this, she had 12 spoons:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each item costs:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of item Dillon is buying:
- Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Dillon buys 20 peppers:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Dillon buys 10 oranges:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total number of patients seen per day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.

2. **Time spent per patient:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on all patients per day:**
   - 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

4. **Convert total time to hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

5. **Revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

6. **Cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

7. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

Then, 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves that were left:

40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, 30 elves are left.

"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. In June, he spent $60 less, which means he spent $500 - $60 = $440 in June. To find out how much he spent in total for both months, I add the two amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940.

940"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to count how many times Pam and Fred rode the rides.

Pam:
- Roller coaster: 2 times
- Luge: 2 times
So, Pam rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 times.

Fred:
- Roller coaster: 4 times
- Luge: 2 times
So, Fred rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
- Total rides = 4 (Pam) + 6 (Fred) = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so we need to multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
- Total tickets = 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we add the miles from Monday and Tuesday and subtract that from the total:

- Monday: 4 miles
- Tuesday: 24 miles
- Total from Monday to Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles

So, the miles walked on Wednesday would be:
- Total miles (Monday to Wednesday) - Total miles (Monday to Tuesday) = \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

13"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Tom spends on car washes each month. He gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. So, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

720"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many video games Brian has after he lost 5. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we need to calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has after losing 5:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this result to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

40"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are there:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many of these 9 unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

6"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Subs**: Rory orders 2 subs, and each sub costs $7.50.
   - 2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

2. **Chips**: She also orders 2 bags of chips, and each bag costs $1.50.
   - 2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

3. **Cookies**: She orders 2 cookies, and each cookie costs $1.00.
   - 2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

4. **Subtotal**: Add up the costs of the subs, chips, and cookies.
   - $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

5. **Delivery Fee**: There's a 20% delivery fee on the subtotal.
   - 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

6. **Tip**: Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.

7. **Total Cost**: Add the subtotal, delivery fee, and tip.
   - $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00.

29.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark completed in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark can complete 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- So, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[75 - 40 = 35\] questions.

For the second test:
- Mark can still complete 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- So, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[100 - 30 = 70\] questions.

Now, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[35 + 70 = 105\] questions.

So, Mark left 105 questions incomplete. 

105"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem says that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

First, let's figure out what ""four times the number of blue gumballs"" means:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, we add 22 to this number to find the number of pink gumballs:
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is:
\[ 70 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. To find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we can write these relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (There are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

We also know the total number of bees:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Now, let's substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
400"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so he plays:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. If he worked those 14 hours instead of playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out which items are food and which are not. The food items are:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The nonfood items are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Now, let's add up the cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's add up the cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there's a 10% tax on the nonfood items, we need to calculate the tax:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Kim will make each week from his housekeeping business.

First, we need to find out how many clients Kim will have in total:
- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for these 8 clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 2 bottles cost 2 * $2 = $4.
- Each pack of cloths costs $5.
- So, the total cost per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.
- For 8 clients, the total expenses are 8 * $9 = $72.

Now, we know Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pineapples John has in his field. He has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:

\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide 12 by 3:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples he has by the number of times he can harvest them in a year:

\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first Lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. So, \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set. So, \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks.

2125"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the first group leave.
   - So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left and haven't returned yet come back.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned: \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period: 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 15 + 60 = 75 \) bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

- The child ticket costs $10.

So, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she got back:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can figure out how many friends Dorothy has by dividing Charlie's number of friends by 3:

12 friends / 3 = 4 friends

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

4 friends * 4 = 16 friends

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute.

1 mile = 5280 feet

- Steve lives 3 miles from the school, so:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- Tim lives 2 miles from the school, so:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to see how long the winner will be waiting.

- Difference in time:
  \[
  40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
  \]

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many tires were inflated for each type of vehicle:

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came by with bicycles, the total number of bicycle tires is:
   \[ 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires} \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came by with tricycles, the total number of tricycle tires is:
   \[ 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires} \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, the total number of unicycle tires is:
   \[ 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire} \]

Next, we add up all the tires:
\[ 10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires} \]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost for inflating all the tires is:
\[ 20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack has six cookies, so:
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he gets back is:
$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl receives $4.00 in change."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class!

1. Dave bought a pack of french fries and ate 14 of them. So, if we let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack, after Dave ate, there were \( x - 14 \) fries left.

2. Then, a seagull came and ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries. So, after the seagull, there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.

3. Next, three pigeons each ate 3 fries. So, the pigeons together ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. After the pigeons, there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.

4. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. So, the raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries. This means the number of fries left after the raccoon is:
   \[
   (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. After the raccoon, ants carried off one fry. So, the number of fries left after the ants is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. We know that after all this, 5 fries were left. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

7. Now, let's solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many hours Kimo spends in class each week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we add the hours from all the days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in class over the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

272"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long each type of baked good is in feet, and then we can add them all up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we add up the lengths of all the baked goods:
- Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
- Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas all the apes need in one month. We have:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas.

So, the total number of bananas needed in one month is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double this amount to cover the 2-month period:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

1400"
"Okay, let's figure out who ran the most and by how much.

First, let's calculate how far Blake ran:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
- So, Blake's total distance is \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly ran:
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- This is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
- Then, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each trip to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).
- So, Kelly's total distance for this part is \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Adding the first run, Kelly's total distance is \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

Now, let's find out how much farther Blake ran compared to Kelly:
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards

So, Blake ran 80 yards farther than Kelly.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Raphael spent on his school supplies.

First, we calculate the cost of the pens:
- He bought 4 pens at $1.5 each.
- So, 4 pens * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- He bought 2 notebooks at $4 each.
- So, 2 notebooks * $4 = $8.

Finally, the cost of the rim of bond paper:
- He bought 1 rim of bond paper for $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Pens: $6
- Notebooks: $8
- Bond paper: $20

Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than it did on Monday. So, we add 7 feet to the 17 feet from Monday:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together:
- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish

Finally, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: 15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish

1. **Initial Price**: The bag of marbles costs $20.
2. **Price Increase**: The price goes up by 20% every two months.
3. **Time Period**: We need to find the price after 36 months.

First, let's figure out how many times the price will increase in 36 months:
- 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

Each time the price increases, it goes up by 20%. This means the new price is 120% of the previous price. In decimal form, 120% is 1.20.

To find the final price after 18 increases, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Let's calculate it:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 766.75 \]

So, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $766.75.

766.75"
"Okay, let's figure out the total value of all the toys in the room.

First, we know:
- There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
- There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
- There is 1 doll, and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

Let's calculate the cost of each type of toy:

1. **Red Cars:**
   - Number of red cars: 5
   - Cost per red car: $4
   - Total cost of red cars: 5 * $4 = $20

2. **Action Figures:**
   - Number of action figures: 3
   - Cost per action figure: $5
   - Total cost of action figures: 3 * $5 = $15

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
   - Therefore, the cost of the doll: $15

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
- Total cost of red cars: $20
- Total cost of action figures: $15
- Total cost of the doll: $15

Total value of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, if Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour, the total income she would lose is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, if she hires an accountant, the cost is $90.

Now, we need to find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant. We do this by comparing the income she loses by doing the taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars (income lost)} - 90 \text{ dollars (cost of accountant)} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her 30th birthday gift. She picked out a computer with a screen, keyboard, and mouse for €1090. She also chose a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

First, let's add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD Burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

So, the total cost of all the items is €1423.

Next, we need to find out how much money Elvira will have left after buying these items. We subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

77"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many eggs Sandra needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Each flan needs 3 eggs, so:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to get 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs, so:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 times

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke's age is \( B \), then Seth's age is \( 2B \).

2. In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).

3. The problem states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]

5. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]

6. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]

7. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is:
   \[
   S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. 

16"
"Okay, so if Ethel has $8, then twice that amount would be $16. Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice what Ethel has, we add $2 to $16. That means Jimmy has $18.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, for those 5 days, he walks:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the 2 weekend days, he walks:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total miles he walks in a week, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekend:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of each uniform for the marching band.

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, the jacket costs:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature:

1. **Spiders:**
   - There are 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) legs.

2. **Insects:**
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \) legs.

3. **Mutant invertebrates:**
   - There are 3 mutant invertebrates.
   - Each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:

\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
1210"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = \(8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51\)

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the minimum monthly payments Jessica has to make:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]

Now, we add this 50% to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

This is the amount Jessica will pay each month. To find out how much she will pay in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Billy has 60 potatoes to prep. He needs to peel each potato, which takes about 1.5 minutes, and then cut each potato, which takes about 5 seconds.

First, let's calculate the total time for peeling all the potatoes:
- 1.5 minutes per potato
- 60 potatoes

So, \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \) minutes for peeling.

Next, let's calculate the total time for cutting all the potatoes:
- 5 seconds per potato
- 60 potatoes

So, \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) seconds for cutting.

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- 300 seconds ÷ 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Finally, let's add the peeling time and the cutting time together:
- 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to understand the costs and the revenue from selling lemonade.

1. **Costs:**
   - For each gallon of lemonade, it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar.
   - So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - Each gallon makes 20 glasses.
   - So, the revenue per gallon is 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10.

3. **Profit:**
   - They made a total profit of $25.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost.
   - Let's say they made \( G \) gallons of lemonade.
   - The total revenue is \( 10G \) dollars.
   - The total cost is \( 5G \) dollars.
   - The profit equation is: \( 10G - 5G = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = 5 \).

5. **Cost of Lemons:**
   - They made 5 gallons of lemonade.
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - So, the total cost of lemons is \( 5 \) gallons * $3 per gallon = $15.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there are 240 Asians in the race. Out of these, 80 are Japanese. So, to find out how many are Chinese, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of Asians:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Next, we know that 60 of the Chinese participants are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to figure out how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel, and then see how much he has left after those expenses. After that, we'll see how much he donates to charity, and finally, we'll subtract the amounts he gives to his daughter and wife.

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount After Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total Given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final Amount Left:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs.

Next, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, we subtract 4 from 40:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]
So, Monic has 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. So, we add 10 to 36:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \]
So, Rani has 46 crabs.

Now, to find the total number of crabs they all have together, we add up the crabs each person has:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. So, if we let the number of white carnations be \( C \), we can write:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]
2. To find \( C \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

3. Next, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, if the number of red roses is \( R \), we can write:
   \[
   R = 4C
   \]
4. Substituting the value of \( C \) we found:
   \[
   R = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 160 red roses.

5. Since Fred hasn't delivered any red roses yet, he needs to deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're working through a math problem in high school.

1. **Identify the ages:**

   - Jean is two years older than Mark.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

3. **Use the information from two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was \( M - 2 \) years old.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - So, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for Mark's age:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

5. **Find Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

So, Jean is 23 years old.

First, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team 1:**
- Each of the 4 runners takes 55 seconds to run 400 meters.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they take \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much faster Team 1 is compared to Team 2:
- Difference in time: \( 222 - 220 = 2 \) seconds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Probabilities
We need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find out how much more likely the first event is, we divide the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to understand what we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits, and they get 20 pieces of straw in total.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We need to find out how many rats are in each cage.

Let's start by calculating the total straw used for the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages, so there are 10 hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces.

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw in total.

Now, let's find out how much straw is used for the rats:
- Total straw used = 160 pieces.
- Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
- Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
- Straw used for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

We know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out how many rats there are in total:
- Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are divided equally among 3 cages, we can find the number of rats in each cage:
- Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats.

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. This means that every month, the amount Mandy owes increases by 2%.

First, let's calculate the interest for the first month:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
So, after the first month, Mandy owes:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

Next, let's calculate the interest for the second month:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]
So, after the second month, Mandy owes:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

Finally, let's calculate the interest for the third month:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]
So, after the third month, Mandy owes:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find out how many bags the trader sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Then, they went on two different rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - So, after this, there were \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left.
   - And there were 6 white flamingos.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - So, the total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Between Pink and White Flamingos:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Okay, so Violetta wants to buy 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2. If you multiply the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon, you get the total cost. So, 5 crayons times $2 each equals $10. Violetta has $20 to spend. If you subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has, you get the change. So, $20 minus $10 equals $10. 

Violetta will get $10 in change."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one pen costs. We know that:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means one pen costs $1.50.

Next, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"Okay, so we have 200 pounds of carrots, and we need to give 2 pounds of carrots to each of 40 restaurants. 

First, let's figure out how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together. If each restaurant gets 2 pounds, and there are 40 restaurants, then:

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

So, the restaurants will use 80 pounds of carrots in total. 

Now, we started with 200 pounds of carrots. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount used from the total amount:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

120"
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. The city of Soda has a total of 23,786 people. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. To find out how many kids there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

So, we do:
23,786 (total people) - 8,417 (men) - 9,092 (women) = 6,277

So, there are 6,277 kids in Soda.

6,277"
"Okay, let's figure out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. **Initial Cards**: Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First Month**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Second Month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third Month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now.

320"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find out how much Mark makes in total, we add the earnings from both publishers:
   \[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

7500"
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. That means he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water each day. Each pail holds 5 liters of water. So, to find out how many liters of water he gets in a day, we multiply the number of pails by the liters per pail:

11 pails/day × 5 liters/pail = 55 liters/day

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. 

55"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **One-time monetary reward:**
   - John gets a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Original weekly salary:**
   - John makes $2000 a week.

3. **Original annual salary:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his original annual salary is $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **5% raise in salary:**
   - 5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New annual salary:**
   - With the new weekly salary, his new annual salary is $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money made in the year:**
   - Add the one-time reward to the new annual salary.
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

So, John made $114,200 that year.

$114,200"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. She has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes. So, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine these grapes can make. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

100"
"Okay, let's figure out how many slices of cheese Carl used.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl had a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - So, for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Total cheese used: \( 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \).

So, Carl used 31 slices of cheese in total.

31"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the pens Janet originally had:
- She had 22 green pens.
- She also had 10 yellow pens.

So, the total number of green and yellow pens is:
\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of blue pens she bought:
- She bought 6 bags of blue pens.
- Each bag contains 9 blue pens.

So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Then, we need to calculate the number of red pens she bought:
- She bought 2 bags of red pens.
- Each bag contains 6 red pens.

So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, we add up all the pens she has:
- Green and yellow pens: 32
- Blue pens: 54
- Red pens: 12

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:
\[ 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

Therefore, Janet has 98 pens now."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the lowest score Brinley has so far. Her scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we need to find the sum of the remaining four scores:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Mr. Bert allows Brinley to remove the lowest score, so we only consider the four highest scores plus the score from the sixth test. To get an average of 93 with five tests, the total sum of these five scores should be:
93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to make the total sum 465. Let's call this score \( x \).

So, we set up the equation:
367 + \( x \) = 465

To find \( x \), we subtract 367 from 465:
\( x \) = 465 - 367
\( x \) = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

98"
"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total.

First, for the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Next, for the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, add the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers."
"Okay, let's figure out the total weight of Joe's Halloween candy.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ 25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ grams per chocolate bar} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. The problem states that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \text{ candied apples} \times 20 \text{ grams per candied apple} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday. So, she bought:
3 * 4 = 12 cakes

On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. So, she bought:
5 * 12 = 60 cakes

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days. 

76"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much half a dozen plates cost. Since each plate costs $6000, we can calculate the total cost for half a dozen plates:

\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000 to find the cost of twenty dozen cups:

\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12 cups, twenty dozen is:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the cost of each cup is:

\[ 145 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the amount she still needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she now has:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the amount she still needs is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \) and the number of white chickens is \( W \).

We know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

Now, we can set up an equation for the total number of eggs:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Since \( W = R + 2 \), we can substitute \( R + 2 \) for \( W \) in the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Next, we simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. The park is a rectangle, and we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the edge of it.

First, we need to find the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

The length of the park is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. So, we plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find out how many customers were there on the third day, we add the customers from the first two days and subtract from the total:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers in the first two days.

Now, subtract this from the total:
500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers on the third day.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We have two pools, a big one and a small one. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We need to figure out how much water is in the small pool right now.

First, let's set up what we know:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool right now.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool right now.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (because it also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).

According to the problem:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]

Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
\[
2S + 16 = 32
\]

Subtract 16 from both sides:
\[
2S = 16
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 8
\]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water right now.

"Okay, so Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes and a belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. First, I need to add these two amounts to find out the total cost:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, I divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back an extra 10% on top of that. First, we need to figure out what 10% of $2000 is:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, Janeth is paying $165 each month for 12 months. To find out how much she will pay in total over these 12 months, we multiply:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she still owes after making these payments. We subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 220 \]"
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. We know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem also says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if there are 4 roses, then there must be 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, let's find out how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Naomi's Score**: We know Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than 34 is 44. Therefore, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, 68 + 17 = 85. Therefore, Brianna scored 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time Carmen spent on the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time for crossword puzzles is 10 minutes per puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time she spent on the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time for sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes per puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time = Time for crossword puzzles + Time for sudoku puzzles
- Total time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

First, the tank starts with 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to subtract 90 liters from the 120 liters to find out how much water is left in the tank:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Now, Celine collects rainwater. She collects twice as much as what is left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, she collects:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Finally, we add the 60 liters of rainwater to the 30 liters that were already in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. The problem also says he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, to find out how many petunias he plants, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

90 - 40 = 50 petunias

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 + 50 = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

"Okay, so the company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. For the next year, they spend a third of that amount. To find out how much they spend in the second year, you divide $15,000 by 3, which gives you $5,000. 

To find the total amount spent over the two years, you add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

So, Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 per hour, and Benji uses it for 5 hours. So, we multiply 18 by 5:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
So, Benji pays $90 for the raft.

Now, we add the amounts that Carlos and Benji pay to find the total cost:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:
180"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to travel by car. The problem says it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. So, we divide the bus travel time by 2:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ days}}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to add the travel time for the trip to Rochester by bus and the return trip by car:
\[ 6 \text{ days (by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many Pokemon cards James has in total at the start:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

So, the total number of cards initially is:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, let's find the new total number of cards:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 33\% \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Chad owes after using his gift card.

First, we add up the cost of all the items Chad ordered:
- The base burrito costs $6.50.
- Extra meat costs $2.00.
- Extra cheese costs $1.00.
- Avocado costs $1.00.
- Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.50 in total.
- The meal upgrade (chips and a drink) costs $3.00.

Now, let's add these up:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

So, the total cost of the burrito and the meal upgrade is $14.00.

Next, we subtract the value of the gift card:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Combined rate:**
   - Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

4. **Total pieces to be placed:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.

5. **Time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - To find the total time, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn first visited, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 120:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons left on the farm is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, Ashlyn came back and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate 3/4 of 84:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were ready and Ashlyn harvested them. Now, to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we subtract the 63 harvested watermelons from the 84 that were left:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21. 

21"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Mark spends on the cars themselves. Each car costs $20,000, and he buys 12 cars. So, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%, so we take 10% of the total cost of the cars:
\[ 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \]

Then, we need to add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and he has 12 cars, so the total registration fees are:
\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount Mark pays:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
276,000"
"Okay, so let's break this down. On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more than Robert, so she gets 20 + 5, which is 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times the amount she got on Monday. So, 2 times 25 is 50 shells. 

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday. 

50"
"Okay, so if Dax found half as many bugs as there were ants, and there were 50 ants, then there must be 25 bugs. To find the total number of insects, you just add the number of ants and bugs together. So, 50 ants plus 25 bugs equals 75 insects in total.

75"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.

Next, one-third of these penguins jump in and swim in the ocean. To find out how many that is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Then, another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Again, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, we need to find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing. We subtract the penguins that left from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
12"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes per week.
5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
6. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat by the number of tomatoes each vine produces: \(63 \div 3 = 21\).

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza John and his friends will need in total. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend will have:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Next, we need to know how many slices are in one pizza. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

Now, to find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When these 25 pens run out, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these, he can make 1 more new pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is:

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jessa is 20 years old. 

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]
Joan is 25 years old.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]
Mary is 23 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages:
\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there were 1000 students in the school hall. 

1. **Exit A**: 30% of the students left through this exit. 
   - 30% of 1000 is 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.
   - So, 300 students left through Exit A.

2. **Remaining Students**: After 300 students left through Exit A, we need to find out how many are left.
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. **Exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students left through this exit.
   - 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.
   - So, 420 students left through Exit B.

4. **Exit C**: The rest of the students left through this exit.
   - We need to find out how many students are left after Exit A and Exit B.
   - 700 - 420 = 280 students.

So, the number of students who went out through Exit C is 280. 

280"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that John has 54 candies and that he has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we divide John's candies by 2:
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has to find out how many candies James has:
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in high school math class.

1. **Number of Pen Pals:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, the number of pen pals he still has is:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]

2. **Letters Received:**
   Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters Mike receives each week is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Pages to Write:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds to each letter with the same number of pages. So, the total number of pages Mike needs to write each week is:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]

4. **Time Spent Writing:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
   \[
   30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time in hours is:

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Monthly Allowance:**
   Jason has a phone plan that gives him 1000 minutes per month.

2. **Daily Calls with the Boss:**
   Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes he spends on these calls is:
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Extra Calls:**
   Jason also made 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.

4. **Total Minutes Used:**
   To find out how many minutes Jason has used in total, we add the minutes from the daily calls and the extra calls:
   \[
   450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Minutes Remaining:**
   To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly allowance:
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's work through this step by step like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let's say Ginger gave Griffin \( x \) fries.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. So, the difference is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem states that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium \( f \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, we solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]

Next, let's find out how much Jean pays for one week of makeup:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]

Now, let's find out how much Jean pays for the entire 5 weeks:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. So, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \]

1. **Find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies each person ate:**
   - Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
   - Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

3. **Convert the number of cookies to calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
   - Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students:
\[ 3 \text{ classes} \times 20 \text{ students/class} = 60 \text{ students} \]

Next, we know the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. So, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ students}}{2} = 30 \text{ boys} \]
\[ \frac{60 \text{ students}}{2} = 30 \text{ girls} \]

Now, let's look at the number of girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls:
\[ 30 \text{ girls} - 15 \text{ girls} - 12 \text{ girls} = 3 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is:

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows and gets 2 more cows, so each stall now has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth $0.05, 40 nickels are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the whole tree weighs before the termites got to it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and every 10 feet of the tree weighs 400 pounds. So, we divide the height of the tree by 10 to find out how many 10-foot sections there are:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to get the total weight of the tree:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, the termites ate 30% of the tree. To find out how much weight that is, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood the termites ate from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Nancy owes 50 cents for each of the 8 books that are overdue. So, we need to multiply 50 cents by 8:
50 cents * 8 = 400 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 400 cents is the same as $4.00.

Next, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. We need to add this to the $4.00 we already calculated:
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

6.00"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. The problem says that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if we let the number of apples Jamal has be \( J \), then:

\[ J + 8 = 52 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 8 from 52:

\[ J = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Next, the problem tells us that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. If the number of bananas Jamal has is \( B \), then:

\[ B = J + 4 \]
\[ B = 44 + 4 \]
\[ B = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

The problem also says that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. If the number of bananas Andrea has is \( A_b \), then:

\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} B \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits. We add up all the apples and bananas:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add those together:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies (a dozen). So, we need to find out how many dozens 66 cookies make:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the cups of flour needed per dozen:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

11"
"Okay, so we have 9,300 pennies in a cup. We need to find out how much money that is in dollars if we take two-thirds of those pennies.

First, let's figure out how many pennies are in two-thirds of 9,300:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 6200 \text{ pennies} \]

Next, we need to convert 6200 pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar:
\[ \frac{6200}{100} = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is:
62"
"Okay, so Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box has 50 marbles. That means she has \(5 \times 50 = 250\) marbles from the boxes. Then, she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is \(250 + 20 = 270\).

270"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees in his yard.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. So, Ferdinand has:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, Harry has:
   \[
   2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has compared to Ferdinand:
\[
11 - 3 = 8
\]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so we add $25 to $100. That means Samantha has $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so we add $50 to $125. That means Daisy has $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add up their amounts:
- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

So, $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount that all three girls have combined is $400."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   The house costs $350,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   To find the total cost, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[
9500

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to find out how much Mr. Tan made after selling his house.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   The house was sold for $400,000.

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. So, we calculate:
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   Mr. Tan still owed $250,000 on the house.

5. **Total Expenses:**
   To find the total expenses, we add the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   Finally, to find out how much Mr. Tan made, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price:
   \[
   400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

\[
\boxed{118000}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** It takes 20 minutes.
2. **Heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

First, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time is:
91"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the real estate agent spent on the newspaper ads:
- The cost of one newspaper ad is $5.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is 50 * 5 = $250.

Next, we need to find out how much the agent spent on the television ads:
- The cost of one television ad is $75.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- So, the total cost for the television ads is 15 * 75 = $1125.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

1375"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we need to find out how many golf balls there are:

\[ \text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Next, we're told that half of the golf balls are blue. So, we need to find out how many of these 8 golf balls are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up all the M&Ms:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

So, Mary has a total of 762 M&Ms.

762"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many windows are in the bedrooms of one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
So, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Next, we add the additional windows in one house:
- Each house has 4 more windows that are not in the bedrooms.
So, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house:
- The total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The mom bought some things at the store:

- Cocoa for $4.20
- Laundry for $9.45
- Pasta for $1.35

First, we add up the cost of all these items:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost is $15.00. She paid with a $20 bill. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from $20:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the cashier gives her back $5.00 in change.

5.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. That's a lot!

Next, the collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]
The collar takes 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]
The rosette takes 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project. So, the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

315"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount spent: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

3200"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we know Sean has to memorize the lyrics to a song that has 54 lines. So, he needs to memorize 54 lines from the song.

Next, we look at the first scene. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

But only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
\[ \frac{108}{3} = 36 \text{ lines} \]

Now, let's look at the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Finally, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Carly has 80 cards in total. Out of these, 2/5 of the cards have the letter A on them. So, we need to find out how many cards that is:
\[ 80 \times \frac{2}{5} = 32 \]
So, 32 cards have the letter A.

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after the A cards are taken out:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]
So, there are 48 cards left.

Out of these 48 cards, 1/2 have the letter B on them:
\[ 48 \times \frac{1}{2} = 24 \]
So, 24 cards have the letter B.

Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after the B cards are taken out:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 cards left.

Out of these 24 cards, 5/8 have the letter C on them:
\[ 24 \times \frac{5}{8} = 15 \]
So, 15 cards have the letter C.

Finally, we need to find out how many cards are left after the C cards are taken out:
\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]
So, 9 cards have the letter D.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes:
- It takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- So, the total time for small holes is 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes:
- It takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- So, the total time for large holes is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both types of holes to get the total time:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Okay, so Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

20 (current total age) + 10 (Mico's additional age) + 10 (Marco's additional age) = 40

So, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 40."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we would in a high school math class.

We know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times as old as Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's use \( S \) to represent Sam's current age and \( R \) to represent Ruby's current age.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information, in 9 years:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \). First, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \]
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Peter spent on the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs $0.25. So, we multiply 20 by $0.25:
20 * $0.25 = $5.00

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 4 by $0.50:
4 * $0.50 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter spent:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

7"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots and that this is twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if we divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2, we get the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people are going to the soccer game. There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the number of guests is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, we add the 3 coaches to the total number of people:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many pizzas are needed. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by 3:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Topaz Gemstones:**
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Total Length of the Necklace:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

3. **Length for Sterling Silver Beads:**
   - The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

4. **Sterling Silver Beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25:
     \[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add the total number of stories written by all three:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Okay, so if Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice her age, which means he's 18 years old right now. If we want to know how old he'll be in 3 years, we just add 3 to 18. So, he'll be 21 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has in total. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
  5 * 25 = 125 cents

- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
  2 * 10 = 20 cents

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

90"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many stars are in the rows that are not 5-star rows. There are three rows of 8 stars each and two rows of 6 stars each.

For the 8-star rows:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

For the 6-star rows:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, let's add these together to get the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

Next, we need to see how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the number of trucks needed is:

3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles per hour.

Now, we need to figure out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour. So:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Find out how many medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - So, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
   - So, the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

The total number of medals given out for counting is:
390"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 4 by 6:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
So, the adults get 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide 16 by 8:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]
So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she takes a half-hour break, so she only works for 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to convert 2.5 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2.5 hours is:
\[ 2.5 \times 60 = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:
\[ 150 \div 10 = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

75"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

4. **Sum of All Points:**
   \[
   22 + 18 + 43 = 83
   \]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

83"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Will buys 15 oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half the age of the oldest, which means he is 4 years old, so he washes 4 oranges. Together, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. 

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the activities for both days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we add all these totals together:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is 370."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much rice each person eats in one meal. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.

Next, we need to find out how much rice the whole family eats in one meal. There are 5 people in the family, so:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Since they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much rice they consume in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Sam's goal is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend to sell bread.

Here's what he sold:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Now, let's add up all the crates he sold:
15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) + 20 (Weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. Each time someone bids, the price goes up by $50.
3. Three other people each bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them.

Here’s how the bidding goes:

- The first person bids $250.
- Carmen bids $300.
- The second person bids $350.
- Carmen bids $400.
- The third person bids $450.
- Carmen bids $500 and wins the desk.

So, Carmen ends up paying $500 for the desk.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much John pays for his driving service each year.

1. **Distance to Work:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away.
   - He goes there and back each day, so that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Distance:**
   - John goes to work 5 days a week.
   - So, he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.

3. **Annual Distance:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - So, he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - The driving service charges $2 per mile.
   - So, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - The total cost for the miles driven is $30,000.
   - The total bonus is $1,800.
   - So, the total annual cost is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. To find out how much time he needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the time from Sunday and Monday together and then double it because he wants to do twice that amount on Tuesday.

So, 23 minutes (Sunday) + 16 minutes (Monday) = 39 minutes.

Now, we need to double 39 minutes to find out how long he should exercise on Tuesday:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to think about how the pages are arranged. Each piece of paper, when folded, can hold 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.

So, if we have 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper} \]

So, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"Okay, so Annika had $50 to start with. She spent half of it, which is $25, on food and snacks. Then, she spent another $10 on rides. So, she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she started with: $50 - $35 = $15.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Books and Unsold Books:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - There are 50 unsold books left.
   - So, the number of books sold so far is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

2. **Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year.
   - So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total books sold over the three years is 200.
   - Books sold in the first year = 90 books.
   - Books sold in the current year = 45 books.
   - Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books.

5. **Earnings in the Second Year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - So, the earnings in the second year = 65 books * $20/book = $1300.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
1300"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Watson made in April.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) working days. But since April has 30 days, it's a bit more than 4 weeks. To be precise, it's 4 weeks and 2 extra days. Since he works 5 days a week, he works 21 days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Total hours worked in April: \(21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours}\).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \(210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April: \(4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \(2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Watson made $3300 in April.

"Okay, so John arm wrestles 20 people and he beats 80% of them. First, we need to find out how many people that is. 

80% of 20 is calculated like this:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beats 16 people. Since he arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John loses to 4 people.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, the bakery has:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 4 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

So, Joey loses 2 pounds each week.

Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at the ice cream:
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- The new price of one tub of ice cream is $11.
- So, the discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.
- If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, let's look at the milk:
- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add up the total savings:
- Total savings on ice cream: $4
- Total savings on milk: $2
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many new arms a person will grow in 15 days. The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days. So, we divide 15 by 3:

\[ 15 \div 3 = 5 \]

This means the person will grow 5 new arms in 15 days.

Next, we need to find out how many new legs a person will grow in 15 days. The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days. So, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ 15 \div 5 = 3 \]

This means the person will grow 3 new legs in 15 days.

Now, we add the number of new arms and new legs to get the total number of new limbs:

\[ 5 \text{ (new arms)} + 3 \text{ (new legs)} = 8 \text{ (new limbs)} \]

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Theo spends on the business suits:
- He buys 6 suits at $100 each.
- So, 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100.
- So, 5 * $100 = $500
- Adding $700 to $500 gives us $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up all these expenses:
- Suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200
- Total expenses so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
- Total money: $6000
- Savings: $2000
- Amount to spend: $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
- Amount to spend: $4000
- Total expenses: $1950
- Amount left for gifts: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many eggs the family eats each day. There are 5 people in the family. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

For the three people who eat 3 eggs each:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

For the two people who eat 2 eggs each:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

So, the total number of eggs eaten each day is:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"Okay, let's work through this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Find Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Find Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Find the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Find the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - So, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - To find \(P\), we multiply both sides by 2: \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

So, the current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

We know that the football team has 105 members in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's use \( D \) to represent the number of players on the defense. Then:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class!

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited in total:
- She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the number of sick people had previous commitments. So, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people had previous commitments.

So, the total number of people who couldn't attend is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of people invited:
\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

First, let's figure out how many marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's add up all the marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (initially in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:

2. **People who left:**
   - After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

3. **People remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

4. **Men remaining:**
   - We know that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Women remaining:**

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 divided by 2, which is $2.

Next, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Since the magazine costs $2, the pen costs $2 minus $1, which is $1.

So, the pen costs $1.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and all together, she has 26 pencils. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. We can set up the equation like this:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with the boxes:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find the number of pencils per box:

\[ \text{pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together gives:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, with each box holding 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cooling the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Since she uses 5 ice cubes, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - To find the total weakening, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Okay, so let's think about this step by step. If 5 people come into the store and they leave with 7 new records, and the rule is that you need 2 old records to get 1 new record, we can figure out how many old records they brought in.

First, we know that for each new record, 2 old records are needed. So, if they got 7 new records, we multiply 7 by 2 to find out how many old records were traded.

7 new records * 2 old records per new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Find the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - Junior programmers make up \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Find the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - There are 40 junior programmers.
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:**
   - There are 60 senior programmers.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   - Add the total monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on, so now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Let's simplify that:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[

   \]
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
5. Adding the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops left."
"Okay, so the phone needs to go from 60% to 100%. That means it needs 40 more percentage points to be fully charged. The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, it would take:

40 points * 3 minutes/point = 120 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 120 minutes by 60 to get the time in hours:

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

2 hours"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Erin has 7 lollipops. Then, her mom gives her 10 more. So, we add those together:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So, we subtract those 3 from the 17 lollipops Erin has:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - They earn $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - So, the number of rewards is \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).

2. **Determine the discounts used on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price, so the coupon discount is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

3. **Calculate the total discount:**
   - Total discount = Rewards discount + Coupon discount = $4 + $8 = $12.

4. **Calculate the amount paid on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - After applying the total discount of $12, the amount paid is \( 43 - 12 = 31 \).

"Okay, let's figure out which job will give Nick more money after taxes.

**Job A:**
- Nick earns $15 per hour.
- He works 2000 hours a year.
- So, his total earnings before taxes are \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars.
- The state tax is 20%, so he pays \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars in taxes.
- After taxes, he has \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

**Job B:**
- Nick earns $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- After property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars.
- The state tax is 10%, so he pays \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars in taxes.
- After taxes, he has \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars.

Now, let's see how much more money Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A:
- Net pay at Job A: $24,000
- Net pay at Job B: $32,400
- The difference is \( 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \) dollars.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at Furniture United's offer:
- They want an advance payment of $1,350.
- Then, you have to pay 6 monthly installments of $350 each.

To find the total cost, we add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments:
- Total monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's look at Cozy Homes' offer:
- They want an advance payment of $1,100.
- Then, you have to pay 9 monthly installments of $250 each.

To find the total cost, we add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments:
- Total monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, to find the cost difference between the two offers, we subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes from the total cost of Furniture United:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100."

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Jason (I think you meant RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

So, the total number of guns is:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.

Now, we need to divide these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To do this, we divide 24 by 4:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much sugar Mason needs for the suckers. He needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers. Since he wants to make 8 batches, we multiply 30 ounces by 8:

\[ 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how much sugar he needs for the fudge. He needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge. Since he wants to make 1 batch, we just use 70 ounces:

\[ 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:

\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Maria buys 8 shares of a stock, and each share costs $8. So, the total cost for the shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \text{ per share} \]

Now, the total value of Maria's shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \text{ per share} \]

Finally, the total value of Maria's shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We have a class of 200 students, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups \( x \). The smallest group, then, has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in all three groups is 200, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and these animals are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many of each animal he has:

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of animals:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3C = 60 \]

To find the number of cows, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ C = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
  \[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
  \[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Then, Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, if we add 7 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A, we get:
4 + 7 = 11 dollars for Juice Box C.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag has 36 cookies.

Her son gets 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son gets is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. So, the total number of cookies her husband eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, let's add the cookies eaten by her son and her husband:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos actually paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the factory used to make each day when they were making tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was sold for $100. So, the total daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the factory makes each day now that they are making silos. They sell 5 silos a day, and each silo is sold for $220. So, the total daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money they are making each day with silos compared to tractors. We do this by subtracting the old daily earnings from the new daily earnings:
\[ \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase in earnings by the original earnings and then multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

- Treats cost $20 per month.

- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up all the monthly costs:
\[
100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month}

- On Wednesday, there's a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which is 0.5 hours.
- On Thursday, the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, Peyton spends 2 hours doing errands.

Now, let's add all these up:
1 (yoga) + 3 (cooking) + 0.5 (cheese-tasting) + 1.5 (museum) + 2 (errands) = 8 hours

So, all of Peyton’s after-work activities will take 8 hours."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know John spent 6 hours boating. He also spent half that time swimming, so:
\[ \text{Time spent swimming} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so:
\[ \text{Time spent watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time he spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time on activities} = 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

The problem states that these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's call the total time \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. The problem says he spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So:

Now, I add up all the money she has:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so I need to find out how much more she needs:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save:
45 dollars"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.
3. Now, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the other two trees, so it's 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.

So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Dean's mom gave him $28 to spend at the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars, and each car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
6 cars * $2 per car = $12

Next, he bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add up the total cost of the toys:
$12 (for the cars) + $5 (for the teddy bears) = $17

Dean started with $28, and he spent $17 on toys. So, the amount of money he has left is:
$28 - $17 = $11

Then, Dean's mom feels generous and gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, Dean has $21 left. 

21"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can do a few things:
- Play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5 per person.
- Have $5 in arcade tokens per person.
- Ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 per ride, so $20 for two rides.

First, let's add up the cost for one person:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $20

So, the total cost for one person is:
\[ 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, Morgan has $90 to spend. To find out how many people (including Morgan) can be accommodated, we divide the total budget by the cost per person:
\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]

This means Morgan can have 3 people in total, including herself. So, the number of friends she can invite is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. 

First, we need to figure out how much she spends on lollipops each day:
4 lollipops * 25 cents per lollipop = 100 cents = $1.00

So, she spends $1.00 on lollipops each day.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying the lollipops:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

This means she saves $4.00 each day.

Now, we need to calculate how much she saves over 5 days:
$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

20.00"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys some candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much he spent on the gumballs. Each gumball costs $0.05, and he bought 40 gumballs:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, his total change before buying gumballs must have been:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy had $4 left after buying the candy. This means he spent:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

on the candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Carver just turned 45 years old, and that makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We need to find out how old his son is.

First, let's set up the equation. If Carver's son's age is \( x \), then twice his son's age would be \( 2x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). We start by adding 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
   - Then it goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
   - Finally, it goes 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs to get back to the first city. So, the combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

   Adding these up, the total distance for one complete trip is:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day.
   - So, the total distance traveled in one day is:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

- A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.

To find the average, we add these two amounts and divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing for 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

23"
"Okay, let's figure out how long John's trip took.

First, we need to calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance for this part of the trip is 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance for the return trip is 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour.

For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the times for both parts of the trip to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for John's trip is 6 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boys are in the fourth grade at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to account for the boys who were absent on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys who were present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"Okay, so if there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice that, then there are 12 boys. So, to find the total number of kids, you add the girls and the boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Jane needs to score a total of at least 42 points across 3 tests to move to the next school year. She already scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. 

First, let's add up the points she has so far:
15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach at least 42 points:
42 (total needed) - 33 (points she has) = 9 points

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

9"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks.

Next, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Then, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add up the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out is 50. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the reasons we already know from the total:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 19 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know that Sara has 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 more points, Erin has three times as many points as Sara.
3. So, if Sara has 8 points, three times that is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
4. This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
5. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total of 24 points.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"Okay, let's figure out the total cost for the senior gifts step by step.

1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames: \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - Additional cost per frame: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total additional cost for etching: \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers: \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords: \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up all the costs: \( 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
1198"
"Okay, so if the hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market and making it yourself saves 20%, we need to figure out what 20% of $400 is and then subtract that from $400.

First, calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, you save $80 by making it yourself. Now, subtract the savings from the original price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But, 6 people returned their pairs, so the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 100.

On Tuesdays, Hallie practices for 1 hour.
On Thursdays, she practices for 2 hours.
On Saturdays, she practices for twice as long as she does on Tuesdays, so that's 2 hours (since 1 hour on Tuesday times 2).

Now, let's add it all up:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

So, Hallie practices for a total of 5 hours each week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find out how much the faulty equipment is worth, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment is worth $160,000.

3. To find out how much the functioning equipment is worth, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment.

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

First, let's figure out how much milk she gets from the first 15 sheep:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

Next, let's figure out how much milk she gets from the other 15 sheep:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total milk:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

45 kg"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 kids, so that's 6 rolls gone. Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. She then breaks each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces and feeds them to the chickens. So, the number of pieces the chickens get is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - So, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, let's add up the apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total number of apples picked:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Karan has to pay each month.

First, we need to find out how much interest Karan will pay over the five months. The interest rate is 10%, and the loan is for 5 months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   - Principal (P) = $3,650
   - Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
   - Time (T) = 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year

   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos.

Next, we need to find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has:
- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos:
- Total pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade:**
   - Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - So, the total number of cups is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) cups.

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:**
   - She sells each cup for $1.
   - So, the total revenue is \(36 \times 1 = 36\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - The cost of supplies is $18.
   - So, the total profit is \(36 - 18 = 18\) dollars.

4. **Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade:**
   - She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - So, the total time to sell all 36 cups is \(36 \div 4 = 9\) hours.

5. **Calculate the profit per hour:**
   - The total profit is $18.
   - The total time is 9 hours.
   - So, the profit per hour is \(18 \div 9 = 2\) dollars.

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we learned in high school math.

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the 12.8 hectares represent the \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land that he didn't sell.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 (or the whole) of his land would be. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times \text{Total Land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
\]

To solve for the total land, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
\text{Total Land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[
12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know the choir has 52 members, and half of them are boys and half are girls. So, there are 26 boys and 26 girls.

The performance is only with the girls, so we start with 26 girls.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find out how many girls can actually perform:

26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

Now, the choir's 3 teachers decide to join the performance. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who can make it:

13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for her is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars per ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's look at David. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. So, the total cost for David is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap. She has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Next, Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gift bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

12"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to add the parts of the ratio together:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide 165 by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

So, each part of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cable Package Cost:**
   - Tim's cable package costs $60 a month.

2. **Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix costs $10 a month.
   - Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling them together.

3. **Calculating the Discount:**
   - The total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20.
   - The discount is 20%, so Tim saves 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

4. **Total Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
   - $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

5. **Savings:**
   - The savings by cancelling the cable package and switching to streaming services is:
   - $60 (cable) - $26 (streaming) = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services.

**Final Answer:**
34"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much time Carol spent on each part of her work:
- Writing the song: 4 hours
- Recording the song: half the time of writing, so 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
- Editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. Let's use minutes:
- Writing the song: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Recording the song: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- Editing the song: 90 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time to get the total work time:
- Total work time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

20%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system that has 6 rows and 6 columns.

First, we need to find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

So, the shelving system can hold 36 books.

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. First, we double the number of books:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 more books to this number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself. Her dad also gave her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, and each box had 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards, the total number of cards she had initially is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, the total number of cards she passed out is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \]

Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially, the number of cards she has left is:
\[ 50 - 29 = 21 \]

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from her family and friends. Adding these to the cards she has left, the total number of cards she now has is:
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the pizza has 12 slices. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. So, we need to find out how many slices that is:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Let's find out how many slices that is:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (to Bill) + 3 slices (to Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we add those 2 slices to the 7 slices already given away:
7 slices + 2 slices = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original 12 slices:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

So, there are 3 slices left.

"Okay, so Mark has $50 in his bank and he wants to buy a bike that costs $300. First, we need to figure out how much more money he needs. 

So, $300 - $50 = $250. That's how much more he needs to save.

Now, Mark earns $10 every day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide $250 by $10.

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days.

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days to buy the bike.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: She saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:
168"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

To find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:
42 - 30 = 12

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many days the builder works in a month. The builder works 4 weeks each month, and each week he works 6 days. So, we multiply 4 weeks by 6 days:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ days per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he works in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the number of days he works in a month by 12:
\[ 24 \times 12 = 288 \text{ days per year} \]

Now, we know the builder gets paid $50 for each day he works. To find out how much he earns in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a year by his daily pay:
\[ 288 \times 50 = 14400 \]

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

1. **Flour:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.

2. **Milk:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

3. **Bags of Flour:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
   - Mark needs 12 cups of flour, so he needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

4. **Bottles of Milk:**
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
   - Mark needs 4 cups of milk, so he needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

5. **Difference:**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
   - The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.

Next, we calculate how much energy it uses in a day when it's on for 8 hours:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours} \]

The energy saved each day is the difference between the original usage and the new usage:
\[ 7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours):
\[ \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

Finally, to find out how much energy is saved over 30 days:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

First, we need to find the total number of stripes on all the zebras. We have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. To do this, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. We have 4 zebras in total.

So, the average number of stripes is:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]
So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese he needs. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, he will need:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total cost for the cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese to find the total amount Tyson will spend:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Allan has 40 cannolis. The problem says he has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, we can figure out how many corns he has:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Then, Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already did half of his steps walking to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then, he went for a short walk with his friend and did another 1,000 steps. So far, he has done:

5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he still had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had:

10,000 (total goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

Since he had already done 6,000 steps before the jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

8,000 (steps before jog) - 6,000 (steps already done) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page has about 200 words. So, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ 9000 \text{ words} \div 300 \text{ words/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, he will have:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much the company paid in May. 

- There were 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- They were paid $15 per hour.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 40 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's figure out how much the company paid in June.

- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
- 3/4 of 40 employees is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

The total pay for one employee in June is the same as in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 30 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Sally buys 2 pounds of taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50. 

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, Sally buys a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she buys 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

So, Sally has $3.00 left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400.
2. He also buys another pack that costs twice as much as the first one. So, the second pack costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of both packages before any discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. So, the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. After applying the discount, the cost of the two packages is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
7. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total, the total amount Tim spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, and she says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles might explode. 

To find out how many candles might explode, we calculate 1% of 50,000:

\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \]

So, 500 candles might explode.

Next, we know that 5% of the candles that might explode also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 

To find out how many of these 500 candles might both explode and smell like wet dog, we calculate 5% of 500:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles might both explode and smell like wet dog.

So, each blouse is discounted by $6. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to multiply the discounted price by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half of that amount from the shortest trees, so that's 15 apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \( x \) apples from the average trees.

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, so that's 0 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the numbers we know:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we did in high school math class.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. We know two things:
1. There are 180 heads in total.
2. There are 304 humps in total.

Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We need to find out how many dromedaries there are.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]

Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[
D = 180 - C
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker:
   \[
   5 \text{ cubic inches} \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker:
   \[
   20 \text{ cubic inches} \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Stanley was standing at 10,000 feet on the mountain.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from where Stanley was standing.
   So, the comb landed at: 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is at 3,000 feet on the mountain.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000. Then, he got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 times $4000, which is $8000.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
- Initial capital: $5000
- From the first bank: $4000
- From the second bank: $8000

So, $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000

Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

17000"
"Okay, let's work this out step by step.

First, we start with 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each took 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the 20 cats that were taken by the boats from the original 50 cats:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12. 

12"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill pays for the streaming service over 2 years.

First, for the first 6 months, the service costs $8 a month. So, for 6 months, it's:
6 months * $8/month = $48

Next, for the following 8 months, the price goes up to $12 a month. So, for 8 months, it's:
8 months * $12/month = $96

After that, for the remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the price is $14 a month. So, for 10 months, it's:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Total Savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Savings from Each Pair of Jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Original Prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Difference in Original Prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many employees each type of vehicle can hold:

1. **Buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees. There are 4 buses.
   - So, 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

2. **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees. There are 6 minibusses.
   - So, 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

3. **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees. There are 10 minivans.
   - So, 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the employees that can be transported by the buses, minibusses, and minivans:

- 240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

570"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more. So, she has a total of 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds. Since she has 3 store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts:
\[ 20 \text{ birds} + 10 \text{ birds} = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Since she has 3 homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we add the birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders:
\[ 60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Aleksandra had to pay for her dinner.

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we do:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   So, the soup costs:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is:
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
4 \text{ (bagel)} + 5 \text{ (soup)} + 2 \text{ (cake)} = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and he ends up with $50 extra for spending cash. So, he must have made a total of $150 from selling his Pokemon cards.

Each card sells for $1.5. So, if he made $150, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing $150 by $1.5:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = 100 \]

To solve for the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

150"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step:

1. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of these guests to have two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests.
3. For these 18 guests, he prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.
4. The other 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for them.
5. In total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog:
1. Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs, so they would need 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs in total.
2. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared.
3. The number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem says her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. So, we first find half of 6:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 to this number to get the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

13"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, I'll add up the cost of all the items Charlotte wants to buy:
- The pots and pans set costs $120.00.
- The mixing bowls set costs $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, the store is offering a 20% discount on everything. To find out how much the discount is, I'll calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items Dora wants to buy:
- The skipping rope costs $6.
- The board game costs $11.
- The playground ball costs $2.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to add up the money Dora has:
- She has saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

So, the total amount of money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy all the items. We do this by subtracting the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

30"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to figure out how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

2. Josey needs 1/4 of a container. So, we need to find out how much 1/4 of 3 gallons is:
   \[ 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Money George Had:**
   - George started with $5.

2. **Money Left After Spending:**
   - He had 1% of his money left, which is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - So, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **Money Spent on Candy Bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

5. **Number of Candy Bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Okay, so Ray had 25 lollipops. He decided to keep 5 for himself, which means he shared the rest. So, 25 minus 5 is 20 lollipops that he shared. He has 4 friends, and he shared these 20 lollipops equally among them. So, 20 divided by 4 equals 5. Each of his friends got 5 lollipops.

5"
"Okay, so Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces, which means each piece weighs 2.5 ounces because 20 divided by 8 is 2.5. Rory and her mom each take a piece, so that's 2 pieces or 5 ounces in total. To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we subtract the 5 ounces they ate from the original 20 ounces. So, 20 minus 5 is 15 ounces.

Next, we need to share these oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. That means there are a total of 8 people (2 + 6 = 8).

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, each person will get 7 oranges.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so he uses \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
   - Onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for the onions is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box is on sale for $2.00.
   - So, the cost for the beef stock is \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for all the ingredients is \(8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Cost per Serving:**

1. **Wayne's Drive Time:**
   - Wayne's hotel is close to the theater, and it takes him 4 minutes to get there.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's.
   - So, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - So, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves 4 minutes before \( T \), so he leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes.

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**
   - The difference between Bernadette's and Wayne's departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can use this formula to find the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

First, we need to find out how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Elizabeth's total beads = 1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's find out how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Margareth's total beads = 3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has compared to Elizabeth:
- Difference = Margareth's total beads - Elizabeth's total beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

First, Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer. So, we need to find out how much warmer the house gets from baking:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, after baking, the house is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, we need to find out how much the house cools down in 30 minutes:

30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So, the house cools down by 6 degrees. Now, we subtract this from the temperature after baking:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

3. **Run:**
   - Let's call the time it took James to run \( R \) minutes.
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
   \[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + R = 180 \]
   \[ R = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how long Movie C is in minutes. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes by multiplying:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. 

1. **Convert 30 minutes to hours:**
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, so it's 0.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - Speed = 32 miles per hour
   - Time = 0.5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 32 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for running 16 miles.

3. **Calculate the hay needed:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.
   - For 16 miles, the horse eats 16 × 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Now, we need to find out the cost of 8 bails of hay.

4. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Cost of 8 bails = 8 × $3 = $24

Finally, we need to determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay.

5. **Calculate the total money Michael has:**
   - Michael has 6 five-dollar bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30

6. **Calculate the change:**
   - Change = Total money - Cost of hay = $30 - $24 = $6

So, the change Michael has after buying the hay is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She uses 4 dozen eggs from cases and 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

2. Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 more points. So, we add 225 and 10:
   225 + 10 = 235 points

3. Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:
   240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"Okay, let's figure out the salesman's profit step by step.

1. **Cost of the sneakers:**
   The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. So, the cost is $576.

2. **Revenue from the flash sale:**
   He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
   \[
   17 \times 20 = 340
   \]
   So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

3. **Number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   He had 48 sneakers initially and sold 17 at the flash sale.
   \[
   48 - 17 = 31
   \]
   So, he sold 31 sneakers to the department store.

4. **Revenue from the department store:**
   He sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each.
   \[
   31 \times 25 = 775

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many crayons are in the six packets that each have eight crayons. We do this by multiplying the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many crayons are in the four packets that each have sixteen crayons. We do this by multiplying the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total number of crayons:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons.

112"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra.
   - So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - The movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

   So, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \).

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.

   So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   15 + P = 21 - 2
   \]
   \[
   15 + P = 19
   \]
   \[
   P = 19 - 15
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much it costs to fill one helium balloon before the price increase. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20:

\[
900 \div 20 = 45
\]

So, the original cost to fill one balloon is $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by 170:

\[
65 \times 170 = 11050
\]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

\[
11050
\]"
"Okay, let's figure out the average speed of the car during the trip.

First, we need to find out how far the car traveled in total. 

- For the first part of the trip, the car was going 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance for this part is:
  \[
  60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car was going 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance for this part is:
  \[
  30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we add these distances together to get the total distance:
\[
120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total time the car was driving:
\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph. 

50 mph"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires at the start is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she gets is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:
- 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8)
- 2 rubies

Now, let's calculate the total value of her remaining jewels:
- The value of the 5 sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]
- The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these values together gives the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
6400"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and so does Nancy. That means together, they eat 4 apples + 4 apples = 8 apples a day.

Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. So, we multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much soil is needed for one raised bed. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we need to find the total volume of soil for all the beds:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:
1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Red Cards**: We know there are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: It says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Okay, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying around the forest. Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did, which means her friend saw 25 fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 that were already there, making a total of 75 fairies. But then, 30 fairies flew away. So, if we subtract 30 from 75, we get 45 fairies left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many puppies there are in total. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

First, we calculate the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, we convert this to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
35%"
"Okay, let's figure out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed.

First, let's add up the weight of all the feed:

- **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum these weights:

\[
2 \text{ pounds} + 48 \text{ pounds} + 3150 \text{ pounds} + 1300 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Grayson earns each week from recycling cans and bottles.

1. **Earnings from cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. **Earnings from bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. **Total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. **Total earnings for a four-week month:**
   - Total monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
   - Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 

To find 60% of Frederick's plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. 

So, Shondra has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply 6 by 25:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply 5 by 40:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the total number of cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract 50 from the total number of cards to find out how many cards she gives to her students:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, we divide the number of cards given to students by 10 to find out how many students there are:
\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much Becky paid for her apples:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, the total cost before any discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's figure out how much Kelly paid for her apples:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, the total cost before any discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount.
- The discount amount is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

First, we need to know how many of each item are in one room:
- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the items in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items in one room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 items.

Since there are 80 rooms, we multiply the total items in one room by the number of rooms:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items.

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200.

4. **Shoes received on Friday:** He gets 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up all the shoes he has before he gets rid of any:
\[
200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
\]

5. **Shoes discarded on Saturday:** Frank gets rid of 180 shoes.

So, the number of shoes he has left on Sunday is:

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - 1/5 of 300 pencils is \(300 \div 5 = 60\) pencils.
   - So, 60 pencils were used, and the remaining pencils are \(300 - 60 = 240\) pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Matt's dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Matt wants to eat five cookies in total.

First, let's set up the equation. If \( c \) is the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, then the number of cookies he can have is:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( c \). Start by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, to get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"Okay, so we have a 10-foot shark, and there are two 6-inch fish, called remoras, attached to it. First, we need to figure out how long the remoras are in feet because the shark's length is given in feet. 

1 foot equals 12 inches. So, each 6-inch remora is:
6 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, their total length is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, to find out what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up, we use this formula:
(Length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

So, we have:
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

The remoras make up 10% of the shark's body length.

10%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, then these 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
\]

To solve for the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80

First, we know there are 32 kids in Gina's class. Some of these kids have allergies, and we need to find out how many don't have any allergies at all.

- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

To find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both), we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, but we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both so we don't count them twice.

So, we do:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids with allergies from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (kids with allergies) = 20 kids are not allergic to anything.

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

   - Each ticket costs $5000.
   - Since Tom and his wife are both going, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel:**
   - The normal price per day is $1500.
   - Because it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive.
   - To find the increased price per day:
     \[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Gabriel has 20 songs on his media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, we calculate how many songs Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Next, we need to figure out how many more songs each of them can add to their players. The media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs.

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
So, Luri can add 40 more songs.

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we do:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Stetson gave up. He gives up $10 for each orange he eats. So, for 24 oranges, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
240

"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. Jillian's handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. First, we need to know how much 3 times the cost of her shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we multiply 80 by 3:

\[ 80 \times 3 = 240 \]

Now, the handbag costs $20 less than this amount. So, we subtract 20 from 240:

\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

So, Jillian's handbag costs $220.

220"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles each day for 5 days a week. So, we multiply 12 miles by 5 days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends running each week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by his speed:

60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **How much oats does one horse eat in a day?**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - They are fed twice a day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **How much oats do all four horses eat in a day?**
   - If one horse eats 10 pounds/day, then four horses eat 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **How much oats do all four horses eat in five days?**
   - If the horses eat 40 pounds/day, then in five days they eat 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **How many 50-pound bags of oats are needed for 200 pounds?**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - So, the number of bags needed is 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many of Jana's 27 puppies are Pomeranians. Since two-thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this by:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this by:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of the three places, we need to add up the highest temperatures and then divide by 3, because there are three places.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, let's add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide the total by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these three places is -10°F.

"To figure out how many days it will take the kid to save up for the toy car, we first need to see how much more money he needs. The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, he needs $12 - $4, which is $8 more. If he saves $2 every day, we divide the amount he needs by the amount he saves each day: $8 ÷ $2 = 4 days. So, it will take him 4 days to save enough for the toy car.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many eggs can fit on the trays Jaime has. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and he has 2 trays. So, we multiply the number of eggs each tray can hold by the number of trays:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

This means Jaime can place 48 eggs on the trays.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs are left over after filling the trays. Jaime has 64 eggs in total. We subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to fit on the trays is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Sale Offer:**
   - The razors are on sale for ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means if Heather buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free.

3. **Total Packs and Cost:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs, but because of the sale, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

4. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

5. **Total Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors, and she gets 2 packs.
   - So, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To figure out how tall the human pyramid is, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and going to the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add up all these heights to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert this height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}

1. Charisma works for 8 hours each day.
2. She takes a 5-minute walk every hour.
3. So, in one day, she takes 8 walks (one for each hour she works).
4. Each walk is 5 minutes long, so in one day, she walks for:
   \[ 8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]
5. She works for 5 days, so over 5 days, she walks for:
   \[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes.

1. Brett is 14 years old right now.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
4. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years: 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is 38 years old right now.

   - Total cost for morning rides = $6 * 14 = $84.

2. **Afternoon Rides:**
   - Each afternoon ride costs $2.
   - He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.
   - Total cost for afternoon rides = $2 * 14 = $28.

3. **Total Cost:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley brought:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by both Ashley and Brianne to get the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to know how many oranges are needed for one pie. Each pie needs 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's write down the costs for each venue:

1. **First Venue:**
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Food cost per guest: $5
   - Total cost for the first venue: $200 + $5 * number of guests

2. **Second Venue:**
   - Cost per guest (including food): $25
   - Total cost for the second venue: $25 * number of guests

We need to find the number of guests where the total costs for both venues are the same. Let's call the number of guests \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25x \]

We set these two costs equal to each other to find \( x \):
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're in high school.

We know that:
1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use variables to represent the number of insects each person found:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Now, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used in total. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

So, we convert 1/2 to 2/4:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.
- Her grandma used 2/4 of a skein.

Now, we add these fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together.

Next, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. We know that a full skein has 364 yards. So, we multiply 364 by 3/4:
\[ 364 \times \frac{3}{4} = 364 \times 0.75 = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so:
3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug).

Next, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we need to find twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:
2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) = 16 feet
16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

So, the couch is 18 feet long.

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum
- 1 pack of grape gum for $2
- 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1

The total cost for all the gum was $7.

Let's set up an equation to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs. We'll call the cost of each strawberry pack \( S \).

The total cost can be written as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"To figure out the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost and Sticks per Type of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To get the most sticks, Frederick should buy the cheapest option, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many legs all the dogs have together. Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. So, we multiply:

6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Since each pair covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Janet spends on bus trips each week without a pass. She takes 2 bus trips every day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times $2.20 \text{ per trip} = $22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's look at the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
\[ $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:

- On the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- In the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo combined is:

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. The problem says that Rose bought 4 times as many onions and potatoes as Sophia did. So, we need to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of onions Sophia bought)} = 12 \]

To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 4 potatoes and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of potatoes Sophia bought)} = 4 \]

To find the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to get the total:
\[ 3 \text{ onions} + 1 \text{ potato} = 4 \text{ items} \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days (up to the 19th)

Now, let's add these up:
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Next, we need to figure out how many calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. We know that 1 pound is equal to 3500 calories. So, for 30 pounds:

30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal in 200 days:

105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

So, Gerald made $210 in a week. But he also spent $100 during that time. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from what he earned:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate 20% of $500:

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract that from her initial amount to find out how much she has left:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400:

\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on CDs. We subtract that from the remaining $400 to find out how much she has left:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot \( L \) and the cost of the house \( H \).

So, we have:
\[ H = 3L \]

And the total cost is:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) with \( 3L \) in the total cost equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs:
\[ 90,000 \]"

First, we need to know how many minutes Joe is throwing punches in total. A fight has 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the number of minutes per round:

5 rounds * 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes

Next, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find out how many punches he throws in the entire fight, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total number of minutes:

25 punches per minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

So, Joe throws 375 punches in the fight.

375"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies Josh made} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies Kelsie made} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Half of 160 dollars is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after giving his sister $80, Ali has:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find out how much he spends on dinner, I calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert Rob's time to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, the problem says that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double Rob's time:
\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra 40 minutes to this doubled time:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

280"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Martha is making winter clothes for her 3 grandchildren, and each grandchild needs a hat, a scarf, a sweater, mittens, and socks.

- A hat takes 2 skeins of wool.
- A scarf takes 4 skeins of wool.
- A sweater takes 12 skeins of wool.
- A pair of mittens takes 1 skein of wool.
- A pair of socks takes 2 skeins of wool.

First, let's add up how many skeins are needed for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since she has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
21 skeins/child × 3 children = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

63"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
   - So, he has \(100 - 12 = 88\) problems left.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - He did 12 problems on Monday, so on Tuesday he does \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
   - Now, he has \(88 - 36 = 52\) problems left.
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - One-quarter of 52 is \(\frac{52}{4} = 13\) problems.
   - So, he has \(52 - 13 = 39\) problems left.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - So, Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - So, Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - So, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - To find the total, we add up the quarts picked by each person:
   - Tony: 6 quarts/hour
   - Bobby: 5 quarts/hour
   - Kathy: 10 quarts/hour
   - Ricky: 8 quarts/hour
   - Total: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

29"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, we need to find out how many loaves were sold in total:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves left.

Finally, we add the 6 loaves that were returned:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

74"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips, and each row can hold 6 red tulips. So, we divide 36 by 6:

\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]

So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant. He has 24 blue tulips, and each row can hold 8 blue tulips. So, we divide 24 by 8:

\[ 24 \div 8 = 3 \]

So, Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to get the total number of rows:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers.

9"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins.
2. She wants to divide the raisins equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, each activity gets:
   \[
   \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup per batch:
   \[
   \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to figure out how much Ada spends on electricity each day right now. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50.

So, her daily cost is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 18 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the new device will add to her daily cost. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour still costs $1.50.

So, the additional daily cost for the new device is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we add the additional cost to her current daily cost to get the total daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 18 \, \text{\$} + 3 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

To find out how much she spends in a week, we multiply the daily costs by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Her current weekly cost is:
\[ 18 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 126 \, \text{\$} \]

Her new weekly cost after adding the device is:
\[ 21 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 147 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, to find the difference between her weekly costs before and after adding the new device, we subtract the current weekly cost from the new weekly cost:
\[ 147 \, \text{\$} - 126 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
21"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. That's because 5 days is for half, so double that for the whole house.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, and there are 24 hours in a day, then one person would take:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours} \]

If 5 people are working together, they can paint the house 5 times faster. So, we divide the total hours by 5:
\[ 240 \text{ hours} \div 5 = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, she must have 22 chairs because 20 + 2 = 22.

Next, the problem tells us that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. The problem says Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together, we add up all the sofas and all the chairs:

- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

Total sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

So, the total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172.

The final answer is:
172"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. The total amount he spent was $48.

To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44.

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 left. We need to find out how many more CDs he could have bought with that $44. Each CD costs $4, so we divide $44 by $4:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

11"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Josh tracked his workouts for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he worked out for 4 hours each week. But there were a couple of times when he worked out more:

1. For two weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
2. For one week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's figure out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, that's a total of 3 weeks. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:

1. For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're working through a math problem in high school.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:** 48

2. **First stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 8
   - **Passengers remaining:** \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - **Passengers getting on:** 5 times the number who got off, so \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - **New total:** \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 21
   - **Passengers remaining:** \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - **Passengers getting on:** 3 times fewer than the number who got off, so \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - **New total:** \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

So, after the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 66.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, right now, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, the cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

4. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then right now the cousin is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

5. **Age Difference:**
   - The difference in their ages right now is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The computer costs $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. 

Now, the problem says that each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, if each boy brought 60 shells, then four times that amount is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

Adding the 60 shells that the boys brought to the 240 shells:
\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm

First, add 31 and 50:
31 + 50 = 81 mm

Next, add 45:
81 + 45 = 126 mm

Finally, add 62:
126 + 62 = 188 mm

"Okay, so Emma wants to make 72 vlogs in a month. She's already made some vlogs in the first three weeks. Let's add those up:

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

So, 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach 72, we subtract the vlogs she's already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. My wife and I had a dinner that cost $50. She wants to split the bill evenly, but I have to pay an extra 20% tip.

First, let's figure out what 20% of $50 is:
20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the tip is $10.

Now, let's add the tip to the original bill:
$50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60 (total amount)

Since my wife and I are splitting the bill evenly, each of us would pay half of the original $50:
$50 / 2 = $25

But I have to pay the entire tip of $10. So, I need to add the tip to my half of the bill:
$25 (my half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

So, I end up paying $35.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so we can split the month into two halves: the first 15 days and the second 15 days.

1. **First Half of April:**
   - Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
   - So, in the first 15 days, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of April:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half.
   - So, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day in the second half.
   - In the second 15 days, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

3. **Total Savings:**
   - The total amount saved in April is the sum of the savings from both halves.
   - So, \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know the total savings should be $1125.
   - Therefore, \( 45x = 1125 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 45: \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

6. **Amount Saved Each Day in the Second Half:**
   - Since \( x = 25 \), the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"Okay, let's figure out how much change Verna got back.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on each type of fruit:
- For the apples: 3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50
- For the oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00
- For the peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20.00, so to find out how much change she got back, we subtract the total cost from $20.00:
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Next, we calculate how much Jenny earns. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, we multiply 0.5 by 20:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns compared to Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jeff and Brad are splitting 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's call the amount Brad gets \( B \).

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

80"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jeff's work is 3 miles away. This means that when he goes to work, he walks 3 miles, and when he comes back home, he walks another 3 miles. So, in one day, he walks a total of:

\[ 3 \text{ miles (to work)} + 3 \text{ miles (back home)} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Jeff works 5 days a week. So, to find out how many miles he walks in a week, we multiply the miles he walks in one day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week} \]

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Elise writes the full alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   \(13\) letters.

3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. So far, she has written:
   \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

4. Rewriting all 65 letters again means:
   \(65\) letters.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
   \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 130."

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

So, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"Okay, so Mark was sick for 3 months and he lost 10 pounds each month. That means he lost a total of 30 pounds because 10 pounds times 3 months equals 30 pounds. If his weight at the end was 70 pounds, we need to add back the 30 pounds he lost to find out how much he weighed at the start. So, 70 pounds plus 30 pounds equals 100 pounds. 

Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys. So, if we subtract 2 from 400, we can find out how many toys Jonathan currently has:

\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend on his school supplies.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each item he wants to buy:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 * 1.50 = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 * 0.25 = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12.00 each = 1 * 12.00 = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each = 1 * 10.00 = $10.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

27.00"
"Okay, let's figure out how much change Carly gets back.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

- For the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
- For the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each = $3
- For the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly gave a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change:
- Change = $50 - $33 = $17

So, Carly gets back $17 in change."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Antonella made from her sales.

First, we need to know how much she earns from the first $1000 in sales. The commission for the first $1000 is 30%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she earns from the sales over $1000. She sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]

The commission for the sales over $1000 is 10%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to get her total earnings:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450.

450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, I need to know how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases, and each case has 24 bottles. So, I'll multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:
\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, I need to figure out how many bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests. Each guest will need 2 bottles, so I'll multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:
\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, I need to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy. I'll subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

92"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem says that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice that time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much John makes in a week. He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, the total hours he works in a week is:
5 hours/day * 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $2 per hour, so:
20 hours/week * $2/hour = $40/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80. We divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The foot-long fish sub costs $40.
2. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, we multiply $40 by 3:
   \[
   40 \times 3 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes each.

1. Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes:
   \[
   21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes:
   \[
   7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 4 holes:
   \[
   14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. Add the two totals together to get the total number of holes:
   \[
   14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes}
   \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[
70

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, we need to find half of 24 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, we need to find 1/4 of 12 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

3"
"Okay, so Octavia drinks half of the 4 cups of coffee that are recommended each day. That means she drinks 2 cups. Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks 20 cups of coffee each day. If Juan needs to cut down to the recommended 4 cups, he has to reduce his coffee intake by 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

16"
"Okay, so the pet shop has 6 cages of rodents. Out of these, 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, and the other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we need to add up all the hamsters and guinea pigs.

First, let's calculate the total number of hamsters:
3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, let's calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has 45 rodents in total.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we subtract 20 from 150:

\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]

So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

\[ 130 \times 2 = 260 \]

So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. We add their weights together:

\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

180"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Starting Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees above the ground when you're standing at Sahir's house.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves up at a rate of 5 degrees every hour.

3. **Time Passed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement**: To find out how much the sun moves in 10 hours, we multiply the rate of movement by the time:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle**: To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the total movement to the starting angle:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the ages of James's two sons:
- The older son is 12 years old.
- The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total:
- The older son needs 12 candles.
- The younger son needs 8 candles.
- So, the total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy:
- Each pack contains 5 candles.
- To get 20 candles, James needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost:
- Each pack costs $3.
- So, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 * 3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time into pages. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads per minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week to the pages from the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
240"
"Okay, so Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of them, which means he ate 4 sandwiches because \(12 \div 3 = 4\). Trevor ate a quarter of them, so he ate 3 sandwiches because \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Together, they ate 7 sandwiches in total. If they started with 12 sandwiches and ate 7, then there are 5 sandwiches left.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let \( N \) be the nephew's current age, in 7 years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she got for each of the previous three teeth. Since she got $1.00 for each of those, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals. He scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark must have scored 80 - 20, which is 60 goals. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna must have scored 80 - 45, which is 35 goals.

Now, to find out how many goals all three of them scored together, we add up their goals:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

175"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades, and each lemonade was sold for $4. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

21"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Peter has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. That means he will spend $70 / 7 days = $10 each day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5. So, each day he buys $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures. Over 4 days, he buys 2 figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, from Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2. So, each day he buys $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures. Over 3 days, he buys 5 figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add up all the action figures:
- Wooden action figures: 8
- Plastic action figures: 15

Total action figures = 8 + 15 = 23

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 23 action figures. 

23"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost to spay the kitten is $200.
2. Each vaccine costs $20, and there are 3 vaccines, so that's 3 * $20 = $60.
3. Each broken vase costs $12, and there are 4 vases, so that's 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many roses all the flower shops need in a week:
- The first shop needs 20 roses.
- The second shop needs 15 roses.
- The third shop needs 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses needed per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Next, we need to find out how many roses are needed in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's see how many roses Ford can grow in a month:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- So, in a month, he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Finally, to find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he can grow from the number of roses needed:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 by 12:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Katina takes out in total over these 24 months. She takes out $100 each month, so we multiply 24 by 100:
   \[
   24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Finally, we subtract the total amount she took out from her initial savings of $3000:
   \[
   3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - The food truck buys bread for $3.00 per loaf.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - The food truck spends $30.00 on cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

3. **Total Cost for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Cost of bread: $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00
   - Total cost: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

4. **Revenue from Selling 10 Sandwiches:**
   - The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.
   - For 10 sandwiches, the revenue is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

5. **Net Profit:**
   - Total revenue: $70.00
   - Total cost: $33.00
   - Net profit: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the net profit is $37.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. So, the total number of crayons she has is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]

Next, Kate makes crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together. To find out how many crayon muffins she can make, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:
\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \]

Now, if she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:
\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, Kate can make $36.

36"
"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom. The room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet. The carpet costs $12 per square foot:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 2,592 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to remove the old carpet. The removal costs $4 per square foot:
\[ \text{Cost to remove old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to install the new carpet. The installation costs $34 per square foot:
\[ \text{Cost to install new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 7,344 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost, we add up all these amounts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2,592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7,344 \text{ dollars} = 11,232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the birds Mack saw over the week:
- On days one and two, he saw 50 birds.
- On day three, he saw 0 birds.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds is:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Next, we need to find the average number of birds he saw each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of birds by 7:
280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Starting Value**: The problem says the starting value is 20.
2. **Half the Number**: Half of 20 is 10.
3. **Add the Starting Value and Half the Number**: So, 20 + 10 = 30.
4. **Divide by 5**: Now, we divide 30 by 5, which gives us 6.
5. **Starting Value Minus 12**: Next, we subtract 12 from the starting value, so 20 - 12 = 8.
6. **Multiply the Results**: Finally, we multiply the result from step 4 (which is 6) by the result from step 5 (which is 8). So, 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"Okay, so the boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, which means his brother has 2 cards. If we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has, we get:

5 + 2 = 7

So, together they have 7 cards."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out by what percentage the oven is off when it's set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so it's 18 degrees too high.

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage off is:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to if she wants it to reach 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to set it to a temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

Let's call the temperature she should set the oven to \( x \). The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

500"
"Okay, so Max is planning to watch two movies this weekend. The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. To figure out the total time, I need to add these times together.

First, let's convert everything to minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, let's add the two times together:
- 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. To find out how much less, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Now, subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12, so she bought 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, she bought:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's add up all the utensils brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy's total:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils} \]

Her friend's total:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is:

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. So, the discount on one box is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets. Each box has 90 contacts, and since he's buying 2 boxes, he gets:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

2.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate how many hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate their earnings:
- Jill earns $10 per hour, so she earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John earns $10 per hour, so he earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more John earned compared to Jill:
- John earned $70, and Jill earned $30.
- The difference is $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour she burns 500 calories. So for aerobics, she burns:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Next, she runs for 1 hour, and during that time, she burns 600 calories. So for running, she burns:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories. We can set up the calculation like this:
1600 calories * (100 ml / 200 calories) = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

800 ml"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we would in high school math class.

We know that the jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar tells us:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's use \( B \) to represent the number of blue jelly beans. Then:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now that we know \( B = 1500 \), we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM).
2. After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM.
3. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:
   \[
   52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM}
   \]

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds. To do that, we add up all the speeds and then divide by the number of measurements.

The total of the three speeds is:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

To find the average, we divide the total by 3:
\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, he would lose:
\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, he would gain:
\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we add the weight loss and the weight gain:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many seats Alex needs for her event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - So, the number of friends coming is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
   - Total from email invitations: \(100 + 200 = 300\).

2. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of spouses coming is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).
   - Total from phone calls: \(10 + 8 = 18\).

3. **Total Number of Seats:**
   - Adding the totals from the email invitations and the phone calls: \(300 + 18 = 318\).

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

- The shipping cost is $4.
- So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's find out how much the boots cost on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
- So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet.

Let's break it down:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles, so it's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles again, so it's \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles once more, so it's \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms, we need to find out how much protein that is.

Since 200 grams is double 100 grams, the protein content will also be double. So, 200 grams of mushrooms will have:
\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein each day.

Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up an equation to figure out his current age.

Let's say Jerry's current age is \( J \).

Five years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old.

According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice what he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

To isolate \( J \), we subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Then, we add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the total cost of the dental work George needs. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

One of the implants also needs a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, we add that to the total cost:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the amount he still needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George earns $15 per hour at his job. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. We also know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). Then the other two angles would be \( 2x \) and \( 3x \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, the largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
90"
"Okay, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. First, we need to know how much money he has in total.

- He has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- He has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- He has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- He has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add all the money together:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ 345 \div 5 = 69 \]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. 

First, we need to know how many legs each type of animal has:
- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:
- For the dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- For the cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- For the birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Next, we add up all the legs:
20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs

So, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48.

"Okay, so Jamaal starts off lifting an 8-pound weight. He decides to bump it up by 50%. To find 50% of 8 pounds, you just take half of 8, which is 4 pounds. So, he adds 4 pounds to his original 8 pounds, making it 12 pounds. But then, he finds out 12 pounds is too heavy, so he goes down by 2 pounds. That means he's now lifting 12 pounds minus 2 pounds, which is 10 pounds. 

So, the weight Jamaal is now using is 10 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure out how many video games Steve has after 3 years.

1. **Birthday Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.

2. **Games He Buys:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game each month. So, \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games each month. So, \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games each month. So, \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

3. **Christmas Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for Christmas each year. So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games over 3 years.

Now, let's add all these up:
- Birthday games: 5
- First year games: 12
- Second year games: 24
- Third year games: 48
- Christmas games: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, Steve has 104 games after 3 years."
"Okay, so let's think about this step by step. If a plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can figure out how fast the plane is going by dividing the distance by the time. So, 1200 miles divided by 3 hours equals 400 miles per hour. That's the speed of the plane.

Now, if we want to know how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed, we can use the same idea. We divide the distance by the speed. So, 2000 miles divided by 400 miles per hour equals 5 hours.

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, so we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Howard spends $8 on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so that's \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
- Monday: $8
- Tuesday: $16
- Wednesday: $64

Total spent: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

Howard originally had $100. So, the amount of money he has left is:
- $100 - $88 = $12

So, Howard has $12 left."
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade over 6 hours.

First, for the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he made 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he made 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.

Next, for the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he made 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.
- Over two hours, he made 2 hours * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add the money he made in both periods:
- Total money made = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate in one month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we can calculate the number of rotations like this:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left( \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} \]

\[ \text{Years} = 6 \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo for one wash, and this gives you 120 washes.

First, we need to find out how many total pumps of shampoo are in the bottle. If 2 pumps give you 120 washes, then:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

So, the bottle has 240 pumps of shampoo.

Next, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The bottle costs $24.00, and it has 240 pumps. So, the cost per pump is:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the shirt and the shorts before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, we add these together:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, there's a 30% off sale, which means Joe only pays 70% of the total cost. To find 70% of $60, we multiply:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit for $42, we subtract to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants. Since 1 dozen croissants need 1/4 pound of butter, 4 dozen would need:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound of butter} \]

Next, we need to find out how much butter is needed for a whole week. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave. So, we multiply 150 meters by $194:

\[ 150 \times 194 = 29100 \]

So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter to repave. So, we multiply 490 meters by $194:

\[ 490 \times 194 = 95060 \]

So, it costs $95,060 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - So, the cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

2. **Total Research Time:**
   - The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
   - Total research time = 5 months * 10 = 50 months.

3. **Additional Months:**
   - The additional months are 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - For these additional months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - Initial funding per month = $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.
   - Additional funding per month = $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months = $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each beef tip is 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the meat:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total meat consumed: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

So, the team consumed 30 ounces of meat in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know there are 1000 members in the Reddit group. Each member posts 3 posts every day. So, to find out how many posts are made in one day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts each member makes:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many posts are made in the entire month of March. March has 31 days, so we multiply the number of posts made in one day by the number of days in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93000."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many times Gary does laundry in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we can calculate the total number of times he does laundry in a year by multiplying the number of times he does laundry each week by the number of weeks in a year:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water he uses in a year. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so we multiply the number of loads by the gallons per load:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the water. Water costs $0.15 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons of water by the cost per gallon:

First, the aquarium cost her $10.00.

Next, she bought 2 bags of rocks. Each bag costs $2.50, so 2 bags would be:
2 * $2.50 = $5.00

Then, she got 3 pieces of coral. Each piece costs $2.00, so 3 pieces would be:
3 * $2.00 = $6.00

She also bought 20 fish. Each fish costs $0.50, so 20 fish would be:
20 * $0.50 = $10.00

Lastly, she needed fish food, which cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much meat Prince sells in one day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day. So, we multiply 15 kg by 10 hours:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all 750 kg of meat from the bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. The auditorium has 4 rows, and each row has 18 seats. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were taken by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by them:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we need to find out how many of these remaining seats were taken by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were taken by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of street lights per pole:** Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. **Number of poles per intersection:** Each intersection has 6 poles.
3. **Number of intersections:** There are 4 intersections.

First, let's find out how many street lights are at one intersection:
- Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights.
- So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

Next, let's find out how many street lights are on the entire road:
- There are 4 intersections, and each intersection has 24 street lights.
- So, the total number of street lights on the entire road is \( 4 \times 24 = 96 \).

Now, we know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones from the total:
- Total number of street lights: 96
- Non-functioning street lights: 20
- Functioning street lights: \( 96 - 20 = 76 \)

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 356 times. So, the number of times it can still be played is:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644
   \]

2. The second DVD can also be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 135 times. So, the number of times it can still be played is:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865
   \]

3. To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

"Okay, let's figure out how much John's physical therapy cost.

1. First, we need to find out how many sessions John had. He went for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice. So, the total number of sessions is:
   - 6 weeks * 2 sessions per week = 12 sessions.

2. Each session lasted 2 hours. So, the total number of hours he spent in therapy is:
   - 12 sessions * 2 hours per session = 24 hours.

3. The cost per hour of therapy is $125. So, the total cost is:
   - 24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. During the school day, he chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours. Since the school day is 8 hours long, he chews:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

So, he chews 4 pieces during school.

After school, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. That's 2 more pieces.

So, the total number of pieces he chews in a day is:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces (during school)} + 1 \text{ piece (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ piece (after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Starting with 20 pieces, after chewing 6 pieces, he has:

\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:

\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. If Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, that means right now she is 16 minus 12, which is 4 years old. Now, if we want to know how old she will be 4 years from now, we just add 4 to her current age. So, 4 plus 4 equals 8. 

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now. 

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs, and each one costs $3. So, we multiply 9 by 3:
9 * 3 = 27
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, we need to find out how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs, and each one costs $14. So, we multiply 8 by 14:
8 * 14 = 112
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:
112 - 27 = 85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

85"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna planted in total. She has 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. So, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour} \]

Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. To find out how many kb she can download in an hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 72000 \text{ kb} \]

Now, we need to convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000:
\[ 72000 \text{ kb} \div 1000 = 72 \text{ Mb} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

72"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many cars the tow truck pulled in the first three days. The problem says the truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, we do:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cars the truck pulled in the remaining four days. The problem states that the truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day on these days. So, each day the truck pulled:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars pulled over the remaining four days:

\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars pulled in the first three days to the number of cars pulled in the remaining four days to get the total for the week:

\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how tall Adam needs to be to ride the roller coaster. The requirement is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 4 feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many more inches he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his annual growth rate:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Okay, let's figure out how much James made from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find out how much money he made from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, the total amount from selling the cars is:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire these cars. The company paid 30% of the car's price to get each car. So, the cost to acquire one car is:
\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
For 10 cars, the total acquisition cost is:
\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total acquisition cost from the total sales amount:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]

$17,500"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of riders**: There are 100 riders.
2. **Percentage of riders who can stay upright**: 25% of the riders can stay upright.
   - To find 25% of 100, we calculate:
     \[
     100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders}
     \]
3. **Percentage of these riders who are women**: 60% of the 25 riders who can stay upright are women.
   - To find 60% of 25, we calculate:
     \[
     25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women}
     \]
4. **Number of men who can stay upright**: To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.
   - So, we calculate:
     \[
     25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men}
     \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold jewell is 4/5 of the price of a diamond jewell. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold jewell. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is \(4800\)."

   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, let's add up all the stamps:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45

So, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much faster Tom is driving compared to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. So, the difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 75 miles, and the speed is the rate at which Tom is catching up, which is 15 mph. So:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so:
\[ \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Manny signed up for Karate classes, and the total cost is $60. There are 10 classes in total. His parents said they won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10.

First, let's find out the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x \) is positive):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

4"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how many customers Jewel processes in a week:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. So, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Now, we calculate how many customers Julie processes in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add their weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let's say Lynn ran \( L \) miles.
   - According to the problem, Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's distance, so:
     \[
     20 = L + 3
     \]
   - To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     L = 20 - 3 = 17

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges will cost.

For 5 apples:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

For 5 oranges:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

12.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much dirt Bob needs to move. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the volume of the hole, we multiply these three dimensions together:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of Bill's new truck step by step.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: The cost of the leather seats is one-third of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

First, add the base price and the king cab upgrade:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]

Next, add the cost of the leather seats:
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]

Then, add the cost of the running boards:
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000

Finally, add the cost of the upgraded exterior light package:
\[
42000 + 1500 = 43500

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the 5% raise:**
   Tim's current salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an extra 5% of $20,000.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 20000 = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
   \]

2. **Find the new monthly salary:**
   Add the raise to his current salary.
   \[
   20000 + 1000 = 21000

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to find out how much everything cost.

First, we need to figure out the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
- Each pair of dress pants costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- The cost of one pair of dress pants is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's figure out the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit.
- He buys 10 suits, so he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- So, the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the costs to get the total:
- Total cost of suits: $7500
- Total cost of dress pants: $1500
- Total cost of dress shirts: $1800

So, the total cost of everything is \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

So, the news website publishes 560 articles in February.

Next, we need to find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we multiply 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \]
So, the sister company publishes 280 articles in February.

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites together, we add the two totals:

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. She biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Stanley biked. He biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley:
\[ 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

79"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet per hour, and he needs to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, we divide the total feet of soil by the rate at which he digs:

24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. He digs half as fast through clay, so his rate is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay. So, we divide the total feet of clay by his rate:

8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time:

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to count how many people will be getting cupcakes. We have:
- Howie
- His teacher
- 25 classmates

So, the total number of people is:
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Next, each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). So, we need to multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets:
27 people × 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

54"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we multiply 2000 by 70:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we add these to the 140000 likes:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 160000."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates. Each pomegranate cost $20, so the total cost before any discounts or vouchers is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at this new price, so the total cost before any discounts is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

After applying the discount, the final amount Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
142"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Find out how much Ariadne made from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, if $400 is half, then the full amount from green hats is $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - So, sales for the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900

4. **Calculate the total sales for both months:**
   - Total sales for both months = Sales for the first month + Sales for the second month
   - Total sales for both months = $1200 + $900 = $2100

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100."
"Okay, let's figure out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage.

1. **Total Time:**
   - James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours.

2. **Free Hour:**
   - He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs twice the first hour, so it's \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour costs twice the second hour, so it's \(30 \times 2 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up the costs for the 3 paid hours: \(15 + 30 + 60 = 105\) dollars.

So, James paid:

"Okay, so Sally had $200 in her bank at the start of the week. By the end of the week, she has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 added to her bank. Since her weekly wage is supposed to be $300, and she only got $220, the difference is $300 - $220 = $80. So, $80 was withheld from Sally’s wage.

80"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests:
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves:
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"Okay, so Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She's already done 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we first need to figure out how many pages she's already written. 

1/3 of 15 pages is 5 pages. So, she's written 5 pages so far. 

To find out how many pages she has left, we subtract the pages she's already written from the total number of pages:

15 pages - 5 pages = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"Okay, so Mike has to read a 200-page book for his homework, and he's got 30 days to do it. He plans to read 10 pages every day. 

To figure out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Mike 20 days to finish the book. Since he has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it takes him to read the book from the total number of days he has:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much James spends on the plane itself. The plane costs $150,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much he spends on the hanger each month. He pays $5,000 a month for the hanger.

Then, we need to figure out how much he spends on fuel each month. He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 a month on fuel.

Now, let's add the hanger and fuel costs together to find out how much he spends each month on maintenance:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 a month.

To find out how much he spends on maintenance for the whole year, we multiply the monthly maintenance cost by 12:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000 for the year.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know it took 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the pork took:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The beans took half the combined cooking time of the pork and rice. The combined cooking time of the pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, the beans took:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it took 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the cost of each type of nut mixture.

For the first mixture:
- 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we did in high school math class.

We know that:
- The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's use:
- \( S \) for the number of sheep.
- \( G \) for the number of geese.

We can set up two equations based on the information given:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"Okay, so Roger usually buys coffee that costs $5 a pound. But this time, he had to get a different kind that's 20% more expensive. First, let's figure out how much that more expensive coffee costs.

20% of $5 is $1 (because 20% is the same as 0.20, and 0.20 times 5 is 1). So, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1, which is $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee each day, and he's buying enough for a week, which is 7 days. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. At $6 per pound, that's 7 times 6, which equals $42 for the coffee.

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost for everything is $42 for the coffee plus $2 for the donut, which is $44.

So, everything costs $44.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought:

- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding those up: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

So, if he spent $20.00 in total, the rest must have gone to the apple pie. 

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. To find out how many newspapers he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers.

So, we do:
600 (total newspapers) - 198 (District A) - 209 (District C)

Let's do the math:
600 - 198 = 402
402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

193"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours John spends in the cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week, and each session is 2 hours long. So, in one week, he spends:

4 times a week * 2 hours each time = 8 hours per week

The class runs for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours he spends in the class is:

8 hours per week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:

48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

So, John learns 32 recipes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we calculate:
\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]
So, there are 90 history teachers.

Next, we need to find out how many of the teachers are math teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]
So, there are 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours the math teachers collectively sleep in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:
\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 360 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has. So, we calculate Kassidy's amount:

\[ \text{Kassidy's amount} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we calculate Rayna's amount:

\[ \text{Rayna's amount} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

If they decide to share this money equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

"Okay, so let's figure this out. Sarah's basketball game has 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, first, we need to find out how long the game is without any extra time. We do this by multiplying the number of quarters by the length of each quarter:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Now, since the game was tied at the end of the fourth quarter, they added 5 more minutes to the game. So, we need to add those 5 minutes to the total time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

   20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 management employees.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. The problem says 30% of the management employees do this. So, we calculate 30% of 10:
   \[
   30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3

   So, 3 employees oversee the entire company.

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is:

"To figure out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's look at what she needs for one muffin:
- 5 tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 0.25 tablespoons of salt

Now, we need to multiply each of these by 16 because she's making 16 muffins.

For the flour:
5 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons

For the sugar:
3 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons

For the salt:
0.25 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add all these together to get the total amount of dry ingredients:
80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount of candy equally among the three of them:

12 pounds ÷ 3 people = 4 pounds per person

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Adam spent on the candies. He bought 7 candies of type A, and each one costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
7 * $0.5 = $3.5

Next, he bought 10 candies of type B, and each one costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
10 * $0.75 = $7.5

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total amount he spent from what he paid:
$15 - $11 = $4

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that over the past 30 days, Christina had:
- 12 good days
- 8 bad days
- The rest were neutral days

To find out how many neutral days there were, we subtract the good and bad days from the total:
- Total days: 30
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Next, we know the distribution of these days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The next 8 days were neutral.
- The last 6 days are what we need to figure out.

Now, the next three days are:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good

So, the last 6 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral)

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 6 days: 2 good days

Total good days in the 30 days:
- 8 + 2 = 10 good days

We know from the problem that there were 12 good days in total. So, the remaining good days are:
- 12 - 10 = 2 good days

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Janey has 21 books, and we know that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. We can set up an equation to solve for the number of books Sally has.

Let's call the number of books Sally has \( S \).

The problem says that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

First, we need to get rid of the 3 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we need to solve for \( S \). We do this by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how tall the bamboo is right now in inches. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, if the bamboo is 20 feet tall, we multiply 20 by 12:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the desired height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches each day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. Then, 8 more dogs join the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs.
3. After buying these toys, he finds out there are now twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 24 dogs now.
4. He needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs.
5. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 21 dogs.
6. He already has 12 toys, so he needs to buy 9 more toys to have one for each of the 21 dogs.

Now, let's add up all the toys:
- Initial toys: 4
- First purchase: 8
- Second purchase: 12
- Final purchase: 9

Total toys needed: 4 + 8 + 12 + 9 = 33

So, James needs a total of 33 toys.

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. So, we calculate Frances's investment:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Finally, Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Next, the problem tells us that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have:
\[ 73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, the problem says that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have:
\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they all have together. We add up the cookies:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's do the addition:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ 298 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's call the original length of the dress \( L \).

Shania makes the dress 50% longer, so the new length is \( L + 0.5L \), which is the same as \( 1.5L \).

Then, she adds 20cm of lace trim to the bottom, so the final length is \( 1.5L + 20 \).

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can write the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Now, let's solve for \( L \).

First, subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

80"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Chris can mow his entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, if he mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it will take him half of 60 minutes:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Chris can mow his entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes. So, if he mows half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it will take him half of 40 minutes:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They spend 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and then they spend another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

To find out how much time they have left, we need to add the time they spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time they've already used from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

11"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas, and each kilo costs $2, so 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges, and each kilo costs $3, so 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add it all up:
- Apples: $4
- Bananas: $4
- Oranges: $6

Total cost: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays $14 in total."
"Okay, so Greta baked 30 cookies. Celinda baked twice as many, which means Celinda baked 60 cookies. Together, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. But they ate 10 of the cookies while they were cooling. So, the number of cookies left to put in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

80"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we would in a high school math class.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know two things:
1. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets.
2. The combined ages of all the twins and triplets add up to 44.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we know the combined ages of the twins and triplets:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Let's simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R = 6 \), we can find \( T \):
\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

13"
"Okay, let's figure this out. John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. That's 3 hours times 60 minutes in an hour, so he has 180 minutes. He needs to do 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. If we add up all the homework time, that's 20 + 40 + 20, which equals 80 minutes. 

So, if John has 180 minutes before dinner and he needs to spend 80 minutes on homework, he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left to take a nap.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong. First, we need to find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong.

2/5 of 20 coins is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

To find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add Rong's and Neil's savings:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
5760"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much the vaccines cost. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each one costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). So, the heartworm check costs:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of the crate of fruit. 

First, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs:
- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- There are 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- There are 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6\) dollars.
- There are 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total cost of the crate:
- Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars

So, the price for the crate of fruit is 32 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure out how many square feet Brittany's quilted comforter is.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

So, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many chairs are needed in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so we add these together:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]
So, we need 57 chairs in total.

Next, we need to check how many chairs the restaurant already has. The restaurant has 8 high chairs and 5 times as many regular chairs. So, we calculate the number of regular chairs:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
So, the restaurant has 40 regular chairs.

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs the restaurant currently has:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]
So, the restaurant has 48 chairs.

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant has from the total number of chairs needed:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"Okay, let's figure out how many points the class needs to go on the trip.

First, we know:
- Adam has 50 points.
- Betty has 30% more points than Adam.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- Marta has 3 times more points than Tom.

Let's calculate each person's points step by step:

1. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty has 30% more points than Adam.
   - 30% of 50 is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \).
   - So, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.

2. **Tom's Points:**
   - Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - So, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.

3. **Marta's Points:**
   - Marta has 3 times more points than Tom.
   - So, Marta has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points collected by the class:
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
\[ 400 - 255 = 145 \]

So, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

145"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own. So, the number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children of their own. So, the number of great grand-babies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great grand-babies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great grand-babies}
   \]

So, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of it into her retirement account. So, we need to find out what 50% of $2400.00 is:
\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. So, we need to find out what 20% of $2400.00 is:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement and her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. They have 15 boxes, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:
15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Next, we need to figure out how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her house. She can see 40% of them. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.40:
300 * 0.40 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's look at the fireworks Hannah is setting off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, we multiply 3 by 5:
3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself:
120 + 15 = 135 fireworks

So, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of people:**
   - Aiden and his 12 friends: 1 + 12 = 13
   - They meet up with 7 more friends: 13 + 7 = 20

2. **Total number of seats:**
   - Each person saves a seat, so there are 20 seats.

3. **Drinks and snacks per seat:**
   - Each seat holds 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

4. **Total drinks and snacks:**
   - Total drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
   - Total snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

5. **Cost of drinks and snacks:**
   - Each drink costs $2, so the total cost for drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
   - Each snack costs $2, so the total cost for snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

6. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for drinks and snacks: $80 + $120 = $200

So, the group has spent a total of 200 dollars on snacks and drinks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary's trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we need to subtract the total amount that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the combined total:

11,600 pounds (total) - 4,000 pounds (Gissela's truck) - 4,800 pounds (Gordy's truck) = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females. Each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100 in a 3:2 ratio. That means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, let's figure out how much each part is worth:
- Total parts = 3 + 2 = 5
- Each part = $100 / 5 = $20

Now, let's find out how much Gerald got:
- Gerald's share = 3 parts * $20 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract that from his share:
- Money left = $60 - $10 = $50

So, Gerald has $50 left."
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. If Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second and is 5 times faster than her turtle, we need to find out how fast the turtle can go.

First, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to get the turtle's speed:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} \div 5 = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we know the turtle moves at 3 feet per second. To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Find out how much they raise per hour:**
   - They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
   - So, the amount raised per hour is $2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour.

2. **Calculate how much more they need to raise:**
   - Their goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - So, they still need to raise $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

3. **Determine how many more hours they need to fundraise:**
   - They raise $700 per hour.
   - To raise $4200, they need $4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for industrial purposes:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Next, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes. We do this by subtracting the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

8%"
"Okay, so if Alex charges $12 for each day of tutoring, and there are 7 days in a week, then for 2 weeks, that's 14 days. So, we just need to multiply 14 days by $12 per day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so:
\[ \text{Chocolate ice cream per hour} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in one hour. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so:
\[ \text{Vanilla ice cream per hour} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much of each type of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
\[ \text{Chocolate ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \]

For vanilla ice cream:
\[ \text{Vanilla ice cream in 48 hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
\[ \text{Total quarts} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

"Okay, let's figure out Marcus's total bill step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he bought:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up all these costs to get the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. So, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total before the discount:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus's total bill is $45.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

The ice cream parlor has a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many days are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After 14 days, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how much of the bathroom Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, we need to find out how many tiles are needed for 24 square feet:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

576"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. There's a fixed cost of $20 just to go picking, and then it costs $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picks. James picked 30 pounds, so we calculate the cost of the blueberries like this:

Cost of blueberries = 30 pounds * $1.5 per pound = $45

Now, we add the fixed cost to the cost of the blueberries:

Total cost to pick = $20 (fixed cost) + $45 (cost of blueberries) = $65

Next, we need to find out how much it would have cost James to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, so:

Cost to buy = 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75

Finally, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the total cost to pick from the cost to buy:

Savings = $75 (cost to buy) - $65 (total cost to pick) = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The company planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each.
2. But the price went up by 10%. So, we need to find out what 10% of $700 is:
   \[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
3. The new price of each computer is:
   \[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]
4. Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 500 computers at the new price:
   \[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how many calories are in John's omelet. 

First, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from the eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
- So, the total calories from the cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

Then, we calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same amount as the cheese).
- Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
- So, the total calories from the ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80

Total calories in the omelet: \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
6 pencils * $0.50/pencil = $3.00

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
8 erasers * $0.25/eraser = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to get the total cost:
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

You paid $10, so to find out how much change you get, we subtract the total cost from $10:
$10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

So, the change you would get is $5.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **First, figure out how many people get interviews:**
   - 100 people apply for the job.
   - 30% of these people get interviews.
   - To find 30% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.30.
   - \( 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \)
   - So, 30 people get interviews.

2. **Next, figure out how many of those who get interviews receive a job offer:**
   - 20% of the 30 people who get interviews receive a job offer.
   - To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.20.
   - \( 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \)
   - So, 6 people receive a job offer.

3. **Finally, figure out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position:**
   - One-third of the 6 people who receive a job offer accept the position.
   - To find one-third of 6, we divide 6 by 3.
   - \( 6 \div 3 = 2 \)
   - So, 2 people accept the position.

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is:

First, we need to find out how many sacks of rice Goldy gave away in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, we add these together:

3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice are in these 7 sacks. Each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. So, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight per sack:

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, Goldy gave away 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many taps Helga makes with each foot when her arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

1. **When her arms are at her sides:**
   - She dances for 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes total and 2 minutes with her arms raised).
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute.
   - Total taps for the right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\).
   - Total taps for the left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\).

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - She dances for 2 minutes.
   - Right foot: 200 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 200 taps per minute.
   - Total taps for the right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\).
   - Total taps for the left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\).

3. **Total taps for both feet:**
   - Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\).
   - Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\).
   - Combined total taps: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450 \text{ taps}\).

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, his car will get damaged and it will cost him $450.
2. If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
3. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25. So, the total cost for the asphalt is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
4. Adding the fine and the cost of the asphalt, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is:
   \[
   120 + 75 = 195
   \]
5. To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the cost of the damage:
   \[
   450 - 195 = 255
   \]

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many chairs the restaurant had to start with:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

So, the total number of chairs is:
170 + 23 = 193

Next, we need to find out how many chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

So, the total number of chairs sent for repair is:
20 + 13 = 33

Now, to find out how many chairs are left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many slices of pizza there are in total. Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people, so:

5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Next, we need to figure out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They each ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So for each of them:

2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices

Since there are 3 people (Bryce and two friends), the total number of slices they ate is:

3 people * 8 slices per person = 24 slices

Now, let's look at the remaining two friends. They each ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So for each of them:

3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices

Since there are 2 people, the total number of slices they ate is:

2 people * 9 slices per person = 18 slices

Now, we add up all the slices eaten by everyone:

24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to find out how many slices are left:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 18. 

18"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. That's pretty straightforward.

Next, we're told that a dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. So, we need to find out what 2/3 of 30 minutes is:
\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time it takes the cat and the time it takes the dog, and then divide by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, 8 feet is 8 times 12 inches, which is 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many windows are in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many windows are in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, Hannah smashed 112 windows in total.

112"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many spools of thread Candy has in total. We add up all the spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add up the blue spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the numbers:
\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Convert to a percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

40%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote. By midday, 2/5 of these people had already voted. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ 5000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means that 3000 people were still waiting to vote.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ 3000 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. This means that the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack has 15 pieces, so:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many smores everyone wants to eat. 

- There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 smores. So, the kids will eat:
  9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

- There are 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 smore. So, the adults will eat:
  6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores.

Now, let's add the smores for the kids and the adults to get the total number of smores needed:
18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores.

Next, we need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed. Each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve can make:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed. Each box contains 3 sleeves. So, we divide the total number of sleeves by the number of sleeves per box:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. 

The problem says Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate Dora's father's age like this:
- Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
- Eight more than that is \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can find Dora's mother's age by subtracting 4 from Dora's father's age:
- \(38 - 4 = 34\).

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
- \(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\).

So, the total combined age is 87."

- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes candidate A got:
- 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Next, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we need to find out what 50% more than 20 votes is:
- 50% of 20 = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
- Therefore, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C got. We know the total number of votes is 100, and we already have the votes for candidates A and B:
- Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
- So, the votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Candidate C got 50 votes.

So, Beck has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck, after receiving 10 apples, will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube:

- For the giant cubes, each one uses 4 ounces of water. Since he makes 3 giant cubes, he uses:
  \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

- For the medium cubes, each one uses 2 ounces of water. Since he makes 7 medium cubes, he uses:
  \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

- For the small cubes, each one uses 0.5 ounces of water. Since he makes 8 small cubes, he uses:
  \[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we add up all the water used for the ice cubes:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books. It's also given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. So, if we divide Clara's books by 2, we can find out how many books Steven has:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, if we add 6 to the number of books Steven has, we can find out how many books Alice has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also tells us that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, to find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, we multiply the number of gallon jars by the cost per gallon jar:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, we multiply the number of half-gallon jars by the cost per half-gallon jar:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

The problem also tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like basketball, the number of students who like music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find out how many students are left who like to play video games. We subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 25 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we're told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

First, Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards, and each pack costs $1800. So, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's figure out how much he makes from selling the cards. He gets:
- One card worth $4000
- Another card worth $1000
- 30 more cards, each worth $50 on average

The total value of the 30 cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Now, add up all the money he makes from selling the cards:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find out how much profit he made, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark's profit is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first one.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for each park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

So, the total cost for the first park is:
\[ 2 \text{ adults} \times \$26/\text{adult} = \$52 \]
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times \$12/\text{child} = \$24 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for the first park} = \$52 + \$24 = \$76 \]

Now, for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14.
- The cost for each child is $10.
- There are still 2 adults and 2 children.

So, the total cost for the second park is:
\[ 2 \text{ adults} \times \$14/\text{adult} = \$28 \]
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times \$10/\text{child} = \$20 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for the second park} = \$28 + \$20 = \$48 \]

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second park, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ \$76 - \$48 = \$28 \]

So, Jake's family will save \(\$28\) by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

28"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the tomato vendor used to spend on tomatoes each day. He used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each. So, the daily cost was:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250 \]

Next, we need to find out how much he spends now with the new vendor. The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each. So, the new daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200 \]

Now, we can find out how much he saves each day by subtracting the new daily cost from the old daily cost:
\[ \$250 - \$200 = \$50 \]

To find out how much he saves in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \$50 \times 7 = \$350 \]

So, the vendor saves \$350 a week.

350"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. 

Next, it says Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we multiply Sean's marbles by 4:
\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \]
So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Then, it says Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, we multiply Sean's marbles by 2 to find out how many Cal has:
\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We add Carl's and Cal's marbles together:
\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined. 

336"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we have 54 students and they need to be divided into 6 groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide 54 by 6:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

So, each group has 9 students.

Now, the activity requires 12 groups instead of 6. Since the total number of students remains the same (54 students), we need to figure out how many more groups are needed to make 12 groups.

We already have 6 groups, so we need:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, we need 6 more groups.

6"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many weekdays and weekends there are in two 4-week months.

1. **Weekdays and Weekends:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
   - In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

2. **Chairs Rented on Weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).

3. **Chairs Rented on Weekends:**
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
   - Total chairs rented on weekends: \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

4. **Total Chairs Rented:**
   - Add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends: \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\).

So, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

4000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of them. Half of 48 is 24, so Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas to his pile:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Later that evening, Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther adds 6 more bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, Gunther finds 43 bananas in the pile."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the total electricity bill is for the whole year. Since the bill is $100 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply:

\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \]

So, the total electricity bill for the year is $1200.

Next, we need to divide this total cost equally among Jenna and her 4 roommates. That means there are 5 people sharing the cost. So, we divide the total cost by 5:

\[ 1200 \div 5 = 240 \]

Therefore, each roommate, including Jenna, will pay $240 per year for electricity.

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many glasses and plates Jeff sent to the party. 

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
- He also sent 4 dozen plates. So, 4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Next, we need to account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
- 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find out how many items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now. 

128"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

3. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - So, 20 large stickers are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

4. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

6. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - So, 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Small Buttons (Final Count):**
   - From small stickers: 87 small buttons.
   - From large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \) small buttons.

So, by the end, Lorraine has 147 buttons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, he played 1 match.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so that's 2 times 2, which equals 4 matches.

Now, let's add them all up:
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

7"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know there are 33 people on the council, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against.

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). Then, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, so:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice that, we have:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Okay, let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for the field trip.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - So, 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"Okay, so if the bag is marked at $140 and there's a 5% discount, we need to figure out how much the discount is and then subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 5% of $140:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.05 \times 140 = 7 \]

So, the discount is $7.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133.

133"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists combined. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply 300 by 20:

\[ 300 \times 20 = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many hours all these songs will last. Each song is 10 hours long, so we multiply the total number of songs by 10:

\[ 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We know that 20% of 50 people think this. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after we take out the 10 people who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate 60% of 40:

60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we need to find out how many people are left who think horse #12 will win. We subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people who are left:

40 people - 24 people = 16 people

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

16"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if 6 is one third of the total Pomeranians, we can find the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying 6 by 3:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, there are 18 Pomeranians.

2. The problem also tells us that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
   \]
   To solve for the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"Okay, so Jayden has $70 from selling his pictures. His sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more to buy the camera.

85"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say the number of cases of shingles the first house needs is \( x \).

The problem says:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which means:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, Leila spent:
3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack bought 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, Jack spent:
5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3. So, Chase spent:
1 lettuce * $3/lettuce = $3

Now, to find out how much they all spent together, we add up their individual costs:
$6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14

So, the total amount they spent to make the salad is $14.

14"
"Okay, so George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than bananas. First, let's figure out how many more pears that is:

45% of 200 bananas is:
\[ 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. That means he has:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \] pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the bananas and the pears:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, George has 490 fruits in total.

490"
"Okay, so Marissa had $80 and she spent $20 on a ball. That means she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. If each candy bar costs $5, then the number of candy bars she could buy is $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To figure out how much Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice. So, for 4 liters, he would need:
\[ 5 \text{ kg} \times 4 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be:
\[ 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

60"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Ezra read 300 books in one hour. That's a lot of books! Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can figure out how many books Ahmed read by dividing Ezra's total by 2:
\[ 300 \div 2 = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, we add these 150 books to the 300 books Ezra already read:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]
So, Ezra will have read 450 books in total.

To find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, together, they have read 600 books.

600"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya earned over the two days.

**Monday:**
- Tanya taught 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she teaches.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day.

First, calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, add the extra $5 for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $80 on Monday.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya taught 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she teaches.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5 for the day.

Calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $30 on Wednesday.

**Total Earnings:**
Add the earnings from both days:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of $110 for the two days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many vanilla scents were sold in total. The company has 4 different vanilla scents, and they sold 5 of each. So, we multiply the number of vanilla scents by the number sold for each:

\[ 4 \text{ vanilla scents} \times 5 \text{ sold each} = 20 \text{ vanilla scents sold} \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruity scents were sold in total. The company has 8 different fruity scents, and they sold 2 of each. So, we multiply the number of fruity scents by the number sold for each:

\[ 8 \text{ fruity scents} \times 2 \text{ sold each} = 16 \text{ fruity scents sold} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. We subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold:

\[ 20 \text{ vanilla scents sold} - 16 \text{ fruity scents sold} = 4 \]

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, we multiply 20 by 3:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the $60 he already made from his goal:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 more from selling his 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the $75 by the 25 ears of corn:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many hours Tatiana has in total over the weekend:
- On Saturday, she has 7 hours.
- On Sunday, she has 5 hours.
So, in total, she has 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract that from the total time:
- 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left for other activities.

She also plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours:
- 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours for video games.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time:
- 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left for playing soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
- (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
- (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. 

50%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we calculate 3/5 of 25. 

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back. The museum is 150 miles away, and he drives at 75 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes to drive one way, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for one way:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives to the museum and back, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the driving time and the time spent at the museum:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has 57 cars to assemble. So, we multiply 57 by 4:
\[ 57 \times 4 = 228 \]
So, Henry needs 228 wheels for the cars.

Next, we need to find out how many wheels he needs for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has 73 motorcycles to assemble. So, we multiply 73 by 2:
\[ 73 \times 2 = 146 \]
So, Henry needs 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \]
So, Henry needs 374 wheels in total.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \]

So, the number of wheels left is 276. 

276"
"Okay, so if a laptop costs $1000 and you get a 20% discount, you first need to figure out what 20% of $1000 is. You do this by multiplying $1000 by 20% (or 0.20):

$1000 * 0.20 = $200

This means the discount is $200. Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much you have to pay:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - These series movies cost only \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the normal movie price.
   - Normal movie price: $10
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 1.67 = 334 \) dollars (rounded to the nearest dollar)

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $334
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 334 + 800 + 2400 = 3534 \) dollars

So, the total cost to replace all the movies is:
3534"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Winston spent at the fruit orchard.

First, we calculate the cost for each type of fruit:
- Peaches: 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound = 6 * 2 = $12.00
- Plums: 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound = 8 * 1 = $8.00
- Apricots: 6 pounds at $3.00 per pound = 6 * 3 = $18.00

Next, we add up the costs:
- Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"Okay, let's figure out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is.

First, we need to find out how long they actually drove. They spent a total of 6 hours traveling, and 1.5 hours of that was hiking. So, the time they spent driving is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they drove is:
\[ 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's figure out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is:
\[ 50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance they hiked is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
\[ 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

255 miles"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, let's set up what we know:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's break down the scoring:
- Each enemy gives 10 points.
- Each berry gives 5 points.
- Each second left on the timer gives 30 points.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the number of seconds Emma has left on the timer.

So, Emma's score is:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Now, for Ava:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Ava's score is:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]

Let's expand and simplify Ava's score:
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Now, let's find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 - 10E - 5B - 30T \]
\[ -25 \]

So, the difference between their scores is:
25

Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score."
"Okay, so four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas together cost 30 dollars. To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we first need to figure out how much money was left after the first two pizzas were paid for.

So, 64 dollars minus 30 dollars is 34 dollars. This 34 dollars is the total cost for the other two pizzas. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide 34 dollars by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 dollars divided by 2 is 17 dollars.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, for those 5 days, the total number of rides is:
3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, on two other days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days. Since they usually ride 3 times a day, on these special days, they ride:
2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

For those 2 special days, the total number of rides is:
6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Now, to find the total number of rides in a week, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're working through a high school math problem.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob starts with 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob buys 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's say he buys \( x \) white fish and \( y \) orange fish.
   - So, \( x + y = 17 \).

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - This means \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \).

5. **Solve the Equations:**
   - First, simplify the condition equation:
     \[
     3 + y = 2(4 + x)
     \]
     \[
     3 + y = 8 + 2x
     \]
     \[
     y = 8 + 2x - 3
     \]
     \[
     y = 5 + 2x
     \]

   - Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation \( x + y = 17 \):
     \[
     x + (5 + 2x) = 17
     \]
     \[
     x + 5 + 2x = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x + 5 = 17
     \]
     \[
     3x = 12
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
   - Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
   - Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
   - Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
   - Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

First, we need to know how far Andy drives each day. He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much gas he uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so for 50 miles, he uses:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much this gas costs. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to figure out how much money Carrie got from the quarters and the twenties.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - So, the total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

2. **Twenties:**
   - Carrie has 10 twenties.
   - Each twenty is worth $20.
   - So, the total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much of the twenties she spent. The problem says she spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.

3. **Amount of twenties spent:**
   - \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 200 dollars is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on the twenties to get the total amount spent on lunch.

4. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Amount spent on quarters + Amount spent on twenties
   - Total amount spent = 35 dollars + 120 dollars = 155 dollars

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
155"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Ricardo gets from his tomato plants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. So, we multiply 22 by 5:
\[ 22 \times 5 = 110 \]
So, Ricardo gets 110 tomatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many eggplants he gets. Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, we multiply 4 by 8:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
So, Ricardo gets 32 eggplants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[ 110 + 32 = 142 \]

So, Ricardo can get a total of 142 fruits from his plants.

142"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the total number of TVs sold is 40. Out of these, one-fourth are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. We need to find out how many are OLED TVs.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs:
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25
   \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"Okay, so let's break this down. The trip costs $300 in total. The school is being really nice and covering half of that, so they're paying $150. John has $50 saved up. To find out how much more John needs, we subtract what's already covered from the total cost:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's money) = $100

So, John still needs $100 to cover the cost of the trip.

100"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how cold it gets at night. The problem says it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day. If it's 45 degrees during the day, then at night it will be:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Next, we need to make sure the house stays above 32 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many groups of 9 people can be made from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought back by these groups is:

\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

108"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with 172 people on the train.

At the first stop:
- 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172: \(172 - 47 = 125\)
- Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125: \(125 + 13 = 138\)

So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

At the next stop:
- 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138: \(138 - 38 = 100\)

So, after the second stop, there are 100 people on the train.

"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day on his way home. Each bottle cap is worth 25 cents, or $0.25. To figure out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we need to do a bit of math.

First, let's find out how many bottle caps he finds in 30 days:
10 bottle caps/day × 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Next, we need to convert the bottle caps into dollars. Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25:
300 bottle caps × $0.25/bottle cap = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

75"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jamie made last Tuesday.

First, we need to know how much she makes for her regular 8 hours of work. Jamie earns $20 per hour, so for 8 hours, she makes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate her pay for the extra hours she worked. Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so the extra hours are:
\[ 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. Her regular rate is $20 per hour, so her overtime rate is:
\[ 150\% \times \$20/\text{hour} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the 3 overtime hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

"Okay, so the zookeeper counted 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 divided by 2, so that's 6 male lions. She also counted 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, you add all these numbers together: 12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs. 

So, 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in total.

32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10.

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30.

Now, if Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much change he will get back. We subtract the sale price from the amount he pays with:

\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial number of employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New hires each month**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Number of months**: We need to calculate for 3 months.

First, let's find out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we add these new employees to the initial number of employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount paid over 3 months:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Billy's Starting Pay:**
   - Billy started at $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's First Raise:**
   - After 2 months, Billy got a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - So, his new pay rate was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, Billy got another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his new pay rate was $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Pay:**
   - Sally started at a rate that was $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate.
   - So, Sally's starting pay was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, he earns $11.50 * 20 = $230.
   - Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, she earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

   - So, the total number of students is \( 40 \times 25 = 1000 \) students.

2. **Number of Teachers:**
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has 3 teachers.
   - So, the total number of teachers is \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) teachers.

Next, we need to calculate how many trees each group plants.

3. **Trees Planted by Students:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - So, the total number of trees planted by students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \) trees.

4. **Trees Planted by Teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \) trees.

Finally, we add the trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted.

5. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
   - Total trees = \( 1000 + 240 = 1240 \) trees

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many stuffed animals Bubbles has right now. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

So, the total number of stuffed animals she has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total collection. Let's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of this total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far each car travels in 2 hours.

1. The first car is going 60 miles per hour. So, in 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second car is going 70 miles per hour. So, in 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, to find out how many miles apart they are after 2 hours, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled:
\[
140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
\]

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:
- 30% of $900 is 0.30 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out how much James paid:
- Total cost of materials: $900
- Premium: $270
- Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"Okay, let's figure out the school's overall pass rate step by step.

First, we need to know how many students passed in each grade and the total number of students in each grade.

- For the third graders:
  - 340 out of 500 passed.
  
- For the fourth graders:
  - 40 out of 100 passed.
  
- For the fifth graders:
  - The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders. The fourth graders' pass rate is 40 out of 100, which is 40%.
  - So, the fifth graders' pass rate is 2 * 40% = 80%.
  - 80% of 400 fifth graders is 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Next, we add up the number of students who passed in all grades:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 320
- Total passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Now, we add up the total number of students in all grades:
- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400
- Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:
- Overall pass rate = (Total passed / Total students) * 100
- Overall pass rate = (700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

70%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has two bags, and each bag has 72 chips. So, we multiply:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic these 144 chips can cover. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide:
\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips per square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long the mosaic can be, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. 

4 inches"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much tea was drunk by the students. 

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea they drank is:
  \[
  4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea they drank is:
  \[
  16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Next, we add the amounts of tea drunk by both groups of students:
\[
6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
\]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[
38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
\]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[
48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

12"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he sold all 100 he had and needed 50 more to fulfill the orders. To cover the extra 50 candies he sold, he ordered 100 more candies. After fulfilling the 150 sold, he has 50 candies left (100 ordered - 50 needed).

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

50"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. We need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May.

1. **End of January:** The number of students doubles from 10 to \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
2. **End of February:** The number of students doubles from 20 to \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
3. **End of March:** The number of students doubles from 40 to \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
4. **End of April:** The number of students doubles from 80 to \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
5. **End of May:** The number of students doubles from 160 to \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students on campus.

To find out how many additional students have joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:
\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"Okay, so Felix charges 25 cents for each branch he climbs to get stuff out of trees. He made $105 in a week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

That's the total number of branches he climbed in a week. To find out how many branches he climbed on average each day, we divide the total branches by the number of days in a week:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

But, she drops 1 of each type of flower. So, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The bag has 35 marshmallows.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
3. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
4. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, let's add up all the marshmallows that were used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Now, subtract the total used and lost marshmallows from the original number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left. Since there are 2 kids (John and DeSean), we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

7"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step. Tanya is making a salt scrub and she uses different ingredients in specific amounts. Here's what we know:

- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's use a variable to make it easier. Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Now, the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Now, solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

So, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much John spent on the goats. He bought 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, we multiply the number of goats by the cost of each goat:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the cows. He bought 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, we multiply the number of cows by the cost of each cow:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, to find the total amount of money John spent, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent a total of $4500.

4500"
"Okay, so Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones. Let's add those up: 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. Now, to find out how many more he needs, we subtract the number he has from the total he needs: 63 - 48 = 15. So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. We subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

6250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, we need to find half of 8 hours:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Hunter counted 50 cars when he first got to school.
2. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars join the parking lot. So, we add those 20 cars to the 50 cars he already counted:
   \[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]
   Now there are 70 cars in the parking lot.
3. When Hunter got out for lunch, he noticed that half of the cars had left. So, we need to find half of 70:
   \[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]
   This means 35 cars left the parking lot.
4. To find out how many cars were left in the parking lot during lunch, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars:
   \[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many tasks John does in one day. John does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he does in one day is:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in one day. Each task pays $1.20, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we need to calculate his earnings for a full 7-day week. If he earns $180 per day, then in a week he earns:
\[ \$180 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260 \text{ per week} \]

So, John makes:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that in the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points} \]

Next, in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is:
\[ 18 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages, and each package has 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]
So, Kimberly bought 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food she bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]
So, Kimberly bought 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( P \). Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ blue eggs}
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ pink eggs}
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ yellow eggs}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Milly will lose.

First, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away. So, the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add these two costs together to get the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much Milly will get refunded by Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money Milly will lose. She initially paid $32 for the book, she will get $24 back, and she will also pay $3 for shipping. So, her net loss is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Milly will lose:
\[ 11 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Mulan has $40. Her dad gives her $100 more, so:
$40 + $100 = $140

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans. Each pair costs $30, so:
2 * $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount she spends is:
$60 + $20 = $80

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she had:
$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. Here's what he makes each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up what he makes in the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

14,000"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, the total time spent recording videos each week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes recording videos.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes writing songs.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.
   - So, the total time spent doing makeup each week is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes doing makeup.

Now, let's add up all the time spent on these activities in a month:
- Time spent recording videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \] minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost Angela to have everything installed.

The interior design firm charges $129.00 for a standard installation, which includes:
- Hanging 4 mirrors
- Installing 2 shelves
- Hanging 1 chandelier
- Hanging 10 pictures

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's see how many extra items Angela needs installed:
- She needs 2 more mirrors (6 - 4 = 2)
- She needs 1 more chandelier (2 - 1 = 1)
- She needs 10 more pictures (20 - 10 = 10)

So, Angela needs 13 extra items installed (2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures).

The cost for each extra item is $15.00. So, the cost for 13 extra items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

Now, let's add the cost of the extra items to the base installation fee:
$129.00 (base fee) + $195.00 (extra items) = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela will be:

324"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much 40% of Anthony's savings is, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]
So, 40% of $30.00 is $12.00.

To find out how much Roy has saved, we add this $12.00 to Anthony's savings:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - So, \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Okay, so Mason is riding his bike at 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, then takes a break, and rides for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his trip and then add them together.

First, for the 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, for the 6 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles. 

80"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a problem in high school math class.

First, we need to figure out how fast the kangaroos are going. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can think of it this way: the total distance they cover is the same as if one kangaroo went the whole distance, but it's shared among the 3 kangaroos. So, the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway is:

\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 3 = 54 \text{ hours} \]

This means one kangaroo would take 54 hours to cross the highway by itself.

Next, we need to figure out how fast the turtles are. The problem says each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. If a kangaroo takes 54 hours to cross, a turtle, being half as fast, would take twice as long:

\[ 54 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 108 \text{ hours} \]

But we have 4 turtles, and they're all moving at the same time. So, the total speed of 4 turtles is 4 times the speed of one turtle. This means the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway is:

\[ \frac{108 \text{ hours}}{4} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

2. She can trade in her old laptop, which reduces the price by $200. So, the new price of the laptop is:
   \[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80 to help.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's add up all the money Erika has:
- Money from her part-time job: $150
- Money from her mom: $80
- Total from these sources: 
  \[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Erika has in her purse. We know the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $400, and she still needs $50 more. So, the amount she already has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Since she has $230 from her part-time job and her mom, the rest must be in her purse:
\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

120"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple gives 5 slices and he has 3 large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples. Each small apple gives 3 slices and he has 5 small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

So, the number of apple slices left is:
15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that one cow gives 5 liters of milk a day. The farmer has 3 cows, so the total milk from these cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. So, we need to find out how much more milk is needed:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ 10 \text{ liters/day} \div 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is left. We know the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add up the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much everything costs in total. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800. So, we add these together:
\[ 10,000 + 800 = 10,800 \]

Next, we need to know how much money Gabriel already has. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother. So, we add these together:
\[ 5,000 + 200 = 5,200 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
\[ 10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

5600"
"Okay, so Thea bought a hat for $70 in Bali. She paid with four $20 bills, which means she gave the craftsman $80. To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount she gave:

$80 - $70 = $10

So, Thea got $10 in change.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys six squirt guns, each costing $2. So the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3. So the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount he spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Jack has 60 dishes. The problem says that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have half that number in socks:
\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks:
\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

The problem also states that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes:
\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
\[ 30 \text{ (Jack's socks)} + 60 \text{ (Peter's socks)} = 90 \]

- Total number of dishes:
\[ 60 \text{ (Jack's dishes)} + 30 \text{ (Peter's dishes)} = 90 \]

Finally, the total number of socks and dishes together is:
\[ 90 \text{ (socks)} + 90 \text{ (dishes)} = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
180"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. 

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

So, we have:
- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects:
20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 (both subjects)

Next, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 7 (both subjects) = 12

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how long the whole concert is. The concert is 2 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the concert is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the 10-minute intermission. So, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's figure out how much time each group needs. Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Principal (P):** Brenda invested $300.
2. **Interest Rate (r):** The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the interest rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year.
3. **Time (t):** The investment is for 3 years.

To find the total amount after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal.

4. **Simple Interest (I):** The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 202500
   \]

5. **Total Amount (A):** The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500
   \]
   \[
   A = 202800

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of these shirts have collars, so:
     \[
     \text{White shirts with collars} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:
     \[
     \text{White shirts with no collars} = 40 - 20 = 20
     \]

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of these shirts have buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
     \[
     \text{Floral shirts with no buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30
     \]

3. **Difference:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are compared to white shirts with no collars.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10
     \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Each tray holds 30 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much the farmer will earn by selling these trays. Each tray is sold for $2.5, so we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn:

\[ 75 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. 

- In Farm X, he has 55 goats.
- In Farm Y, he has 45 goats.

He sold some goats from each farm:
- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs each month, and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs like this:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of green food cost. Each basket of green food costs $25, so:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
   So, 3 baskets of green food cost $75.

2. Next, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of red food cost before any discounts. Each basket of red food costs $18, so:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 54
   \]
   So, 3 baskets of red food cost $54 before any discounts.

3. Now, we need to apply the discount. You get $2 off for each basket of red food, and you are buying 3 baskets of red food, so:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
   So, the total discount for the red food is $6.

4. Subtract the total discount from the cost of the red food:
   \[
   54 - 6 = 48
   \]
   So, the cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $48.

5. Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many rooms we need to clean. The motel has 90 rooms, and we only need to clean half of them. So, we divide 90 by 2:

\[ 90 \div 2 = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how long it will take to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each one:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 minutes by 60:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

In the first year, the town plans to build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they did in the first year. So, that's 3 times 12, which equals 36 homes.

Now, in the third year, they will count all the homes they've built so far and then double that number. So, we need to add the homes from the first two years: 12 homes from the first year plus 36 homes from the second year, which gives us 48 homes. Then, they will double this number for the third year, so 48 times 2 equals 96 homes.

Finally, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes from each year: 12 homes from the first year, 36 homes from the second year, and 96 homes from the third year. That's 12 + 36 + 96, which equals 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

I'm three years younger than my brother, so if I'm \( x \) years old, my brother is \( x + 3 \) years old.
I'm also two years older than my sister, so my sister is \( x - 2 \) years old.
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) years old.

The total of all our ages is 87. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks.

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Okay, so let's break this down step by step. On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water passing through it. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, on the second day, the river has \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons of water. On the third day, the river gets an additional 6000 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water on the third day is \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

We start with 10 people who are infected. Each day, every infected person infects 6 more people. We need to find out how many people are infected after 3 days.

**Day 0:**
- We start with 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Now, we have 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Now, we have 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
- The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is:

First, we need to find out how much Rafaela made in tips. Each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip. So, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela made $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta made. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. We subtract this from Rafaela's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta made $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of tips both Rafaela and Julieta received, we add their tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters. So, 2 oranges times 3 daughters equals 6 oranges given to her daughters.

Then, she gave 3 oranges to her only boy. 

So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 (to the daughters) + 3 (to the boy) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the oranges given away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer has 3 oranges left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earning:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - So, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earning:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - So, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - In one year (12 months), Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many burritos were given to the students. There are 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos.
   - So, 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

2. Next, we need to account for the burritos Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos.

3. Now, we add the burritos given to the students and the burritos Mr. George ate to find the total number of burritos used.
   - 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

4. Finally, we subtract the total number of burritos used from the original number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we did in high school math class!

We know that:
1. Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to make it easier:
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we can write these equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.
2. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. So, the sweet potatoes weighed:
   \[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weighed:
   \[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

7"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Greg will spend on jello for his son's birthday party.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs. There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Each box makes 10 jello cups:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Greg will spend:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The electronics seller bought 5 phones, and each phone costs $700. So, the total cost for the phones is:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000 to the electronics seller. To find out how much change the seller should get back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

500"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 on groceries each month. Madeline pays 60% of this amount. So, we need to find out how much that is:

1. Calculate 60% of $400:
   \[
   0.60 \times 400 = 240
   \]
   So, Madeline pays $240.

2. Now, we need to find out how much Keenan pays. Since the total is $400 and Madeline pays $240, we subtract Madeline's share from the total:
   \[
   400 - 240 = 160
   \]
   So, Keenan pays $160 per month.

3. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
   \[
   \frac{160}{4} = 40
   \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

40"
"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces.
   - He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the pieces on the first day.
   - To find out how many pieces he ate, we calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   - So, the total number of pieces he has eaten by the end of the second day is:
     \[
     24 + 10 = 34 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Third Day:**
   - After the second day, the number of pieces left is:
     \[
     60 - 34 = 26 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces.
   - To find out how many pieces he ate, we calculate \( \frac{7}{13} \times 26 \):
     \[
     \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Total Pieces Eaten:**
   - The total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:
     \[
     34 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
     \]

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far. 

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, then one bottle of water costs:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

13.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs $0.03. So, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

This means the total cost for the 16 bolts is $0.48.

Next, we need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has. David has $12.48. So, we do:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

12.00"
"Okay, so Ella made $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she makes in one hour, I'll divide $33 by 3 hours:

\[ \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, Ella makes $11 per hour. If she works for 12 hours, I'll multiply her hourly rate by 12:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours.

132"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, we add those together:
52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total he had:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles

So, Paul has 60 marbles left. 

60"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out how many points Amy scores on her history test.

First, we need to calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
- Amy answers 80% of them correctly.
- Each question is worth 1 point.

So, the number of multiple-choice questions she gets right is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]
And since each question is worth 1 point, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points} \]

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions:
- There are 20 true/false questions.
- Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
- Each question is worth 1 point.

So, the number of true/false questions she gets right is:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]
And since each question is worth 1 point, she earns:
\[ 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points} \]

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions:
- There are 5 long-answer questions.
- Amy answers 60% of them correctly.
- Each question is worth 5 points.

So, the number of long-answer questions she gets right is:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]
And since each question is worth 5 points, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add up all the points she earned:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

So, Amy scores 41 points on her history test.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - Isaias has 300 chickens.
   - He plans to sell 3/5 of them.
   - So, the number of chickens he plans to sell is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken is sold for $50.
   - So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is \( 180 \times 50 = 9000 \).

3. **Determine the cost of the chickens:**
   - Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the cost.
   - So, the cost of the chickens is \( 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \).

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000. 

7000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses (boys)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

18 glasses / 2 = 9 glasses each

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold compared to Micah:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

5"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 of what she spent on her hair for the manicure.

   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure for the pedicure.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa."
"Okay, so Sarah has a rope that's 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. First, let's figure out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah wants to use this money to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she needs 20 meters of it. So, the cost of the new rope is:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope. 

10"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old she is now, we subtract 10 from 18:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

16"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Bacon Cost:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - So, each pack of bacon costs: \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Chicken Cost:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - So, each packet of chicken costs: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is: \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Strawberries Cost:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Apples Cost:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - So, each pack of apples costs: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for bacon: $10
- Total cost for chicken: $24
- Total cost for strawberries: $12
- Total cost for apples: $14

So, the total cost of all the items is:
\[ 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus she does a 15-minute encore. The total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, let's set up the equation. If \( x \) is the length of her usual concerts, then the final concert is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes long.

We know the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can write:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). Start by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, we add up the toys he gave away:
40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the number of toys Argo started with:
200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on both Tuesday and Wednesday. So, for these two days combined, they make:
\[ 125 + 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas} \]

Next, on Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesday. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday, on Friday they make:
\[ 2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas} \]

Now, to find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we add the chimichangas from all three days:
\[ 250 + 250 = 500 \text{ chimichangas} \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:
500"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The singer has 50 microphones, and 20% of them won't fit in pairs. First, we need to find out how many microphones that 20% is:

20% of 50 microphones is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of microphones can be made from 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds flying overhead.
3. Additionally, he sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds feeding.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"Okay, so Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them, so that leaves 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. She then put these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, you divide 50 by 5, which is 50 / 5 = 10 cookies per jar.

10"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many petals all the orchids have together. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals each one has:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, we need to find out how many petals all the daisies have together. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals each one has:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

1. First, we know there are 100 plants in total in Mrs. Smith's garden.
2. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \text{ indoor plants}
   \]
3. Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:
   \[
   100 - 25 = 75 \text{ plants left}
   \]
4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \text{ outdoor plants}
   \]
5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find this by subtracting the outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25 \text{ flowering plants}
   \]
6. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a whirligig, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:
   \[
   \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

So, the speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Ellen eats a salad, a yogurt, and two carrots every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half as much as the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
4. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food.
6. The cost of the two carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.
7. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Mark makes per hour now. He used to make $10 an hour, and they gave him a raise of $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of hours he works in a week is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Earnings**: Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

2. **Mowing Lawns**:
   - First week: Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's.
   - Second week: Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

3. **Determine the Number of Times Tasha Mowed Each Lawn**:
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times.
   - Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - And she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

4. **Total Mowing Times**:
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

5. **Calculate Earnings from Mowing Lawns**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for all her mowing work.
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

6. **Calculate Earnings from Lemonade Sales**:
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

3. Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight. So, Christian’s weight is:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight. So, Harry’s weight is:

So, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it out 10 times, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply 10 by 3:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money he makes from renting the car. He gets paid $25 for each hour. So, we multiply the total hours by $25:

\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find out his profit. His car payment is $500. So, we subtract 500 from 750:

\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John's profit is:
250"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many notebooks Martha had before she bought more. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. So, if we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the total, we get:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we multiply Martha's original number of notebooks by 3:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

This means Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. We subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana. 

First, we need to find out how much more Anis rowed:
1/5 of 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to get the total distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance they rowed on that day is:
110 miles"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Yesterday's Reading:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Today's Reading:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
     - Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel didn't read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

3. **Total Pages Read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

4. **Difference in Pages Read:**
   - To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read.

1. The pot has enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. That means they will use 2 adult bowls.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is the same as 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are the same as 4 child bowls.
4. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After Calvin and his wife eat, there will be:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls left.
5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. So, the 4 child bowls left can be split between the two children:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much William spent on the notebooks. Each notebook costs $1.50, and he bought 5 notebooks. So, we multiply the cost of one notebook by the number of notebooks:

\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.50, and he bought 1 ballpen. So, we multiply the cost of one ballpen by the number of ballpens:

\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

8.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, she will need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, she will need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many times Deepa saw the movies in total. She saw each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies 3 times. So, we multiply 9 by 3:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 times

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find out how much she paid on average for each ticket, we divide the total amount she spent by the total number of times she saw the movies:

$216 / 27 times = $8 per ticket

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. 

5"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim starts with:
- Blue shoe boxes: 7
- Red shoe boxes: 9

Next, we need to figure out how many of each he uses for fishing:
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, we subtract the number of shoe boxes he uses from the total he started with:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

Finally, we add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes to get the total number left:
- Total shoe boxes left: 4 + 6 = 10

So, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
10"
"Okay, so Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, which means he had 18 books. But he lost 2 of them. So, if we take away 2 from 18, Joseph now has 16 books.

"Okay, so Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. That means Jamie gets 30 divided by 5, which is 6 marbles. Then, Dean gives 10 more marbles to Donald. So, Dean has given away 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald, which is a total of 16 marbles. If Dean started with 30 marbles and gave away 16, he has 30 - 16 = 14 marbles left.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Duncan is 60 years old now. 

First, let's figure out Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

So, Duncan was 52 years old eight years ago.

Next, we know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago \( A - 4 \), where \( A \) is Adam's current age.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

38"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we need to calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the sizes together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \]

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

700"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in one hour. The problem says he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we do:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in one hour. He gets paid $0.20 for each package. So, we multiply the number of packages by the pay per package:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]
Colby earns $8 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday. We multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]
Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

So, the final answer is:
64"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long it takes John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. We know that a normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4:

\[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:

\[ 180 \div 30 = 6 \]

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

So, 40 pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. This means the remaining pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yellow balloons there are. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times y \text{ yellow balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

To find \( y \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles each day for 30 days. So, we multiply 100 miles by 30 days:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times 1000 miles fits into 3000 miles, because the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. We divide 3000 miles by 1000 miles:
\[ 3000 \text{ miles} \div 1000 \text{ miles/tune-up} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice as long as he did on Tuesday. So, he works:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. So, he works:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up the hours he worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days. 

23"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Julia and Nadine spent in total. They bought a cake for $11, balloons for $0.5 for every 2 balloons, and 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: They bought 1 dozen (12) balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons would cost:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each:
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we have 6 students playing tennis. That's easy enough.

Next, the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of students playing tennis. So, we multiply 6 by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, for soccer, we have 16 boys and 22 girls. We add these together to get the total number of students playing soccer:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Finally, we add up all the students from each sport:
\[ 6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops the whole class sold. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they made from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. So, we multiply the number of lollipops by the price per lollipop:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it cost to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost $0.5. So, we multiply the number of lollipops by the cost per lollipop:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Okay, let's figure out how many pets Larry has step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ gerbils}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
3 \text{ cats} + 9 \text{ dogs} + 7 \text{ rabbits} + 21 \text{ fish} + 7 \text{ gerbils} = 47 \text{ pets}
\]

So, Larry has 47 pets in total."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.
3. Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.
4. The loaf has 24 slices in total.
5. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat each day: 24 / 6 = 4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Okay, so Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old, and she adds one shell to her collection every month. We need to figure out how many shells she will have by the time she turns 10.

First, let's find out how many years she has been collecting shells:
10 years old - 5 years old = 5 years

Next, we need to convert those years into months because she collects one shell each month:
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since she collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have by her 10th birthday is:
60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Lana has 27 cups in total. She uses 15 of these cups to make cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups left for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows. So, each row has:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours per trip:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip to get a total of 24 berries. Since he can make 2 trips, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of the water from the pool. So, the tank gets:

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:
   \[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]
4. To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount:
   \[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Money Given:**
   Colby gets $150 each month to spend at the movies.

2. **Movies Already Seen:**
   - 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: Each ticket costs $10.
     \[
     5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - 8 movies on other days: Each ticket costs $7.
     \[
     8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Snacks Already Bought:**
   - 2 tubs of popcorn: Each tub costs $8.
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - 4 boxes of candy: Each box costs $2.
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Spent So Far:**
   - Total for movies: $50 + $56 = $106
   - Total for snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
   - Total spent: $106 + $24 = $130

5. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Initial budget: $150
   - Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

6. **Cost for the Last Night:**
   - Movie ticket on Friday: $10
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Box of candy: $2
   - Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

7. **Can He Afford the Last Night?**
   - Yes, he can afford the last night because the remaining budget is exactly $20.

8. **Total Number of Movies:**
   - Movies already seen: 5 + 8 = 13
   - Additional movie on the last night: 1
   - Total movies: 13 + 1 = 14

So, Colby can see a total of 14 movies this month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - So, a mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \div 3 = 200 \) calories.

2. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - So, a mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \div 3 = 150 \) calories.

3. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

4. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

5. **Total calories from all pastries:**
   - Add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories = \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"Okay, let's figure out the average number of Junebugs Rita removes each day.

First, we need to add up all the Junebugs she removed from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 times Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add 39 and 78:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add 117 and 78:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add 195 and 48:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add 243 and 57:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went compared to the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

First, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

So, 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys:

62 - 48 = 14

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we would in a high school math class.

We know three things:
1. The total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is the sum of Paul’s and Jean’s ages.

Let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( L \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

From the information given:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, we can substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( J \):
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 \]
\[ L = 20 + 10 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
\[ P = L + J \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

\[
\boxed{50}

\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also already have 10 boxes, so we add those:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tables are needed to fit all 60 boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes, so:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already has 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Zoey and Sydney each spit their seeds in total.

Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances to find the combined total distance:
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people, which is 2:
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30
- Total widgets: \( 60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200 \)

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30
- Total widgets: \( 45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets.

Each widget sells for $6.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Total revenue: \( 43200 \times 6 = 259200 \)

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Total revenue: \( 32400 \times 6 = 194400 \)

### Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

Difference in revenue: \( 259200 - 194400 = 64800 \)

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

64800"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. After that, it's 70 pesos for each extra hour.

First, we need to find out how many extra hours Cameron stays:
17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours

Now, we calculate the cost for these extra hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

250"
"Okay, let's figure out how much hay Nate needs for his livestock.

First, we need to find out how much hay each type of animal needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount a goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds per sheep.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats:
- There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Total hay for goats: \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:
- There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay.
- Total hay for sheep: \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay Nate needs:
- Total hay: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. So, we subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. So, we subtract that amount as well:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, John can buy 4 pens.

4"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many letters Craig spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

So, Craig spelled out 300 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled out. The problem says that Craig's brother spelled out 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother spelled out 350 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[
\boxed{650}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that there are 8 children in each row. There are 7 rows for each school, and there are 5 different schools participating.

To find the total number of children, we need to multiply these numbers together:

1. Number of children in each row: 8
2. Number of rows per school: 7
3. Number of schools: 5

So, we calculate it like this:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} \]

First, multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows per school:

\[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \]

Next, multiply the result by the number of schools:

\[ 56 \times 5 = 280 \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

280"
"Okay, let's work this out step by step, like we did in high school math class.

First, we need to figure out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gets from the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon is worth 100 bottles of apple juice. So, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon is worth:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student gets:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles are left for the teacher:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

842"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges $40 just to come to the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: She charges $35 for each hour of work. The job took 2.25 hours, so we need to calculate the labor cost:
   \[ 2.25 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 78.75 \text{ dollars} \]
3. **Parts Charge**: The job also required $60 worth of parts.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars (visit)} + 78.75 \text{ dollars (labor)} + 60 \text{ dollars (parts)} = 178.75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Patty charged is:
\[ 178.75 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost without any discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, he gets a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount:
\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much he actually paid:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he gets $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the amount he paid:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:
50"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops.

First, we need to calculate how much she will earn from the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.5.
- So, the total from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.
- So, the total from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

Then, we calculate the earnings from the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- So, the total from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Finally, we add up all the earnings:
- Total earnings = $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **First, figure out how far James swims initially:**
   - The lake is 20 miles long.
   - James swims 60% of the lake.
   - So, \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Next, calculate how long it takes him to swim the first part:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Then, figure out how long he rests:**
   - He rests for half as long as he swam.
   - Rest time = \( 6 \) hours / 2 = 3 hours.

4. **Now, calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Determine his speed for the remaining distance:**
   - He swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( 2 \) miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Finally, add up all the times to get the total time:**
   - Initial swimming time = 6 hours
   - Rest time = 3 hours
   - Remaining swimming time = 8 hours
   - Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"Okay, so if Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, and the bakery has 40 less than seven times that amount, we first figure out what seven times 70 is. 

Seven times 70 is 490. 

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490 to find out how many loaves the bakery has. 

490 minus 40 is 450.

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, the commission for one copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, the commission for one copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
15.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can find Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from 26:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]
So, Marcus is 21 years old.

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. To find Leo’s age, we need to double Marcus's age:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're in high school.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's use some algebra to figure this out.

1. Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points.
2. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
3. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we can write the equation for the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Let's simplify this equation:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours in total.

Next, we need to convert these hours into minutes because we know how many reports Vince can staple in 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours is the same as 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Time Lost:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes
   - Total time lost = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes
   - Total time lost: 28 minutes
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups (since 1 dozen is 12).

So, the number of measuring spoons is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left. This includes the 24 measuring cups and the 10 measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the hospital has 1000 beds in total. Right now, 1/5 of these beds are occupied. To find out how many beds are occupied, we do:

\[ 1000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 200 \]

So, 200 beds are occupied at the start.

Next, 50 new patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the number of new patients admitted is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

So, 700 new patients are admitted over 2 weeks.

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of new patients admitted to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total number of beds in the hospital:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 100."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. So, the number of non-work emails is:

4. Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

5. This means 6 emails are sent to family. So, the remaining emails are:
   \[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

6. One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can find out how old Shawna's father is:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there actually were. 

To find out how many people really attended, we need to figure out what 100% (the actual number) would be if 48 is 120% (100% + 20%).

First, let's set up the equation:
\[ 48 = 1.2 \times \text{actual number} \]

Now, to find the actual number, we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ \text{actual number} = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Let's do the math:
\[ \text{actual number} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many holes the pirates dug each day and the total by the end of each day.

- **First day:** They dug 10 holes.
- **Second day:** They dug 13 holes.
- **Third day:** They dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's add up the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes} \]

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug on the first day. Since they dug 10 holes on the first day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

So, by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"Okay, so let's think this through. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. That means together they got 70 + 70, which is 140 corn chips. Now, the problem says that the third person, Collins, got 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. So, Collins got 70 + 15, which is 85 corn chips. 

To find out how many corn chips there were altogether, we add up what each person got: 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"Okay, so Jen needs to travel to 3 different countries and has to pay $400 for all the supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much the travel costs, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and then add that to the original $400.

First, 50% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

Now, add that to the original $400:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600.

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person has caught:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
Substitute \( A = 40 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the entire show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to find out how far the bird traveled from her summer home to her winter home.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 10 hours × 30 miles/hour = 300 miles.

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 2 hours × 18 miles/hour = 36 miles.

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 5 hours × 22 miles/hour = 110 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances the bird flew south and subtract the distance she flew north to find the total distance between her summer and winter homes.

- Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.
- Distance north = 36 miles.

Net distance south = Total distance south - Distance north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen is 12, she made:
   \[ 12 \text{ brownies} \]

2. At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Half a dozen is 6, so she got:
   \[ 6 \text{ brownies} \]

3. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. Four dozen is 48, so they had:
   \[ 48 \text{ brownies} \]

4. Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:
   \[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

5. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. One and a half dozen is 18, so:
   \[ 18 \text{ brownies were eaten} \]

6. To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had:
   \[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day. 

48"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that means his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find out how much younger, we calculate 25% of 8, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet:

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Andy has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut.
   - It takes him 15 minutes to string each one.
   - So, the total time for synthetic gut is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Andy has 5 racquets to string with polyester string.
   - It takes him 22 minutes to string each one.
   - So, the total time for polyester string is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Andy has 4 racquets to string with a hybrid set.
   - It takes him 18 minutes to string each one.
   - So, the total time for hybrid sets is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times to get the total time Andy will spend stringing all the racquets:
\[ 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \] minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

227"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

John is buying phones for himself, his wife, and his two kids. That's a total of 4 phones. Each phone costs $600, but after the first two, the price is cut in half.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

1800"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we need to add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find the total number of players on both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33. 

33"
"To figure out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to find the total length of the fence he's building. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

So, the perimeter is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats he needs is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

100"
"Okay, let's work through this step by step.

First, Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges, so she had:
\[ 12 \times 20 = 240 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

So, the number of boxes she has left is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, she kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes. So, she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she sold the rest of the boxes:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many states are in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Next, we need to find out how many states India has. The problem says that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we first find half of 50, which is 25. Then we add 4 to 25, which gives us 29. So, India has 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries together:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

79"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the books Tyler wants to buy:
- The dictionary costs $18.
- The dinosaur book costs $13.
- The children's cookbook costs $8.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to figure out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

5"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. The problem also says that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, if Robert has 30 cherries, Richard must have:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. If Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries, then the number of cherries Jerry has is:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

20"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Sunny earned over the two days.

First, let's break down the sales for each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's add up the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of:

465"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Sunscreen Usage per Day:**
   - Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours each day.
   - So, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

2. **Total Sunscreen Usage for the Vacation:**
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - So, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

3. **Number of Bottles Needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: \(32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Okay, so if the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper, that means the red car costs 60% of what the blue car costs. 

To find 60% of $100:
60% of $100 = 0.60 * $100 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

So, both cars together cost $160. 

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Emil's Current Age:**
   - Emil is 19 years old now.

2. **Emil's Age in 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

3. **Dad's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

4. **Dad's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

5. **Brother's Age in 5 Years:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

6. **Brother's Current Age:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

7. **Sum of Dad's and Brother's Current Ages:**
   - Dad's current age is 43.
   - Brother's current age is 7.
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

90"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 4 times what he caught on Thursday. So, he caught:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   Joe caught half of what he caught on Friday. So, he caught:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total Catch:**
   Now, we add up the amounts from all three days:
   \[
   3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Number of Servings:**
   Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total catch by 3:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
   \]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many football players there are in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the 30 students are football players:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Now, out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So we calculate:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

So, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

12"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Sophie's boot size is 5.
2. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots. So, Charlie's boot size is:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]
3. To find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie, we add their boot sizes and divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

So, the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Pat will spend to fill her flower bed.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will take up 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Okay, so if Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats half of that. Half of 18 is 9 pretzels a day for his brother. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply 9 by 7, because there are 7 days in a week. 

So, 9 pretzels/day × 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one basket. 

- Each petunia costs $3.00, and Katherine wants 3 petunias in each basket. So, the cost for the petunias in one basket is:
  \[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. So, the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
  \[ 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00 \]

Now, we add the costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines to get the total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, so we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, so let's break this down step by step. Jessica makes $2,000 a month. She saves 25% of that for fancy shoes. 

First, we need to find out how much 25% of $2,000 is:
25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

So, she saves $500 each month for shoes. Now, we need to figure out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
$500 * 12 = $6,000

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes:
$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp in one minute. So, to find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals she needs to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:

\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]

Since each interval is 10 minutes, the total cooking time is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **First, the air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours:**
   - On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Next, the air conditioner runs on high for 4 hours:**
   - On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Then, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:**
   - When the air conditioner is off, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- The room cooled by 6 degrees on low.
- The room cooled by 12 degrees on high.
- The room warmed up by 4 degrees when the air conditioner was off.

So, the total change in temperature is:
- \(6 + 12 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.**
   - This means the comet was visible when Bill's dad was 30.

2. **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it.**
   - So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.**
   - This means the comet appears every 75 years.

4. **To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw it the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes 1 check every month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford also writes 1 check every month for the gas bill. So, for the gas bill, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes 2 checks every month to the church. So, for the church, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The first plane makes a bunch of trips, and 3/4 of those trips are to Greece.
2. The remaining 1/4 of the trips are split equally between France and Germany. So, 1/8 of the total trips go to France, and 1/8 go to Germany.
3. The second plane only goes to Poland and makes 44 trips. These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane must make twice as many trips as the second plane.

Let's figure out how many trips the first plane makes:
- If 44 trips are half of the first plane's trips, then the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in total.

Now, we need to find out how many of those 88 trips are to France:
- Since 1/8 of the trips go to France, we calculate \( \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \).

So, the first plane makes 11 trips to France in one day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - So, Chikote howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - So, Igneous howls for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Time:**
   - Add up the howl times of all three wolves.
   - Total howl time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, 120 seconds = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

Adam bought new trousers for $30. His mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him twice as much as his mom. So, his dad gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money from his mom and dad:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, Adam got $18 from his parents. The trousers cost $30, so the amount Adam had to pay from his own savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

12"
"Okay, let's figure out Wilfred's age step by step.

First, we know the total age of all four children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.

So, the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

This means the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene's age is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know Helene is 10 years old. Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from 13:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"Okay, so Walter is collecting money for charity. He first gets $500 from his neighbors and then $1500 from an online fund. That's a total of $500 + $1500, which is $2000. Then, his friend gives him an extra $200. So now, the total amount collected is $2000 + $200, which is $2200.

Walter's lawyer says he will donate three times the amount that everyone else has donated. So, the lawyer will donate 3 times $2200, which is $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many cookies were at the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, we multiply 100 by 15:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride gave half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we know that each person at the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were at the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people at the church is:

50"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon needs to be divided such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

1. Let's say each kid's slice is \( x \) (some amount of the watermelon).
2. Then, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \) (twice the amount of a kid's slice).

Now, let's figure out the total amount of the watermelon:

- There are 4 kids, so the total amount of watermelon for the kids is \( 4x \).
- There are 2 adults, so the total amount of watermelon for the adults is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

Adding these together, the total amount of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

So, the whole watermelon is \( 8x \).

Now, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon.

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Amount each adult gets}}{\text{Total amount of watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

25%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Time for Rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time for Appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - Total time for rounds and appointments = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time Left for Updating Records:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours available.
   - Time left = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records. 

1 hour"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jordan needs to make a cake for her mom's birthday. Here's what she needs to do and how long each step takes:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the time needed:
20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes to hours:
180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find out the latest time she can start, we need to subtract the total time (3 hours) from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \]

So, they sold a total of 8 boxes of chocolate bars.

Next, we know that these 8 boxes contain 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to run the dance studio for one session. The studio costs $25 to rent for each session, and it costs $1.50 per student per session. Since there are 10 students, the cost for the students is:

\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost for one session is:

\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to run the studio for one week. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly cost is:

\[ 3 \text{ sessions per week} \times \$40 \text{ per session} = \$120 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to run the studio for one month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the monthly cost is:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks per month} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

So, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:

480"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we do the same for Martha. Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of her boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. The problem says that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. The total population is 50, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Now, we need to find out how many babies are born in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the total population after a year:

\[ \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

\[ \boxed{1490} \]"
"To figure out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to do a few calculations. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular shape, so we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

So, it will cost $826 to fill the pool."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. So, we add 5 to the number of red sticks:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]
So, there are 14 blue sticks.

Then, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]
So, there are 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we add up all the sticks:
\[ 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is 34."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Matteo traveled. Matteo was driving at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Shandy traveled. Shandy was driving at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove compared to Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to find out how many female students are at Brook Hills High School.

1. **Total number of students**: The school has 3000 students.

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - So, the number of students over 16 is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

3. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - So, the number of male students over 16 is \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \).

4. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 are female.
   - So, the number of female students over 16 is \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \).

5. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The other half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - So, the number of students under 16 is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students under 16 are male.
   - So, the number of male students under 16 is \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \).

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students under 16 are female.
   - So, the number of female students under 16 is \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \).

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Add the number of female students over 16 and under 16.
   - So, the total number of female students is \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \).

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so he can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.

Bethany runs 10 laps, and Quinn runs 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to figure out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank each day.

### Day 1:
- **Wanda's Contribution:**
  - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
  - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
  - So, Wanda pumped:
    \[
    \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
    \]

- **Ms. B's Contribution:**
  - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
  - So, Ms. B pumped:
    \[
    \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
    \]

- **Total for Day 1:**
  - Total water pumped on the first day:
    \[
    4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
    \]

### Day 2:
- **Wanda's Contribution:**
  - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  - So, Wanda pumped:
    \[
    \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
    \]

- **Ms. B's Contribution:**
  - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  - So, Ms. B pumped:
    \[
    \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
    \]

- **Total for Day 2:**
  - Total water pumped on the second day:
    \[
    3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
    \]

### Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:
- Total water pumped over both days:
  \[
  7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:
- The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons.
- The amount of water already in the tank is 12,000 gallons.
- So, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:
  \[
  18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's work through this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Final Charge:**
   - We know that at the end, the power bank has 28% charge left.

2. **Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Let's call the charge at the start of these 3 hours \( x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):
     \[
     (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was about 34.8%.

3. **First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Let's call the charge at the start of these 5 hours \( y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8%, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):
     \[
     (0.91)^5 \approx 0.59049
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
     \]
   - So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was about 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment on the car. The car costs $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 10,000 = 0.20 \times 10,000 = 2,000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total earnings per hour are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

If she works 40 hours a week, her total earnings per week are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Janet to save $2,000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2,000}{1,000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. Here are the prices of the fruits:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already bought:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate how much he has spent so far:
- 3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums he can buy by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Each of these 13 packs has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave away is:

13 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

She gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally, so each friend received:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

"Okay, let's figure out the price of carrots after three years with a 5% increase each year.

First, we start with the initial price of carrots, which is $120.

Each year, the price increases by 5%. So, we need to calculate the new price for each year.

1. **After the first year:**
   \[
   120 \times 1.05 = 126

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put them into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   72 \div 8 = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
   \]

2. Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums are selfies and 2 albums are portraits. We need to find out how many pictures are in the selfie albums and how many are in the portrait albums:
   - For selfies: 
     \[
     3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
     \]
   - For portraits:
     \[
     2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
     \]

3. To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and the number of portraits:
   \[
   27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures}
   \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. So, to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 18 \times 10 \]
\[ 3x = 180 \]
\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests check out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. This means she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The total money she made from selling the stuffed animals is $120. We can set up an equation to represent this:

\[ 4 \times (2x) + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many sandwiches each person eats in a day:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches.

Now, let's add these up to find out how many sandwiches the whole family eats in one day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

77"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, I'll calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling the cookies and cupcakes.

- She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so that's 80 * 1 = $80.
- She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so that's 60 * 4 = $240.

Now, I'll add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:

- Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320.

Next, I need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters for helping her:

- She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so that's 2 * 10 = $20.

Finally, I'll subtract the $20 from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:

- Money left = $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs in total.
2. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. So, together they found:
   \[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]
3. There were 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.
4. To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs:
   \[ 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

30"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is \(24 \times 0.5 = 12\) pounds. Adding this to the 24 pounds, he can mine \(24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Next, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
\[40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}\]

Finally, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:
\[1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:
43200"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have three different packages of sandwiches:

1. 2 sandwiches for $3
2. 4 sandwiches for $6
3. 8 sandwiches, but we don't know the price yet

First, let's find out how much each sandwich costs in the first two packages:

- For the first package: 2 sandwiches for $3 means each sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
- For the second package: 4 sandwiches for $6 means each sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, each sandwich in the third package should also cost $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches:
- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.
2. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000.
3. He uses the $1000 to pay part of the new bedroom set, so:
   \[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]
   Now, Tom owes $2000.
4. He has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find 10% of $2000:
   \[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Sally starts with:
- 25 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 12 yellow balloons

Then, a gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst. To find out how many red balloons burst:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \] red balloons.

Next, Sally is startled and releases half of the yellow balloons. To find out how many yellow balloons she releases:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, she releases 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \] yellow balloons.

As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find out how many blue balloons she adds:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons:
\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

So, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step to figure out the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework.

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in (which is the other 50% chance), there are two more scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension.
       - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
     - **Personal extension:**
       - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension to the whole class (which is a 60% chance), there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension.
       - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, let's add up all the probabilities where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Extension for the whole class: 20%
- Personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many seats are left for the friends and family after accounting for the seats for the graduates and the faculty.

The total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center is 6000. We need to subtract the seats for the graduates and the faculty:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats available for friends and family.

Next, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat:
   \[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if he can eat 150 medium-sized beans, the number of small beans he can eat is:
   \[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in high school math class.

First, we need to find out how many hours Melissa spent on jury duty. She spent 6 hours a day for 3 days. So, we multiply 6 hours by 3 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how much Melissa earned from the jury duty. She gets paid $15 per day for 3 days. So, we multiply $15 by 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to figure out her total expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days. So, we multiply $3 by 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} \div 18 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Ted buys 3 books. Each book costs $16. So, the total cost for the books is:
3 books * $16/book = $48

Next, Ted buys 3 pencils. Each pencil costs $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
3 pencils * $6/pencil = $18

Now, to find out how much Ted spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
$48 + $18 = $66

So, Ted spent a total of $66.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Find out how many soda bottles Richard will use:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - So, the number of bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \).

2. **Calculate the time it takes to move between the bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - He has to move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - So, the total time to move between the bottles is \( 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \).

3. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he doesn't need extra time to get to it.
   - So, the time to drop the candy in the first bottle is 0 seconds.

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

35 seconds"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples, and each box has forty apples. That means he has a total of 40 apples times 2, which is 80 apples. He wants to pack these apples into packs with 8 apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack. So, 80 apples divided by 8 apples per pack equals 10 packs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Amor spends on the Parmesan cheese. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds. So, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11 \text{ per pound} = \$22 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends on the Mozzarella cheese. The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds. So, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, Amor will have \$10 left to buy meat.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans each year.
   - So, the total loans he gets are: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the income Jim lost while in school:**
   - Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years while in college.
   - So, the total income he lost is: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income:**
   - Total cost of college (loans) + Total income lost = \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - So, his new income is: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take Jim to earn the total amount:**
   - He needs to earn \( 300,000 \) dollars.
   - He earns \( 75,000 \) dollars per year.
   - So, the time it will take is: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. First, we need to find one-fifth of Monday's letters:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]
Then, we add 17 to this:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we need to find twice Tuesday's letters:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then, we add 5 to this:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is 10 * $6.50 = $65.00.

Next, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.00.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is 6 * $6.00 = $36.00.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

1. **First Race:**
   - He lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Next, we need to find the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day.

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people live in all these cities combined. We know that each city has 1000 people. So, we multiply the number of cities by the population of each city:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population in South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. Xavier was 4 feet tall, and since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 by 12:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we add the 3 inches Xavier grew over the summer to his initial height:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Now, let's look at Cole. Cole was already 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights now, we subtract Xavier's new height from Cole's new height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets \( x \).

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person gets \( x + 80 \).

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person gets \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person's share is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in high school math class.

First, we need to know how many days the painters worked. They worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know they worked for 3/8 of a day each day. To find out how many hours they worked each day, we need to convert 3/8 of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours the team worked in total over the 21 days:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. There are 4 painters, so we divide the total hours by 4:
\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours/painter} \]

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls over three sets. We need to find out how many he got in the first set.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he got \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he got \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:

\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find out how many he got in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The car loses value at a rate of 21% each year. We need to find out how much the car is worth in 2010, which is 3 years later.

First, we need to understand that each year, the car is worth 79% of its value from the previous year (because it loses 21%, so 100% - 21% = 79%).

Let's calculate the value of the car year by year:

1. **2008:**
   \[
   20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]
   So, in 2008, the car is worth $15,800.

2. **2009:**
   \[
   15800 \times 0.79 = 12482
   \]
   So, in 2009, the car is worth $12,482.

3. **2010:**
   \[
   12482 \times 0.79 = 9860.78
   \]
   So, in 2010, the car is worth $9,860.78.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 50 books in total.

Half of these books are in English, so:
50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

Next, 10% of the books are in German, so:
10% of 50 = 0.10 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how much water she drinks in 30 days and then convert that into gallons.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we did in math class.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:** 120
2. **First stop:** 20 more people get on the train.
   - New total: 120 + 20 = 140
3. **Second stop:** 50 people get off, and twice that number (100 people) get on.
   - People getting off: 140 - 50 = 90
   - People getting on: 90 + 100 = 190
4. **Third stop:** 80 people get off.
   - New total: 190 - 80 = 110

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
110"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear.

1. **Tank top**: She bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so that's $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so that's $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on her athletic gear."
"To figure out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, I need to do a few calculations.

First, I need to know how many tiles I'll need. Since each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, each tile covers 1 square foot. My kitchen floor is 200 square feet, so I'll need 200 tiles.

Next, I need to find out how much 200 tiles will cost. Each tile costs $12, so I multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it will cost me $2400 to renovate my kitchen floor.

2400"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month.
2. After the accident, the cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

First, we need to find out what 60% of $120 is:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increase in cost is $72.

Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

2304"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Greg has to put clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

First, let's figure out how many loads he does each week:

1. For the twin beds:
   - He has 4 twin beds.
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
   - So, he needs to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

2. For the king size bed:
   - He has 1 king size bed.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time.
   - So, he needs to do 1 load for the king size bed.

Now, let's add up the loads for one week:
- 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king size bed = 3 loads per week.

Next, we need to find out how many loads he does in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads per year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Movies on Saturday:**
   - Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday.
   - Half of 4 movies is 2 movies.

3. **Total movies per weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies in 4 weeks:**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

So, in 4 weeks, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies.

24"
"Okay, let's figure out how many stickers Leo has in his collection.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he added 50 more stickers to his collection.
This year, he collected twice as many stickers as he did last year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year.

Now, let's add them all up:
100 (from two years ago) + 50 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much food all the cats eat in one feeding. Since Imma has 3 cats and each cat eats 60 grams of food per feeding, we multiply 60 grams by 3 cats:

60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams per feeding

Next, since the cats are fed twice a day, we need to find out how much food they eat in one day. We multiply the amount of food per feeding by the number of feedings per day:

180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food consumed per day:

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days. 

2 days"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. The problem also tells us that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, if Becky ate 10 slices, then Jake must have eaten:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:
31"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say Donovan took \( D \) minutes to make his part of the meal. Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so Betsy took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both of them to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( D \). Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer, we add 18 to 40:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

58"
"Okay, let's break down the costs for Hannah's doctor's visit step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300 per hour, so for 30 minutes, it would be:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4. So, the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the cost is $6 per hour. So, the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
482"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we need to find out how many emails do need a response.

First, let's find 20% of 80:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means the rest of the emails do need a response. To find out how many emails need a response, we subtract the 16 emails from the total 80 emails:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center. 

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so that's \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so that's \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add all these up to find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. John took four tests. He got 100 on the first three tests and 80 on the fourth test. To find his average score, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

95"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. That means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of these pizzas, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
pizzas were eaten. That means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Now, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left by the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons. So, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost, we add the costs of the small and big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends a total of:
\[ 245 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. That means Sidney ordered:
10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches. So, Sidney had:
7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left

Sidney then ordered another 3 sandwiches, so now Sidney has:
3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 sandwiches is:
6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks to deliver fertiliser.
2. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
3. Two hours after they left, 1/4 of the trucks had mechanical issues and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

First, we need to find out how many trucks had mechanical issues:
- 1/4 of 20 trucks = 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks couldn't deliver the fertiliser. This means the remaining trucks that did deliver the fertiliser are:
- 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by these 15 trucks:
- Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser.
- 15 trucks \* 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

300"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, the grocery store has a promotion: ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter you buy at full price, the next pound is half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Let's break down the cost for 6 pounds:

1. First pound: $4.00
2. Second pound: $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00
3. Third pound: $4.00
4. Fourth pound: $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00
5. Fifth pound: $4.00
6. Sixth pound: $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the costs:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00 \]

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{18.00} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people Kayla invited in total:
- She invited 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of people she invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so the number of people who will actually attend is:
45 - 4 = 41

The theater charges $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest, they charge $6. Since 41 people are coming, we need to find out how many additional guests there are:
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for these 21 additional guests is:
21 * 6 = 126

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests:
125 + 126 = 251

So, the total cost for the party is:
251"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie spent $15 and has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it. One-third of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza spent $20 and has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining amounts:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left together.

85"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total bananas for the week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **Daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - So, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - The first and second monkeys together eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

5. **Total consumption of the third monkey for the week:**
   - The total number of bananas is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas: \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

6. **Daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats \(147 \div 7 = 21\) bananas each day.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Okay, so Teddy did half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he did 250 pieces. Then, he did a whole other 500 piece puzzle. So, if you add those together:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

So, Teddy placed 750 pieces during that hour."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Jenny spent on the roses. She bought 15 roses. The florist sells roses for $2 each or $15 for a dozen (12 roses).

- For 12 roses, she pays $15.
- For the remaining 3 roses, she pays \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills, which means she had \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much change she gets back. The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the 4 dollars into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars} \times \frac{4 \text{ quarters}}{1 \text{ dollar}} = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

16"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, for the milkshakes:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
- So, the total from milkshakes is 6 * 5.50 = $33.00.

Next, for the burger platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
- So, the total from burger platters is 9 * 11 = $99.00.

Finally, for the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
- So, the total from sodas is 20 * 1.50 = $30.00.

Now, let's add up all the totals:
- Total money made = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.

So, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"Okay, let's figure out how long Paul has to wait for his train. We need to break it down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, it leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

145"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week, and she's been doing this for 12 weeks. So, we multiply 10 by 12:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has from the total she needs:
\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to figure out how many more weeks it will take her to save 80 more toothpicks. We divide 80 by 10:
\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is \( 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \) dollars.

2. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers sold it for is \( 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800.
   - The discount is \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) dollars.

4. **Find the percentage discount:**
   - The percentage discount is \( \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \).

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

10%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. We know that:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds

So, 4 hours would be:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 14400 seconds

Next, if one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:
14400 jellyfish

Since we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by all 5 springs in 4 hours would be:
5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

72000"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

James is walking to a store that is 4 miles away from his home. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
   - Time taken to walk 2 miles: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Return Home:**
   - James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, another 2 miles.
   - Time taken to walk back home:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - James then walks the full 4 miles to the store.
   - Time taken to walk 4 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time taken is the sum of the times for each leg of the journey:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny got in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate how much it cost Jenny to buy the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence in total. We also know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's call the amount of fence Sam gets \( S \).

Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, the amount of fence Harry gets can be written as \( S + 60 \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of fence:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( S \). Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find out how much it grows in one year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years. That gives us:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, if the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, we can find out how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying 2 inches by 13 years:

\[ 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to figure out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes
   - \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
3. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes
   - \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
4. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes
   - Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

Next, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Price of each type of bike**:
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: Half the price of an MTB
     - \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Trekking: $450

2. **Earnings from each type of bike**:
   - Earnings from MTB:
     - \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
   - Earnings from BMX:
     - \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
   - Earnings from Trekking:
     - \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

Finally, we add up all the earnings to find the total.

- Total earnings:
  - \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

131250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour. So, in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, we need to know how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour. So, in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many classes John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day, plus 2 extra classes, so that's 8 classes a day. Since he goes to school 5 days a week, we multiply:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ classes/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, John spends an additional 1/16 of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday. First, we calculate 1/16 of 1600 minutes:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the regular class time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

30"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how high the ball is dropped from. Since each story in the mall is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, the total height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce. The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height. So, after the first bounce, the height is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the second bounce. Again, it bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce. So, after the second bounce, the height is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Okay, so if the orchard sells apples in bags of 10 and they sold a total of 2000 apples, we first need to figure out how many bags that is. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:

2000 apples ÷ 10 apples/bag = 200 bags

Next, we need to find out how much money the orchard made. Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags × $5/bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 from selling the apples.

1000"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the other half was left.
2. Then, the velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. So, they ate half of the half that was left, which means they ate a quarter of the triceratops.
3. After the velociraptors, there was only a quarter of the triceratops left. The Allosaurus ate all of this, which was 270 kilograms.

So, if 270 kilograms is a quarter of the triceratops, we can find the total weight by multiplying 270 by 4.

\[ 270 \times 4 = 1080 \]

Therefore, the triceratops weighed 1080 kilograms before the T-Rex ate it.

1080"
"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to paint the room.

First, we need to find out the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.

Let's calculate the area of each pair of walls:

1. **North and South Walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **East and West Walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint are required. One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet:
- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12:
- Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

So, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

144"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen has a case of 12 sodas.
   - 3 of these sodas are shaken.
   - 9 of these sodas are unshaken.

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Now, there are 11 sodas left.
   - 3 of these are still shaken.
   - 8 of these are unshaken.

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas left.
   - 2 of these are shaken.
   - 6 of these are unshaken.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - We need to find the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda.
   - There are 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas.
   - The probability is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

25%"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have two trains leaving from the same station, but they're going in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

First, let's figure out how far each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train, going 60 miles per hour, will travel \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles in 3 hours.
- The second train, going 30 miles per hour, will travel \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles in 3 hours.

Since they are going in opposite directions, to find out how far apart they are, we add the distances they've each traveled:
- \(180 + 90 = 270\) miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

270"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to know how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is:

31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days that is, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. That means he works the rest of the days:

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Now, Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. So, the number of people he helps each day is:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Finally, to find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of people he helps each day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, Billy helps 240 people in total.

240"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people the buses could carry. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, we multiply 12 by 35:
12 * 35 = 420 people

Next, we need to find out how many people the cars could carry. There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, we multiply 20 by 3:
20 * 3 = 60 people

Now, we add the number of people the buses could carry to the number of people the cars could carry to get the total number of people:
420 + 60 = 480 people

So, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

480"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest one, we need to do a bit of math.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute.
- To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute.
- To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
- Time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes
- Time for the second biggest slide: 3 minutes
- Difference in time: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes two 15-minute breaks, which add up to 30 minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days.

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Amber ran 8 miles. 

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, we multiply 8 miles by 3.5:
\[ 8 \times 3.5 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles that Amber and Micah ran together:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:
\[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

113.00"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. So if the total number of jellyfish is \( T \), then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Next, we're told that a third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue when the UV light is on. So the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{T}{5} \), which is \( \frac{T}{15} \).

We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we can solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

90"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Figure out how much Lauren needs each year for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \).

4. **Find out how many years it will take to save $800,000:**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. To find out how long each of these parts will be, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm} \]

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

Next, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

5 cm"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can figure out the total number of students in the school. 

First, let's find out what 1% of the school population is. If 40% equals 240 boys, then 1% would be:
\[ \frac{240}{40} = 6 \]

Now, to find the total number of students (100%), we multiply 1% by 100:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. 

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find the total height of all the heels. There are three women wearing 4-inch heels, so that's:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Then, there are three women wearing 2-inch heels, so that's:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add these two totals together to get the total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the average height. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to hike twice a day, and each hike is 125 miles.

First, let's find out how many miles she will hike each day:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many miles she will hike in the entire month of June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is 9,300 miles, so we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles each day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the store will make from selling all the red balls. There are 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, we multiply 3 by 9:
\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
So, the store will make $27 from the red balls.

Next, we calculate the money from the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, we multiply 11 by 5:
\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \]
So, the store will make $55 from the blue balls.

Finally, we calculate the money from the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, we multiply 25 by 3:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]
So, the store will make $75 from the green balls.

Now, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of the 12 kg of apples Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples:
\[

\]

Paul wants a third of the apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add up what Pierre and Paul are taking:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total amount of apples left for Jacques is:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"Okay, so Anna had $16 to spend on books for the library. She already spent $4, and now she has $2 left. That means she spent $14 in total because $16 - $2 = $14. Out of that $14, $4 was already spent, so the two books she bought today cost $14 - $4 = $10. Since the two books cost the same, each book must have cost $10 / 2 = $5.

So, each book cost $5."
"Okay, so last year, 50 students were in the calligraphy class. This year, the number of students went up by 20%. To find out how many more students that is, you take 50 and multiply it by 20%, which is the same as 0.20. So, 50 times 0.20 equals 10. That means 10 more students joined the class this year. Now, to find the total number of students this year, you add the 10 new students to the 50 from last year. So, 50 plus 10 equals 60. 

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many times the lighthouse blinks in one minute. We know it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, we divide 255 by 5 to find the number of blinks per minute:

\[ \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we want to know how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can find this by dividing the total number of blinks we want (459) by the number of blinks per minute (51):

\[ \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to count the initial number of male and female fish in Tate's pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfish: 3
- Female goldfish: 5

Next, we add the fish that Tate buys:

- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfish: 2
- Additional female goldfish: 3

Now, let's add these to the initial counts:

- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's sum up the total number of male and female fish:

- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fish:

- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - So, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - So, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the times:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how far John drives one way to visit his parents. We know that he drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for one way:

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out the total distance for a round trip. Since he drives 140 miles one way, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to find out the total distance he drives in a month. For two visits:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

560"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. So, the total distance she will walk is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, then Brian will walk half of that distance:
\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we need to know how many toys the first four workers made. We have two workers who each make 6 toys an hour, and they work for 10 hours. So, for these two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

Next, we have two more workers who each make 4 toys an hour, and they also work for 10 hours. So, for these two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, let's add the toys made by all four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total, but by the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys. This means they have already made:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made the difference:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so to find out how many toys they made per hour, we divide the total number of toys they made by the number of hours they worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

Elijah has two dogs:
1. One dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
2. Another dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.

First, let's find the weight of Elijah's first dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's find the weight of Elijah's second dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're working through a math problem in high school.

1. Let's say Seth had \( S \) stickers at the beginning.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he got, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The rest of the stickers Luis had, he gave to Kris. So, Kris got \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had a total of \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. To find \( S \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many M&M's John has in total. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and he buys 3 large bags. So, the total weight of M&M's is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's. So, the total number of M&M's is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how far Alfie needs to fly to cover half the distance around the Earth. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5:
   \[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply 600 by 1.25:
   \[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam’s age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Let's set up the equations:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - So, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \)
   - Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \)

5. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

6. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - So, \( 2A \) is the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline.

7. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - So, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

8. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 56 - 30 \)
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - Divide by 2: \( A = 13 \)

9. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons.
   - Each group has 8 crayons.
   - Number of groups = 200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons/group = 25 groups.

2. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Each group of 8 crayons goes into one box.
   - So, Nik needs 25 boxes.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Total weight of crayons = 200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

5. **Find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   - Total weight = 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - Total weight in pounds = 400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, John cuts down an 80-foot tree, but he can only use 80% of it for logs. So, we need to find out how much of the tree he can actually use:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, he cuts the usable part of the tree into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he can get, we divide the usable length by 4:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we need to find out how many planks he gets in total:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as she does, so:
\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we add Valerie's and her brother's earnings to find their combined salary:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up all their earnings to find the total amount of money they have together:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a problem in high school math class.

First, we know that Grandma walks 3 miles every day. This includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

1. **Find Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Find Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

Now, Jane wants to save a total of $60. We need to find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to figure out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28. We do this by dividing:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has right now. The problem says that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob has} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the number of marbles Bob has, we subtract 24 from 60:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob has} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob has} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Next, the problem asks how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We subtract 10 from 36:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is at an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce from the other mug, and the resulting mixture is drinkable, meaning it's at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to use the formula for mixing temperatures:

\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(\text{Volume of Water 1} \times \text{Temperature of Water 1}) + (\text{Volume of Water 2} \times \text{Temperature of Water 2})}{\text{Total Volume of Water}} \]

Let's plug in the values we know:
- Volume of Water 1 (33 degrees) = 4 ounces
- Volume of Water 2 (unknown temperature) = 1 ounce
- Total Volume of Water = 4 + 1 = 5 ounces
- Final Temperature = 40 degrees (since it's drinkable)

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 40 = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:
\[ 40 = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 40 \times 5 = 132 + T_2 \]
\[ 200 = 132 + T_2 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ 200 - 132 = T_2 \]
\[ 68 = T_2 \]

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

First, we need to know how many cows and chickens Melanie's father starts with:
- He starts with 50 cows.
- He also starts with 20 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate how many cows and chickens are added each day:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days this goes on:
- The companies bring animals for three weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Let's calculate the total number of cows added over 21 days:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Now, let's calculate the total number of chickens added over 21 days:
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number added:
- Total cows: 50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows
- Total chickens: 20 initial chickens + 210 added chickens = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."

First, we need to find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost without any discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is buying 4 packs, so:
\[ 4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To find 10% of $40.00, we do:
\[ 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price:
\[ 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \]

Russell is buying 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted price by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per bagel is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's break that down:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day, so:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, for the following 30 days, Chester increases his egg intake to 5 eggs a day, so:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

First, we know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of people on the bus is 84.

To find out how many men and women there are, we need to add the parts of the ratio together:
5 (men) + 9 (women) = 14 parts

Now, we can find out how many people each part represents:
84 people / 14 parts = 6 people per part

So, the number of men is:
5 parts * 6 people per part = 30 men

And the number of women is:
9 parts * 6 people per part = 54 women

Next, we need to find out how many women are left on the bus after 20 women get off:
54 women - 20 women = 34 women

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:
34"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many individual sunflowers Faraday sells each day. He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2. So, we divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]
So, Faraday sells 13 individual sunflowers each day.

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets he sells each day. He earns $56 from selling bouquets, and each bouquet costs $8. So, we divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]
So, Faraday sells 7 bouquets each day.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets he sells each day is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \]
So, Faraday sells 84 sunflowers in bouquets each day.

Now, we add the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold each day:
\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]
So, Faraday sells 97 sunflowers each day.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, Faraday sells 291 sunflowers after 3 days.

291"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Adam has $100 to spend on rocks. Each rock costs $5.
   - So, he can buy \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \) rocks.

2. Adam sells each rock for $7.
   - But he only sells 60% of his inventory.
   - 60% of 20 rocks is \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) rocks.

3. The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
   - \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \) dollars.

4. The total cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:
   - \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) dollars.

5. To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:
   - \( 100 - 84 = 16 \) dollars.

So, Adam loses $16.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many days Lauren will need to draw all the large-sized picture scenes. She can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day, and she needs to draw 45 of them. So, we divide 45 by 5:

\[ 45 \div 5 = 9 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days she will need to draw all the medium-sized picture scenes. She can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day, and she needs to draw 36 of them. So, we divide 36 by 6:

\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many days she will need to draw all the small-sized picture scenes. She can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day, and she needs to draw 49 of them. So, we divide 49 by 7:

\[ 49 \div 7 = 7 \text{ days} \]

Now, we add up all the days:

\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to complete the project. 

22"
"Okay, so Chatty has three dozen eggs. That means she has 36 eggs because one dozen is 12 eggs. She wants to share these eggs equally among her four children. To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

So, each child gets 9 eggs."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days.
2. Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food every day. So, for all 3 fish, she spends 3 * $1 = $3 per day.
3. To find out how much she spends in the whole month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May. So, $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on fish food in the month of May.

93"
"Okay, so Patricia starts with 30 roses. She gives 24 of them to her mom, which means she has 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then, she buys 15 more roses. So, she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. Sid first traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. Then, he traveled another 140 miles in 3 hours. To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance and the total time.

First, let's add up the distances:
110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's add up the times:
2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

So, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.

50 mph"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that the first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means the probability of winning with the first ticket is 0.20.

Next, the second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]
This means the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning.

To find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Finally, to express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

12%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. It's also given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we subtract 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]
So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many Carrey collected, we divide the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:
\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]
So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
\[ 27 \text{ (Jim)} + 22 \text{ (Carlos)} + 11 \text{ (Carrey)} = 60 \]

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. To find out how many each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 weekdays, so:

4 carrots/day × 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 2 weekend days, so:

5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, to find out how many carrots he eats in a whole week, we add the carrots from the weekdays and the weekends:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how long the second song is, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and then add that to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

1. **Find the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
   - He sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
   - So, the selling price is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the devices:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday.
   - Total number of devices = 2 + 4 = 6.
   - Total cost = 6 devices \(\times\) $20 per device = $120.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the devices:**
   - Selling price of one device = $40.
   - Total revenue = 6 devices \(\times\) $40 per device = $240.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = $240 - $120 = $120.

So, the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

   \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so:
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - To cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs, you need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the current production:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

2. **Babies dressed in purple:** 
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in purple.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies are dressed in purple.

3. **Babies dressed in blue:**
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in blue.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies are dressed in blue.

4. **Babies wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearing babies also wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 purple-wearing babies also wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearing babies wear bows.

5. **Total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - 2 blue-wearing babies + 2 purple-wearing babies = 4 babies wearing bows.

6. **Probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple.
   - The probability is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

7. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**

"Okay, so the IRS got 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports together. Then, on Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports together. We need to find out how many they got on Wednesday.

First, let's add up the reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of reports they got last week:
5168 (total reports) - 4043 (reports from Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50:
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.
   - Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

3. After a month, he sells another 1/4 of his original land for $30:
   - 1/4 of the original 80 square meters is 20 square meters.
   - So, he sells 20 square meters for $30.
   - Now, he has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

4. Finally, he sells the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
   - 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60

Total earnings = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

First, we need to know how many eggs Cole hid. He hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's see how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding this to the 400 apartments from the first two complexes gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, his total earnings per week are:

"Okay, let's figure out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over 10 years.

1. **5-year-old tree**: It produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: It produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: It produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: It doesn't produce any fruits, so 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: It produces 20 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Next, we add up all the fruits produced from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we did in high school math class.

First, let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem:
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( B \). Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. 

To find the length of the red rope, we use the relationship \( 4B \):
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount \(x\).

After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

First, calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):

\[ 15 - 12 = x \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie originally had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

The mural is made up of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, and the other half is split equally among red, white, and purple.

1. First, we figure out how much of the mural is yellow:
   - The mural is 12 pints in total.
   - Half of the mural is yellow, so:
     \[

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for all the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add up all the areas to get the total area of the house:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each pod costs in the special size box. The special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we want to know how many pods we can get for $1. Since each pod costs $0.10, we can get:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since we use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 is:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

"Okay, let's work through this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills. So, the number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}

   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Starting Chalk Length:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, the remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Chalk Usage Each Day After Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the chalk is left each day.

4. **Calculate the Remaining Chalk for Each Day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

5. **Determine When the Chalk is Less Than 2 Inches:**
   - After 1 day (Tuesday), the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days (Wednesday), the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on the varsity team.

- There are 12 girls in Miss Albert's class, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls are on varsity.
- There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys are on varsity.

Next, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
- Total students on varsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not on varsity. We know there are 24 students in total (12 girls + 12 boys).

- Total students not on varsity = Total students - Total students on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students.

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17. 

17"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. 

First, we calculate three times what Mike bought:
3 times 5 is 15.

Then, we add 2 more to that:
15 plus 2 is 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

17"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of his teeth.
3. The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula: (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100.
6. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

50%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus bought in total. He bought 4000 gallons of milk.
2. The cost of the milk is $3.5 per gallon. So, the total cost for 4000 gallons is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Next, we need to figure out how much of the milk was expired. The problem says that 2/5 of the milk was expired. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how much Mr. Marcellus should get refunded for the expired milk. The refund is for the 1600 gallons of expired milk, and the cost per gallon is $3.5. So, the refund amount is:
   \[
   1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're working through a math problem in high school.

We need to find out how old Colin is right now. Let's call Colin's current age \( C \) and Wendy's current age \( W \).

From the problem, we have two important pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these into equations:

1. Wendy's age is five times Colin's age seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin's age will be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we'll expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To get rid of the fraction, we'll multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Next, we'll subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500. So, to find out how much one book costs, we divide $500 by 100:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We do this by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing these books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

1800"
"Okay, let's figure out how many apples Newton brought home step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, which made 5 more apples fall out.
3. Now, there are 6 apples on the ground (1 from the first event + 5 from the second event).
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket, and threw the last one at the tree, which made 6 more apples fall out.
5. Now, there are 7 apples on the ground (1 from the previous step + 6 from the third event).
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and put them in his pocket.

So, let's add up all the apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event
- 5 apples from the second event
- 6 apples from the third event
- 7 apples from the fourth event

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 19

Newton brought home 19 apples.

"Okay, so Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal. The coal comes in 50 kg bags, and each bag costs $18. 

First, we need to figure out how many bags Ali ordered. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:
\[ 850 \, \text{kg} \div 50 \, \text{kg/bag} = 17 \, \text{bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
\[ 17 \, \text{bags} \times 18 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 306 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Ali's order costs $306.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

1. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
   - So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
     \[
     6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
   - So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
     \[
     6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}
     \]

Next, we need to figure out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

3. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
   - To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

4. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to get the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}
\]

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas in total."

- On Tuesday, Sam ran 5 miles.
- On Wednesday, Sam ran 3 miles.
- On Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles.
- On Friday, Sam ran 3 miles.

Now, let's add up all the miles:

3 (Monday) + 5 (Tuesday) + 3 (Wednesday) + 5 (Thursday) + 3 (Friday) = 19 miles

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many snowballs Jay can actually keep after they start melting. 

- Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
- Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times in an hour, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

So, in one hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs but loses 8, which means he ends up with \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs.

- If he makes 12 snowballs per hour, we divide 60 by 12 to find out how many hours it will take: \(60 \div 12 = 5\).

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Current Age of John:**
   - John is 28 years old now.

2. **Time Frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.

3. **John's Age 20 Years Ago:**
   - If John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between John's and Jim's Ages 20 Years Ago:**
   - 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

5. **Jim's Current Age:**
   - If Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, then he is \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old now.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 piece. Her sister ate 1 more piece than Doxa, so that's 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more piece than her sister, so that's 3 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces they ate:
- Doxa: 1 piece
- Sister: 2 pieces
- Brother: 3 pieces

So, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces.

They all ate 6 slices of apple."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, the net change in bandages on the first day is: \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages added.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They didn't order any more bandages.
   - So, the net change in bandages on the second day is: \(-28\) bandages used.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they got \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - So, the net change in bandages on the third day is: \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages added.

Now, let's add up all the net changes over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over the three days:
\[ 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \]

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the number of bandages they started with on the first day plus the total net change over the three days equals 78 bandages.

So, if we let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with:
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

To find \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the cost of the hair color is $40. That's a flat fee, so it's easy to remember.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair that was cut off is:
10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. So, for 2 inches, the cost is:
2 inches × $30 per inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn in April.

First, we need to find out how much Jen earns in a day. Jen works 7.5 hours a day and earns $1.5 per hour. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings. Jen works 6 days a week, so her weekly earnings are:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.5/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her regular work are:
\[ \$67.5/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Jen also gets an additional $10 for having complete attendance. So, we add this to her monthly earnings:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

Therefore, Jen will receive \$280 in April.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jason made over the two weeks.

- For doing his laundry, he gets $3.00. He did it once, so that's $3.00.
- For cleaning his room, he gets $1.50. He did it once, so that's $1.50.
- For taking the trash out, he gets $0.75 each time. He did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- For emptying the dishwasher, he gets $0.50 each time. He did it six times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishes) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two-week period.

4. By evening, three times as many people as those who came in the morning came in, so that's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens. So, the number of packs of black pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs}
   \]
   Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

3. To find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and the black pens together:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. To find out how much each bottle of scotch costs, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he did scotch. So, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we add 50% of the cost of a bottle of scotch to the cost of a bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles of cognac by the cost per bottle:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the total amount John spends on everything, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spends a total of:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees he planted on the second day is:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees} \]

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than he did on the first day. So, he planted:
\[ 40 + \left(40 \times \frac{1}{4}\right) = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we learned in high school math.

The problem says that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. Let's call the number of coffee mugs \( x \).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out what \( x \) is. We do this by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we did in math class.

First, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes. The problem says one-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we take the total number of fish, which is 66, and divide it by 3:

\[ \frac{66}{3} = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to figure out how many fish are left after we take out the ones with red stripes. We subtract the 22 fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. The problem says that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we multiply 44 by \( \frac{5}{11} \):

\[ 44 \times \frac{5}{11} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, to find out how many fish have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's count how many eyeshadow colors Amy had at the start:

- She had 2 eyeshadow palettes, and each palette has 4 colors. So, for the palettes:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
  \]

- She also had 3 makeup sets, and each set has 6 colors. So, for the makeup sets:
  \[
  3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
  \]

Adding these together, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
  \[
  8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
  \]

Next, her sister steals one of the palettes. Since each palette has 4 colors, the number of colors stolen is:
  \[
  4 \text{ colors}
  \]

Subtracting the stolen colors from the total:
  \[
  26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors}
  \]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
  \]

Subtracting the used colors from the remaining total:
  \[

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Mattison's Height**: Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. **Total Height of the House**: The house is 7 times as high as Mattison. So, the total height of the house is:
   \[
   7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Height of the First Floor**: The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison. So, the height of the first floor is:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Height of the Second Floor**: To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
   \[
   420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many shells the Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells. So, we calculate 40% of 700:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]
So, the Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after the Alphas have found theirs:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]
So, there are 420 shells left.

Now, The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. So, we calculate 60% of 420:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]
So, The Finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells the Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by the Alphas and The Finders from the total number of shells:
\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the Gogetters found 168 shells.

168"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles each per day. That means all 4 dogs together need to walk a total of:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the distances the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"Okay, so John has a house worth $250,000. He gets a loan that's 40% of that. So, we need to find 40% of $250,000:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets a loan of $100,000. Now, he uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. We need to find 60% of $100,000:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.

40000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. He caught three tunas with the following weights:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

To get the total weight, we add these together:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Next, we need to find out how much money he will earn by selling the tunas. The price of tuna is $0.50 per kilogram. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

64"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

First, we need to find out what 11/8 of $72 is. To do this, we multiply 72 by 11 and then divide by 8:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

27"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much water the dehumidifier removes at each setting:

- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total water removed for each setting:

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Water removed: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Water removed: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Water removed: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Finally, we add up all the water removed:

\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:
29"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many water balloons they had at the start. They filled up 10 packs, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons/pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many balloons they used. By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. So, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is 288.

288"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much medicine Saanvi uses for one dose. She uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

So, the amount of the second medicine is:
3 * 14 mL = 42 mL

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to get the total for one dose:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the total amount for one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

448 mL"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali teaches one class.
   - The class has a capacity of 120 students.
   - So, the total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each class has a capacity of 1/8 of Ali's class.
   - First, we need to find out how many students can fit in one of John's classes: \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   - Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacities together: \( 120 + 30 = 150 \) students.

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen owes, including the interest:**
   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.
   - To find the interest, we calculate 2% of $300:
     \[
     300 \times 0.02 = 6
     \]
   - So, the total amount Stephen owes is:
     \[
     300 + 6 = 306
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will have paid over the first 11 months:**
   - Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months.
   - The total amount paid in 11 months is:
     \[
     25 \times 11 = 275
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month:**
   - The total amount owed is $306.
   - The amount already paid is $275.
   - The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is:
     \[
     306 - 275 = 31

So, Stephen will pay \(\boxed{31}\) in the twelfth month."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Jordan has 2 kids who need diapers.
2. Each kid needs 5 diaper changes a day.
3. So, for 2 kids, that's 5 changes per kid times 2 kids, which equals 10 diaper changes a day in total.
4. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 divided by 2, which is 5 diapers.
5. That means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base. The base is 6 inches by 6 inches, and the height is 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar's volume.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim thinks that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The actual number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's work through this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   - When the bus left Chengli city, it had 20 people.

2. **First stop:**
   - 40 more people got on the bus.
   - So, the total number of people on the bus now is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

3. **Second stop:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop got on at the second stop.
   - That means \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \) people got on at the second stop.
   - So, the total number of people on the bus now is \(60 + 30 = 90\).

4. **Third stop:**
   - The number of people on the bus doubled.
   - So, the total number of people on the bus now is \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

5. **Bus capacity:**
   - The bus can hold 200 people.
   - To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: \(200 - 180 = 20\).

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Pauline spends on her visits to the museum before the price increase. She visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, for one year, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

Since she visits the museum for 5 years, the total cost for these 5 years is:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to calculate the new cost of a visit after the price increase. The cost of one visit increases by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original cost:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times \$2 = \$3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

Now, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years at the new cost of $5 per visit. The total cost for these 3 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} \times 3 \text{ years} = \$45 \]

Finally, we add the costs from both periods to find the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits:

\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, Pauline spent a total of:

First, we need to know how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th). So, we multiply the number of students per grade by the number of grades:

\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students. We divide the total number of students by the group size:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the wooden tables cost. John made 4 wooden tables, and each table costs $20. So, we multiply the number of tables by the cost per table:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, we need to find out how much the roof frames cost. John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, we multiply the number of frames by the cost per frame:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to get the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, and the longer piece is 4 times as long as the shorter piece. Let's figure out how long the longer piece is.

First, let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \). Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, it would be \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece, being 4 times longer, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we can calculate the number of pounds needed like this:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he will use. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

Next, for the remaining 20 minutes (since 36 - 16 = 20), the cost drops to $0.20 per minute. So, we calculate:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts of the call:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to set up the problem. Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. The class has five people, and each person gets two treats. So, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats per person} = 10 \text{ treats} \]

Next, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's use \( c \) to represent the number of cupcakes and \( b \) to represent the number of brownies. According to the problem:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

We also know that the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the cost of the manicure and pedicure together with the discount. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. So, without any discount, the total would be:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discount is $15. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the cost for nail art on each nail is $3. So, the total cost for the nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is:

\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

Finally, she has another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, for this magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, the problem tells us that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy costs $40.

   So, the new price in December is:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72

   So, the new price in January is:
   \[
   72 - 36 = 36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much Charlie makes from the regular lessons:
- He charges $80 per hour for regular lessons.
- He has 4 regular lessons today.
- So, for the regular lessons, he makes \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, we need to calculate how much he makes from the veteran lessons:
- He gives a 25% discount to veterans, so the rate for veterans is \( 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per hour.
- He has 2 veteran lessons today.
- So, for the veteran lessons, he makes \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total:
- Total earnings = Earnings from regular lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, Charlie will make 440 dollars for the day.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) he has covered.

3. To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{total distance}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100\% = 60\%
   \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

60%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Madeline ate 6 grapes.**
   - So, she used 6 grapes.

2. **Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice.**
   - If Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.

3. **Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes.**
   - So, their mother used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

4. **To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add up all the grapes used:**
   - Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6
   - Grapes used by her brother: 30
   - Grapes used by their mother: 48

   \[
   6 + 30 + 48 = 84
   \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was 84."
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. There are 82 teachers in total at Rydell Elementary School. Last Friday, 13 of them were sick, so they didn't come to school. That means 82 minus 13 teachers were not there, which leaves us with 69 teachers who were supposed to be at school. But, 9 substitute teachers came in to help. So, we add those 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were there. 

69 + 9 = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese each week.

1. The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
2. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
3. The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs for one week:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

So, Bud spends $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese.

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

520.00"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Time to Clean All Classrooms:**
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   - So, the total time needed is \( 80 \times 15 = 1200 \) minutes.

2. **Total Working Time in 5 Days:**
   - The custodian works 8 hours each day.
   - 8 hours is equal to \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes per day.
   - Over 5 days, the total working time is \( 5 \times 480 = 2400 \) minutes.

3. **Average Time Spent Cleaning Per Day:**
   - The total time to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes.
   - This needs to be done over 5 days.
   - So, the average time spent cleaning per day is \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) minutes.

4. **Percentage of the Day Spent Cleaning:**
   - The custodian works 480 minutes each day.
   - They spend 240 minutes cleaning each day.
   - The percentage of the day spent cleaning is \( \frac{240}{480} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books.

First, let's see how many books each shelf can hold:
- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Number of bookcases: \( \frac{110}{55} = 2 \).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Each dozen costs $2.40. So, the total cost for the eggs is:
5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:
5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has:
60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

So, the total amount she earns from selling the eggs is:
20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

8.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
3. After taking out the red hats, the remaining hats are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]
4. Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = \text{Remaining hats} - \text{Number of blue hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Archie pays for the bag of beef jerky when it's on sale. The original price is $18.00, but it's $3.00 off. So, the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. There are 30 sticks in the bag, and the bag costs $15.00. So, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the total number of questions Audrey has to answer. She has two tests: one with 70 questions and another with 40 questions. So, the total number of questions is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Next, to pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these questions correct. So, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]
This means Audrey needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]
So, she got 42 questions right on the first test.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

35"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're doing it in high school math class.

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \).

The problem says the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is 116. This means the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes is 116. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

So, there are 20 strawberry cubes. 

To find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is 96."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Ara has been playing basketball for 4 years, and she plays 40 games each year. So, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

In each game, she scores 21 points. So, the total number of points she has scored over the 4 years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many customers Jason needs to bring into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we can calculate this by:

\[ 15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers per car} = 30 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers. We know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. So, we can calculate this by:

\[ 30 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls per customer} = 750 \text{ calls} \]

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's count the flashlights:
- Each of the 4 people in the house has a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.
- Each of the 8 rooms has 2 flashlights, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.
- Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles:
- Half of the 8 rooms (which is 4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the 8 rooms (which is also 4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.
- Total candles = 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the flashlights and candles together:
- Total items = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:
56"
"Okay, so Mitchell bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. First, we need to find out how many chips there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

So, there are 110 chips in total. Mitchell's family has 5 members, and they want to share the chips equally. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips.

22"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. Once the fifth side is solved, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

Now, to find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:
10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 items.

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many hours Tim works in a week. He works 6 hours each day for 5 days. So, we multiply 6 hours by 5 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to convert these hours into minutes because each call takes 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 30 hours by 60 minutes per hour:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute calls Tim can handle in 1800 minutes. We divide 1800 minutes by 15 minutes per call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes for the varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish:
- The old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish:
- The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \( 12 \times 6 = 72 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer the new varnish takes compared to the old varnish:
- The difference in time is \( 72 - 42 = 30 \) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"Okay, let's figure out how much water Crista needs for her plants each day.

First, we know Crista has 20 plants in total. Here's the breakdown:
- 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
- The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

Let's calculate the water needed for each group of plants:

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants already accounted for = 4 + 8 = 12
   - Remaining plants = 20 - 12 = 8
   - 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the total water needed:
- 2 cups (half a cup plants) + 8 cups (1 cup plants) + 2 cups (quarter cup plants) = 12 cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water.

1. **Distance on Land**: 
   - Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
   - Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
   - Time to travel 100 yards on land: 
     \[
     \text{Time on Land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Distance in Water**: 
   - The other half of 200 yards is also 100 yards.
   - Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
   - Time to travel 100 yards in water: 
     \[
     \text{Time in Water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time**:
   - To find the total time, we add the time on land and the time in water:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

- $8.00 per pair of pants
- $6.00 per skirt

So, for one week:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, add these up to get the total for one week:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **John's original speaking speed**: 150 words per minute (WPM).
2. **After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster**:
   - So, his new speed is \( 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \) WPM.

3. **Total number of words in 10 pages**:
   - Each page has 450 words.
   - So, 10 pages have \( 10 \times 450 = 4500 \) words.

4. **Time to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM**:
   - Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speed

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, we know that in the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. So, we start with:
- 20 kernels

Next, in the following 30 seconds, three times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, we calculate:
- 3 times 20 = 60 kernels

Then, in the next 30 seconds, four times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. So, we calculate:
- 4 times 20 = 80 kernels

After that, in the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half of what it was in the previous 30 seconds. So, we calculate:
- Half of 80 = 40 kernels

Finally, after Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, we calculate:
- A quarter of 40 = 10 kernels

Now, we add up all the kernels that popped:
- 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many lemons Tim needs for the lemonade for the pool party. The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.

1. **Lemons for the pool party:**
   - 1 gallon of lemonade needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - 4 gallons of lemonade will need \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - So, for 4 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Tim needs for Allen's extra gallon of lemonade, which is twice as tart.

2. **Lemons for Allen's extra gallon:**
   - Allen's gallon is twice as tart, so it needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - So, for 2 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons.

Finally, we add the lemons needed for both the pool party and Allen's extra gallon.

3. **Total lemons needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 + 12 = 36\) lemons

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much food each type of dog eats in a day:
- A German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- A Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms per day = 15 kilograms per day.

Now, we calculate the total amount of food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms per day = 6 kilograms per day.

Then, we add the daily food consumption for both types of dogs to get the total daily consumption:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of food needed for a week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, 21 kilograms per day * 7 days = 147 kilograms per week.

Therefore, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many legs all the 2-legged animals have together. Since there are 10 animals and each has 2 legs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many legs all the 4-legged animals have together. Since there are 15 animals and each has 4 legs:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. 

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 4 blue blocks. The problem also says there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, if there are 4 blue blocks, then there must be:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ yellow blocks} \]

Now, we add the blue and yellow blocks together to find out how many blocks we have so far:
\[ 4 \text{ blue blocks} + 8 \text{ yellow blocks} = 12 \text{ blocks} \]

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find out how many red blocks there are, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
\[ 32 \text{ total blocks} - 12 \text{ blue and yellow blocks} = 20 \text{ red blocks} \]

So, the number of red blocks is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate how far Elvis drove west. He drove for 5 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. So, the distance he traveled west is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far he drove east. He drove for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 miles per hour. So, the distance he traveled east is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how far he is from his house, we need to subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
\[ 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

54"
"Okay, let's figure out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat starts at $9000.
   - It loses 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It loses another 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 0.20 \times 4410 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

3528"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 232 pieces of Starbursts in the bag. We also know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies.

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: Twice the number of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
- Yellow candies: Half the number of red candies, so \(54 \div 2 = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

To find out how many pink candies there are, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is:
43"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Helen spent on her trip to Germany.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \text{ nights} \times \$80 \text{ per night} = \$240 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the bus rides. Helen took the bus 7 times, and each bus ride cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. The price of one night at the hotel is $80, so:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus rides is:
\[ 7 \text{ trips} \times \$8 \text{ per trip} = \$56 \]

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen spent:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of \$296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

296"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to Dallas and Darla. After giving the marbles, Dallas ends up with 21 marbles, but he dropped 4 of them in the playground. So, before dropping the marbles, Dallas had:

21 (after dropping) + 4 (dropped) = 25 marbles

This means Mazie gave Dallas 25 marbles. Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total, the number of marbles she gave to Darla is:

52 (total marbles) - 25 (given to Dallas) = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

27"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are two adults, so:
   \[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8, so:
   \[ 8 \]

3. They buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3, so:
   \[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, add all these costs together:
\[ 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \]

So, the total amount they pay is:
38"
"Okay, so let's figure this out step by step. John's car is broken down, and he needs to push it. We need to find out how much force he needs to use.

First, we need to add up all the weights:
- The car itself weighs 1200 pounds.
- The luggage in the car weighs 250 pounds.
- John has two young children in the car, and each child weighs 75 pounds. So, 75 pounds times 2 is 150 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds

The problem says that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. So, we need to find 1% of 1600 pounds.

To find 1% of a number, you multiply the number by 0.01:
1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push with a force of 16 pounds to move the car.

16 pounds"
"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length around the fence, which is called the perimeter. The fence is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

The length of the fence is 20 feet, and the width is 15 feet. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"Okay, so Mia is 40 years old and she's 16 years younger than Emma. That means Emma is 40 + 16, which is 56 years old. To find the average of their ages, I add 40 and 56 together, which gives me 96. Then I divide 96 by 2, because there are two people. So, 96 divided by 2 is 48. 

The average of their ages is 48."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up all the seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found:
- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

So, the total number of seashells they found is:
214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
- They found 67 cracked seashells.

So, the number of good seashells is:
732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

Therefore, the number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Avery will spend on the place settings for her holiday dinner.

First, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plate and bowl:

1. **Dinner Plates:**
   - Each dinner plate costs $6.00.
   - Avery needs 12 dinner plates.
   - Total cost for dinner plates: \( 12 \times 6 = 72 \) dollars.

2. **Bowls:**
   - Each bowl costs $5.00.
   - Avery needs 12 bowls.
   - Total cost for bowls: \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Salad Plates:**
   - Each salad plate costs $4.00.
   - Avery needs 12 salad plates.
   - Total cost for salad plates: \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost for dinner plates: $72
- Total cost for bowls: $60
- Total cost for salad plates: $48

So, the total amount Avery will spend is:
\[ 72 + 60 + 48 = 180 \]

Avery will spend $180 on place settings.

180"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much feed one pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and they eat twice a day. So, one pig eats:
4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

Next, we have five pigs, so we need to find out how much all five pigs eat in a day. That's:
8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

Now, we need to know how much feed all five pigs eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the amount of feed the pigs eat in a week from the total amount of feed ordered:
300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, after a week, Dexter will have 20 pounds of feed left.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Total Hot Dogs Needed:**
   - John invited 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - So, the total number of hot dogs needed is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) hot dogs.

2. **Hot Dogs Already Available:**
   - John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.

3. **Additional Hot Dogs Needed:**
   - To find out how many more hot dogs John needs, we subtract the hot dogs he already has from the total needed.
   - Additional hot dogs needed = \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) hot dogs.

4. **Number of Packs Needed:**
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - To find out how many packs John needs, we divide the additional hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack.
   - Number of packs needed = \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \) packs.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack.
   - Total cost = \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each. So, the money from cupcakes is:
  \[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, the money from cookies is:
  \[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, let's add the money from cupcakes and cookies to find the total money she makes:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances spends on the trays.

- She buys 5 trays at $4 each. So, the cost of the trays is:
  \[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she makes to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, Frances has \$60 left."
"Okay, let's think through this step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - The ice cream truck starts with 5 children following it.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of these 5 children is joined by another child.
   - So, the number of children doubles: \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of these 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - So, the number of children increases by \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
   - Total number of children now: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - The original 5 children give up and leave.
   - So, the number of children remaining: \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

"Okay, so Mamou is helping out by giving meals to families who lost their food and homes because of the floods. She has 1,360 meals to give out. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals. On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals. And on Sunday, she gave out 48 meals. 

To find out how many meals she has left, we need to add up the meals she already gave out and then subtract that number from the total number of meals she started with.

So, 64 meals on Friday + 30 meals on Saturday + 48 meals on Sunday = 142 meals given out.

Now, we subtract the meals given out from the total meals: 1,360 meals - 142 meals = 1,218 meals left.

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"Okay, let's figure this out. James found some coins in the vending machine: a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. 

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so two nickels are worth 10 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 7 dimes are worth 70 cents.

Now, let's add them up:
25 (quarter) + 10 (two nickels) + 70 (seven dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We have 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - So, the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old.
   - The other brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother, so he is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) years old.

3. Now, we add up the ages of all the siblings:
   - The total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.
   - The total age of the sisters is 48 years.

4. Finally, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters:
   - \(36 + 48 = 84\) years.

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day:
- She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- So, each day she spends \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes meditating.

Next, let's find out how much time she spends meditating in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, she spends \(30 \times 7 = 210\) minutes meditating.

Now, let's calculate the total meditation time over 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, she spends \(210 \times 4 = 840\) minutes meditating.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- So, in one week, she spends \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes on yoga.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends on yoga over 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, she spends \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes on yoga.

Finally, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is \(840 + 1200 = 2040\) minutes.

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how big the quilt will be. We need to add up the areas of all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, we calculate the area for the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total area for the small t-shirts is \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet.

Next, we calculate the area for the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total area for the medium t-shirts is \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet.

Then, we calculate the area for the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total area for the large t-shirts is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet.

Now, we add up all the areas to get the total area of the quilt:
- Total area = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many seeds are in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower like this:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we do:
\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of seeds in a large sunflower is:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day.
2. They sell each bar for $2.
3. We need to find out how much money they make in two weeks.

First, let's find out how many days are in two weeks:
- There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Next, let's calculate how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks:
- If they make 5000 bars each day, in 14 days they will make 5000 * 14 = 70000 bars.

Now, let's find out how much money they make from selling all these bars:
- If each bar is sold for $2, then for 70000 bars, they will make 70000 * 2 = $140,000.

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store has a deal where you buy one T-shirt and get the second one at 50% off. Each T-shirt originally costs $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% off: $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
$8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40.

- The discount is 40%, so Jake pays 60% of the original price: $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
$36."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Ryan gets $6 each week for doing his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so:
\[ 4 \, \text{ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we need to see how many tickets he can buy with $13:

"To figure out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much it costs to make one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

So, the total cost to make one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, we need to find out the total cost to make 10 jars:
$44 per jar * 10 jars = $440

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
$50 per jar * 10 jars = $500

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"Okay, let's figure out the total amount of money in the jar. We need to add up the value of all the quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

- Quarters: There are 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 32 quarters * 25 cents = 800 cents.
- Dimes: There are 95 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 95 dimes * 10 cents = 950 cents.
- Nickels: There are 120 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, 120 nickels * 5 cents = 600 cents.
- Pennies: There are 750 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent. So, 750 pennies * 1 cent = 750 cents.

Now, let's add all these values together to get the total in cents:
800 cents (quarters) + 950 cents (dimes) + 600 cents (nickels) + 750 cents (pennies) = 3100 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we divide 3100 cents by 100 to get the total in dollars:
3100 cents / 100 = 31 dollars.

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is:

- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many days Josh is open in a week. He's closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he's open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars each day he's open, we multiply 3 cars/day by 5 days/week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he earns in a week. He gets paid $4 for each car, so we multiply the number of cars by the payment per car:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in high school.

First, let's list out how many cookies Randy starts with:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Next, Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has left:
- Total cookies = 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

So, Randy has 23 cookies now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half:
- Half of 12 is 6.

So, he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

Next, we calculate the total money he will get from each half:
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $5 each:
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30
  \]
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $7 each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42
  \]

Now, we add the amounts from both halves to find the total money Matthew will earn:
\[
30 + 42 = 72
\]

So, Matthew would earn $72.

72"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes each day for 14 days. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Norman High School has an average of 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 

First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has. We do this by multiplying 4000 by 3/4:

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students.

Next, we need to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"Okay, so the Adams family is making a bunch of cookies. They've made 7995 cookies in total. Out of these, 2595 are rainbow cookies and 3075 are oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

So, we do:
7995 (total cookies) - 2595 (rainbow cookies) - 3075 (oatmeal cookies)

First, subtract the rainbow cookies:
7995 - 2595 = 5400

Then, subtract the oatmeal cookies:
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

But Igor made some mistakes:
- He only got half as many test tubes as requested, so he got \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- He got two more Petri dishes than requested, so he got \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

In total, Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench. We need to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let's add up the items Igor actually placed on the bench:
- 8 test tubes
- 16 Petri dishes
- \( 7 - x \) beakers (where \( x \) is the number of beakers he lost)

The total number of items is:
\[ 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many screws are needed for one table. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, we need:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"Okay, so if there are 10 eggs in one basket and the other basket has twice as many, that means the second basket has 20 eggs. If you add the eggs from both baskets together, you get 10 + 20, which equals 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ 430 + 320 = 750 \]
So, Kim raised $750.

Next, Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]
So, Maryam raised $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

So, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
2180"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. **Vanessa's Distance**: Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. **Aaron's Distance**: Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did. That means Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. **Aaron's Time**: Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Now, let's figure out how fast Aaron and Vanessa run.

- **Aaron's Speed**: Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. So, his speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \). This means Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes.
- **Vanessa's Speed**: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, Vanessa runs 1 mile in \( 8 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles.

- **Vanessa's Time**: Since Vanessa runs 1 mile in 16 minutes, for 4 miles, it would take her \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Okay, so the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There's 200 feet of dock, so he needs:

\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

He already has 6 feet of line. So, he needs to buy:

\[ 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

594"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much one reservation makes. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

They also order a $5 bottle of wine, so the total for one reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. So, the total revenue for one night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total revenue for the week is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the restaurant makes:
180 dollars a week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much the vendor spent on the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Next, we need to calculate the profit. The vendor made a 25% profit on the total cost. To find the profit, we multiply the total cost by 25% (or 0.25):
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]

3. Now, we add the profit to the total cost to find the total selling price:
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is 18 years old, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is 37 years old now, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. **Ana's Peeling Time:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), she can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Jane's Peeling Time:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), she can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges in an hour.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges in an hour.
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the radiator costs $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find out how much he saves, we calculate 80% of $400:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, he saves $320. Now, we subtract that from the original price to find out how much he actually pays for the radiator:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid a total of:

230"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we did in high school math class.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

First, let's set up some equations. Let's say:
- \( c \) is the number of chickens.
- \( k \) is the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

So, we can write these equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (because the total number of animals is 20)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (because chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70)

Now, let's simplify the second equation. We can divide everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have two simpler equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To solve these, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now, we can substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"Okay, so Henry and his 3 friends have 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. First, we need to figure out how many slices there are in total. 

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we have 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) sharing these 56 slices. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
