"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. That's a lot of eggs!

Next, Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs each day.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are left for her to sell. If she starts with 16 eggs and uses 7, then she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells each of these 9 eggs for $2. So, to find out how much money she makes, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for a robe, we need to add up the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, it needs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts in total} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Josh spent in total. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the house is worth after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find 150% of the original value, we multiply $80,000 by 1.5:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, to find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. James runs 3 sprints each time he goes out, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Next, we find out how many meters he runs in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs 540 meters a week.

540"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much feed all the chickens need in a day. Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. So, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken gets:
   \[
   20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Next, we need to see how much feed Wendi has already given to the chickens. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much more feed is needed for the final meal. We subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The store has a special deal: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs only 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's see how many pairs of glasses Kylar is buying. Since he's buying 16 glasses, that means he's buying 8 pairs (because 16 divided by 2 is 8).

Now, in each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar is buying 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80
   \]
   So, Charleston has 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160
   \]
   So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up all the sheep:
\[
20 \text{ (Seattle)} + 80 \text{ (Charleston)} + 160 \text{ (Toulouse)} = 260
\]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, figure out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart:**
   - The file is 200 GB.
   - Carla downloads 2 GB every minute.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.

2. **Calculate how long it takes to download 80 GB:**
   - If Carla downloads 2 GB per minute, then 80 GB will take \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \) minutes.

3. **Add the time for the Windows restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.
   - So, the total time so far is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Now, Carla has to start the download all over again:**
   - The whole file is 200 GB.
   - At 2 GB per minute, it will take \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \) minutes to download the entire file again.

5. **Add the time for the full download to the time already spent:**
   - The total time is \( 60 + 100 = 160 \) minutes.

So, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, he drives:

\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. But he spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move at all during that time.

After the 2 hours, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. So, he covers:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he drives for the remaining time, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, at 80 miles per hour. So, he covers:

\[ 80 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled back home:

\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we need to find out how far he is from home. He initially drove 180 miles away, and he traveled 135 miles back home. So, the distance from home is:

\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

45"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Eliza made this week.

First, we need to know how much she makes for the first 40 hours. She gets $10 for each of those hours. So, for 40 hours, she makes:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we need to figure out how much she makes for the extra hours. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 hours of overtime. For overtime, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate. Her regular rate is $10, so her overtime rate is:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12 \]

Now, we calculate how much she makes for the 5 hours of overtime:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads. That's easy to remember, right?

2. **Second Month:**
   - The downloads were three times as many as the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3.
   - \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.30.
   - \( 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \).
   - Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month.
   - \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Now, we add up the downloads from all three months.
   - \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Toula spent at the bakery. I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen costs $68.
- So, the cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen costs $80.
- So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Finally, the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen costs $55.
- So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Initial Cost to Plant the Tree**: Carlos needs to spend $90 to plant the lemon tree.
2. **Lemons per Year**: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year.
3. **Price per Lemon**: Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed the Tree**: It costs $3 each year to take care of the tree.

First, let's find out how much money Carlos makes from selling lemons each year:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree from the money he makes:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

So, Carlos makes $7.5 each year after covering the costs of taking care of the tree.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the $90 he spent to plant the tree:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

1. **First, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the end.**

2. **Before she got to the orange house, she had more.** She sold half of what she had left at the orange house, so before that, she must have had twice as many. So, before the orange house, she had:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. **Before she got to the red house, she had even more.** She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, so before that, she had:
   \[
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

4. **Before she got to the green house, she had the most.** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so before that, she had three times as many. So, before the green house, she had:
   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many students are in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students are in contemporary dance:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the 4 students in contemporary dance:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students are in jazz dance:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to find out how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

5. To find the percentage of the entire class that is in hip-hop dance, we use:
   \[
   \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

So, 60% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

60%"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in middle school math class.

The merchant has two choices:
1. Buy jewelry worth $5,000.
2. Buy electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

The financial advisor says:
- The jewelry market will go up by 2.5%.
- The electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%.

To find out which one will make more money, we need to calculate how much each will be worth after the market goes up.

### Jewelry:
- Initial cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- To find the increase, we multiply $5,000 by 2.5% (which is 0.025):
  \[
  5000 \times 0.025 = 125
  \]
- So, the profit from jewelry is $125.

### Electronic Gadgets:
- Initial cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- To find the increase, we multiply $8,000 by 1.2% (which is 0.012):
  \[
  8000 \times 0.012 = 96
  \]
- So, the profit from electronic gadgets is $96.

Now, we compare the two profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry because it will make more money.

The maximum profit is:

"Okay, so imagine you have two toy trains starting from the same spot. They both go 80 miles to the west, which is like moving the trains to the left on a map. The next day, they both go 150 miles to the north, which is like moving the trains up on the map.

To find out how far each train traveled in total, you just add the miles they went to the west and the miles they went to the north. So, you do 80 miles + 150 miles.

80 + 150 = 230

So, each train traveled 230 miles in total over the two days.

230"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jill makes in a year from her two jobs.

First, we need to find out how much she makes each week from teaching. She teaches for 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 for each hour. So, we multiply 35 by 20:
35 hours * $20/hour = $700 a week from teaching.

Next, we calculate how much she makes each week from being a cheerleading coach. She coaches for 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 for each hour. So, we multiply 15 by 30:
15 hours * $30/hour = $450 a week from coaching.

Now, we add the two amounts to find out how much she makes in total each week:
$700 (teaching) + $450 (coaching) = $1150 a week.

Jill works 50 weeks a year, so to find out her annual salary, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50:
$1150 * 50 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

57500"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. We need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks, so we multiply the weekly amount by 4: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she uses: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then she walked 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the rest of the trail, we need to figure out how much time she has left and how far she has left to go.

First, let's figure out how long she should take to finish the whole 12-mile trail if she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. 

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

We want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \text{ miles per hour} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

To find the total time, we can rearrange the equation:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Marissa should take 3 hours to complete the 12-mile trail. She has already taken 2 hours, so she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to finish the trail.

Now, let's find out how far she has left to walk. She has already walked 6 miles, so she has:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]
left to walk.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So, the speed she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we have 10 liters of orange drink, and it's said that two-thirds of it is water. So, we need to find out how much water is in those 10 liters. We do this by multiplying 10 by two-thirds:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, we now have 9 liters of orange drink left. Since the orange drink is still two-thirds water, the amount of water in the 9 liters is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of it is water. So, we calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, we mix the 9 liters of orange drink (which has 6 liters of water) with the 15 liters of pineapple drink (which has 9 liters of water). The total amount of water in the mixture is:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

1. **Find Raymond's age:**
   - Samantha is 31 years old.
   - Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha.
   - So, Raymond is \(31 + 6 = 37\) years old.

2. **Determine when Raymond's son was born:**
   - Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old.
   - To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age.
   - So, \(37 - 23 = 14\).

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kyle bought the book for $19.50, and this price is after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% (the full price) would be. 

Here’s how we can do it:
1. Let's call the original price \( P \).
2. Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation: 
   \[
   0.75 \times P = 19.50
   \]
3. To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
   \[
   P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
   \]
4. Now, let's do the division:
   \[
   P = 26
   \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

26.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the things Marie bought except for the pizza. 

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- Each pack of milk costs $3, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Each apple costs $1.50, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these up:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount she spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the amount she spent on pizza by the cost of one box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\].

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothes.

First, we need to find out how much Mishka spent on the shorts:
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is \( 16.50 \times 3 = 49.50 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pants:
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \( 22.50 \times 3 = 67.50 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Mishka spent on the shoes:
- One pair of shoes costs $42.00.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \( 42.00 \times 3 = 126.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00 \) dollars.

So, Mishka spent 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Find out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - So, in 60 days, she will eat:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs:**
   - Each carton has 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

So, Cynthia will spend **$16.00** on ice cream after 60 days."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in math class.

Henry went on a 60-mile bike trip. He made two stops. The first stop was after he rode 20 miles. The second stop was 15 miles before he finished his trip. 

To find out how far he rode between these two stops, we need to figure out where the second stop was. Since the trip is 60 miles long and he stopped 15 miles before the end, he must have stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, we know:
- First stop: 20 miles
- Second stop: 45 miles

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

Gloria is looking at a pair of boots. She also sees two pairs of high heels. One pair costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much as the first pair. So, the second pair costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

Now, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the boots cost \( B \) dollars, then:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years.
2. Their total age now is 162 years. We need to find out how many years each part of the ratio represents.
3. If we add the parts of the ratio together, we get 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
4. So, each part of the ratio represents \( \frac{162}{18} = 9 \) years.
5. Now, we can find Darrell's age by multiplying his part of the ratio by 9: \( 7 \times 9 = 63 \) years.
6. Similarly, we can find Allen's age by multiplying his part of the ratio by 9: \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \) years.
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: \( 99 + 10 = 109 \) years.

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend guesses there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
2. The second friend says it's 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guesses 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says it's 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we do 80 times 0.25, which is 20. So, 25% more than 80 is 80 plus 20, which is 100. The third friend guesses 100 jelly beans.

Now, to find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

John has 10 dogs, and each dog needs 0.5 hours of care every day. So, to find out how much time he spends on all the dogs in one day, we multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog needs:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily time by 7:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use some simple math to figure out how many gold coins she has.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

Now, we know the total number of coins is 110. So, we can write an equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( S \):

1. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[ 2S = 80 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, we need to find the number of gold coins:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem says Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first find half of Raymond's jewels:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to get Aaron's jewels:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem says Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we need to find out what 25% of 4 points is:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **How many yogurts does Terry eat in 30 days?**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   - So, in 30 days, he eats: \( 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \).

2. **How much does each yogurt cost?**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - So, the cost per yogurt is: \( \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \).

3. **How much does Terry spend on 60 yogurts?**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is: \( 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \).

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. John has 13 lego sets and he sells each for $15. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, John buys 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the video games is:

8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount of money he had before buying the video games was:

$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

But we know he actually had $195 from selling the lego sets. Since he used all the money from the lego sets to buy the video games and still has $5 left, it means he sold all his lego sets.

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

0"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as long as the first day, which means he runs for 1.5 hours each of those days.

First, let's add up all the time he spends running:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time running in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **First, we need to know how fast Dana can run and walk.**
   - We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running, so running is twice as fast as skipping.
   - So, Dana can run at \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Next, we find out how fast Dana can walk.**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - So, walking is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Now, let's figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking.**
   - She has 6 hours in total.
   - She spends one-third of the time running, so \(6 \div 3 = 2\) hours running.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours walking.

4. **Calculate the distance Dana runs.**
   - Running speed is 6 miles per hour.
   - She runs for 2 hours, so the distance is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance Dana walks.**
   - Walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.
   - She walks for 4 hours, so the distance is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

6. **Add the distances together to get the total distance.**
   - Total distance = 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

So, Dana can travel **18 miles** in six hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, that means Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Now, if Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon’s iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

So, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in math class.

Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times as far. So, we need to multiply 400 feet by 3:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, we multiply:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to know how many calories you can still eat today. You have a daily target of 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories. So, we subtract:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips 200 calories would be. The whole bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories. We can find out how many grams are in one calorie by dividing the total grams by the total calories:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

So, for 200 calories, we multiply:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"Okay, let's figure out Charlie's net profit step by step.

1. **How much beeswax does Charlie need?**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **How much does the beeswax and wicks cost?**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.

3. **How much money does Charlie make from selling the candles?**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **What is Charlie's net profit?**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

   - Each article takes 4 hours.
   - Total hours on Monday: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
   - \(\frac{2}{5}\) of 5 is \(5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2\).
   - So, she wrote 2 more articles on Tuesday.
   - Total articles on Tuesday: \(5 + 2 = 7\).
   - Each article takes 4 hours.
   - Total hours on Tuesday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in it yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, one for each cup of coffee.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is also:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 80 from both sides:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of one tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he bought 5 blue ties, he must have bought:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much each red tie costs. The problem says that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, we calculate the cost of a red tie like this:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

So, each red tie costs $60. Now, we can find out how much John spent on all the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, Tracy cut the wire into pieces that are 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she got, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.

   So, there are 120 units in total.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:
   \[ 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \]
   So, 90 units are occupied.

3. Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs that is. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 1764 by 12:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294

So, Tom's ship travels 30 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel back. On the way back, his ship goes 6 miles every hour. We need to find out how many hours it takes to travel 30 miles at this speed. We do this by dividing the distance by the speed:

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times 60 \text{ dollars per tire} = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

The money made from fixing car tires on Thursday is:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times 40 \text{ dollars per tire} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money made on Thursday is:
\[ 360 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} = 520 \text{ dollars} \]

On Friday, the mechanic only fixed 12 car tires. The money made from fixing car tires on Friday is:

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Marcy gets a special deal on her pension. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000 every year when she retires. But if she works for more than 20 years, she gets a little extra each year after 20 years. For each year after 20, she gets 5% more of the $50,000.

So, if Marcy works for 30 years, she works 10 years more than 20 years. For each of those 10 years, she gets 5% more of the $50,000.

First, let's find out what 5% of $50,000 is:
5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Since she works 10 years more than 20 years, she gets 10 times $2,500:
10 * $2,500 = $25,000

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $25,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - Aleena pays $140 each month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - So, for the first half, she pays: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The price goes down by 10%.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the new monthly price is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, for the second half, she pays: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total for the Year:**
   - Add the amounts for the first and second halves of the year.
   - Total amount: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, by the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Find out how many miles Sophia's car can go on one gallon of gas:**
   - Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how many miles she can go on one gallon, we divide the miles by the gallons:
     \[
     \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank:
     \[
     \text{Total miles} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Time spent in one session:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - Then he reads for half as long as he watched TV, which is 1 hour (because half of 2 hours is 1 hour).

   So, in one session, he spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time spent in one week:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many people each school sends. Each school has:
- A girls' basketball team with 5 players
- A boys' basketball team with 5 players
- A coach for the girls' team
- A coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, that's:
5 (girls' players) + 5 (boys' players) + 1 (girls' coach) + 1 (boys' coach) = 12 people

Now, there are 4 schools, so we need to multiply the number of people each school sends by the number of schools:
12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Diamonds**: The chest has 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175:

   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280

   So, there are 280 emeralds.

Now, let's add up all the gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. It says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, then there must be 2 times 60 boys, which is 120 boys.
3. Now, we need to find out how many students there are in total. We add the number of girls and boys together: 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.
4. The problem also tells us that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5: 180 students ÷ 5 = 36 teachers.

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. So, we need to figure out how much money she gets in total from her allowance. We do this by multiplying the amount she gets each week by the number of weeks:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, Bailey gets $40 from her allowance over 8 weeks.

Now, we know that at the end of these 8 weeks, Bailey has $100 in total. This $100 includes the money she started with plus the $40 she got from her allowance. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the $40 from the $100:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many dance classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes every weekday, and there are 5 weekdays. So, for the weekdays, she teaches:
5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, the total number of classes in a week is:
25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes

Next, we need to find out how many students she has in total. Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is:
33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students

Now, we need to calculate how much money Judy makes. She charges $15.00 per student. So, the total money she makes is:
495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00

So, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that the first recipe has 20 instructions. That's pretty straightforward.

Next, the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, if the first one has 20 instructions, the second one will have 20 times 2, which is 40 instructions.

Now, to find out how many instructions Kelian has to read in total, we add the instructions from both recipes together. So, 20 instructions from the first recipe plus 40 instructions from the second recipe equals 60 instructions.

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions in total.

Next, we need to find out how much he made from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sold 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake costs $4.
- So, the money from cheesecakes is 23 slices * $4/slice = $92.

Now, we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes to get the total amount:
- Total money = $129 + $92 = $221.

So, Tommy raised $221 for his charity.

   5 \times 150 = 750
   \]
   So, the total cost of the cell phones is $750.

2. **Calculate the interest:**
   There's a 2% interest on the total cost.
   \[
   2\% \text{ of } 750 = 0.02 \times 750 = 15

- Petunias cost $1.87, which rounds to $2.
- Begonias cost $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- For marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- For petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- For begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels. Each level is half the size of the one below it. The top level, which is the 4th level, has 16 square feet.

To find the size of the other levels, we can work backwards:

- The 4th level is 16 square feet.
- The 3rd level is twice the size of the 4th level, so it's \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet.
- The 2nd level is twice the size of the 3rd level, so it's \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet.
- The 1st level is twice the size of the 2nd level, so it's \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much dog food the puppy needs for the first 180 days. The vet said 1 cup of food per day. So, we multiply 180 days by 1 cup:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much food the puppy needs for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days are:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food per day. So, we multiply 185 days by 2 cups:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food needed for the whole year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. The problem says that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, the problem tells us that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much laundry Raymond does, we take half of Sarah's laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount David does. We subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in each type of package.

1. **Packages of 3 for $2.50:**
   - Each package has 3 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, we need \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
   - The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Packages of 2 for $1:**
   - Each package has 2 flowers.
   - To get 18 flowers, we need \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
   - The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, let's see how much money Vincent saves by choosing the cheaper option:
- The cost with packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost with packages of 2 is $9.
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

"Okay, so John takes his new dog to the groomer. The groomer says it costs $100, but because John is a new customer, he gets a 30% discount. 

To find out how much the discount is, you take 30% of $100. That's like saying 30 out of 100, which is 30 divided by 100, and then you multiply that by $100. So, 30 divided by 100 is 0.3, and 0.3 times $100 is $30. That means the discount is $30.

Now, to find out how much John has to pay, you subtract the discount from the original price. So, $100 minus $30 is $70.

So, the grooming cost is $70."

Since there are two girls, we multiply 4 liters by 2:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, we add the water the girls and the boy got:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water they got from the original 24 liters:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. 

First, let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

Now, we know the total number of games they played is 22. So, the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is 22. We can write this as:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Let's solve this equation:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"Okay, let's figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic.

First, we need to know how much each type of dinosaur will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Now, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children:
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- So, the total for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Now, we subtract 12 from this total to find the number of rabbits:
\[ 180 - 12 = 168 \text{ rabbits} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[ 348 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many boys there are in Grade 5. We know that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys. So, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

So, there are 80 boys in Grade 5.

Next, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since there are 200 students in total and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:

\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. So, we calculate how many girls are in the Girl Scouts:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

So, 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is:

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we need to multiply 9 by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James slept 6 hours. Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Freda makes tomato sauce.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces and contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.

2. **Find the Initial Volume of Tomatoes:**
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - So, the initial volume of tomatoes is \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Calculate the Number of Cans Used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume by the volume of one can:
   - \( \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \).

4. **Calculate the Number of Tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - So, the total number of tomatoes used is \( 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \).

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Then, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many potted plants Mary has before she gives any away. She already has 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, we multiply:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these to the 80 plants she already had:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Now, Mary is going to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. So, we need to subtract these 40 plants from the total:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, after giving away the plants, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we need to find 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we add 10 to 60:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the doorbell rang a total of 175 times."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up all the pages Solo has to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract those from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

John drinks water 4 times a day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses

On the weekends, he drinks water 3 times a day. There are 2 weekend days, so:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Now, we add the glasses of water from the weekdays and the weekends:
20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. The city is 42 miles wide. We need to find out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city.

First, we figure out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]
So, there are 14 segments of 3 miles each in 42 miles.

Next, we know that each 3-mile segment takes 10 minutes to cover. So, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:
\[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \]
So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third means 1/3, so:

\[
750 \times \frac{1}{3} = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each side of the box (1 inch from each side).

- The outer length of the box is 5 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) to get the inner length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
- The outer width of the box is 6 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) to get the inner width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
- The outer height of the box is 4 inches. Subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) to get the inner height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height:
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

First, let's add up the time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, but we'll leave out Wednesday for now.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours (1 hour + 1 hour)

Now, let's add these times together:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes long. To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we divide the total time on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, before he dropped them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
2. He baked 15 more cookies than he planned. So, the number of cookies he planned to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
3. He wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, if 100 is twice the number of cookies he baked last year, then last year he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

1. First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

2. Next, we need to figure out how much cashback we get. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   - So, 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00 cashback

3. Finally, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much we actually pay.
   - $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after the cashback, the gas will cost $28.00.

   \]
   Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

2. Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply:
   \[

   Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

3. Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups both of them ate to get the total:
   \[
   48 + 42 = 90

   Together, they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

4. To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can find out how many feet she rows in one second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds:

\[ \text{Feet per second} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far she rows in 64 seconds. We multiply the feet per second by the total number of seconds:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much water the boat took on. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, we can find out how much water it takes on for 80 feet by setting up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water for 80 feet} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos.

First, we need to find out how many photos Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone holds 6 times more photos than Brittany's, we divide 1800 by 6:
\[ 1800 \div 6 = 300 \]
So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos.

Next, we know that 300 photos (the number Brittany's phone can hold) is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. To find the number of ducks, we divide 300 by 50:
\[ 300 \div 50 = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on the lumber:
- She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, and each board cost her $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- So, the total amount she spent is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell the lumber for now that prices have gone up by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate how much she will make from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- So, the total revenue she will make is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

Finally, to find out her profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a problem in math class.

First, we know that Katy makes her coffee using a special mix. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. This means the total parts of the mix are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

Now, we're told that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. This means all 20 parts add up to 120.

To find out how much one part is, we divide 120 by 20:
\[ 120 \div 20 = 6 \]

So, each part of the mix is 6 units. Since the sugar is 7 parts of the mix, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

Each pair of shoes costs $60. So, to find out how much John paid in total, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair. That's 6 pairs times $60 per pair, which equals $360.

So, John paid $360 in total.

   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container still has 5 vehicles. To find out how many containers were brought in on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. This salary was 30% more than Lylah's salary. To find out what Lylah's salary was, we can set up a simple equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 30\% \text{ of Lylah's salary} \]

This can be written as:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Combining the terms on the right side:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was about $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is now, four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 40\% \text{ of 40000} \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

So, Adrien's salary now is $56,000.

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we can calculate her new salary as:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 40\% \text{ of 30769.23} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

So, Lylah's salary now is about $43,076.92.

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add their new salaries together:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

99076.92"

3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste the stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

Now, let's put this into a simple equation. The total number of spoons Julia had before using any is the number of spoons she bought plus the 5 spoons her husband bought:

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, if he bought 38 chicken sausages, he must have bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. Now, to find out how many sausages he bought in total, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82.

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"Okay, so let's think about this problem step by step. If Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we need to add 20 to the number of friends Lily made to find out how many friends Amy made.

So, Amy made:
50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70 friends

Now, to find out how many friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together. 

120"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much each item costs:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate how much Dillon will spend on each type of fruit:
- For 4 watermelons:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For 20 peppers:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For 10 oranges:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **How many people does the hospital see each day?**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.

2. **How long does each visit take?**
   - Each visit takes 24 minutes.

3. **How many minutes do all the visits take in one day?**
   - If 500 people each visit for 24 minutes, then the total time is:
     \[
     500 \text{ people} \times 24 \text{ minutes/person} = 12,000 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **How many hours is that?**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     12,000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **How much does the hospital charge patients per hour?**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.

6. **How much does the hospital make in total from patients?**
   - If the hospital charges $200 per hour and sees patients for 200 hours, then:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **How much do the doctors charge the hospital per hour?**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.

8. **How much does the hospital pay the doctors in total?**
   - If the doctors charge $150 per hour and work for 200 hours, then:
     \[
     200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

9. **What is the hospital's profit?**
   - The profit is the total amount the hospital makes minus the total amount it pays the doctors:
     \[
     40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Nissa hires 60 people to play elves. Then, a third of them quit because some kids got sick on them. A third of 60 is 20, so 20 elves quit. 

Now, we have:
60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Next, 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves that were left:

40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, 30 elves are left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than what he spent in May. So, in June, he spent $500 - $60, which is $440. To find out how much he spent in total for both months, we add the amounts from May and June together: $500 + $440. That gives us a total of $940.

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to count how many times Pam and Fred rode the rides.

Pam:
- Roller coaster: 2 times
- Luge: 2 times
So, Pam rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 times.

Fred:
- Roller coaster: 4 times
- Luge: 2 times
So, Fred rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up all the rides:
- Total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = 4 + 6 = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so we need to multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride:
- Total tickets = 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets

So, Pam and Fred used 60 tickets that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.
3. The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we add the miles from Monday and Tuesday and subtract that from the total:

- Monday: 4 miles
- Tuesday: 24 miles
- Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles

So, the miles he walked on Wednesday is:
- Total miles (Monday to Wednesday) - Total miles (Monday and Tuesday) = \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

First, we need to know how much Tom spends on car washes each month. He gets 4 car washes a month, and each one costs $15. So, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash:

4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in a whole year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

First, we need to know how many video games Brian has after he lost some. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5. So, we do:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we first find out what 3 times Brian's video games is:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we're told that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, we need to find out how many of the 9 unicorns are female:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6

First, we need to find out how much the subs cost. Rory ordered 2 subs, and each one costs $7.50. So, we do:
2 * $7.50 = $15.00

Next, we calculate the cost of the chips. Rory got 2 bags, and each bag costs $1.50. So, we do:
2 * $1.50 = $3.00

Then, we figure out the cost of the cookies. Rory ordered 2 cookies, and each one costs $1.00. So, we do:
2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total before any extra fees:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Rory also has to pay a 20% delivery fee. To find this, we take 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the tip to the total cost and the delivery fee:
$20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, Rory's delivery order will cost:
$29.00

29.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark completed in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark can do 5 questions every hour.
- He had 8 hours to work on the test.
- So, the number of questions he completed is 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions.

The first test had 75 questions in total. So, the number of questions he didn't finish is:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.

For the second test:
- Mark can still do 5 questions every hour.
- This time, he had 6 hours to work on the test.
- So, the number of questions he completed is 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions.

The second test had 100 questions in total. So, the number of questions he didn't finish is:
100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions he left incomplete in total, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions.

So, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem says that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. 

First, we need to find out what four times the number of blue gumballs is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, we add 22 to this number to find the number of pink gumballs:
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. We need to find out how many are semi-automatic.

To do this, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Next, we need to find what percentage 4 is of 20. We do this by dividing 4 by 20 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \frac{4}{20} \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that:
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out.

1. **First, let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).**
2. **Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).**
3. **Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).**

Now, we know the total number of bees is 700. So, we can write an equation:

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Let's add these up:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens.

Now, let's find the number of baby bees:

\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:

\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know what items are food and what items are not food, because only the nonfood items have a tax.

- Food items: milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars)
- Nonfood items: light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), roach traps (4 dollars)

Now, let's add up the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total for food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Next, let's add up the cost of the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total for nonfood items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on the nonfood items, we need to calculate the tax:
- 10% of 10 dollars = 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar

Now, add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
- Total for nonfood items with tax: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items (including tax):
- Total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Kim will make each week.

First, we need to find out how many clients Kim will have in total:
- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for these 8 clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 2 bottles cost 2 * $2 = $4.
- Each pack of cloths costs $5.
- So, the total cost for one client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.
- For 8 clients, the total expenses are 8 * $9 = $72.

Now, we know Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many pineapples John has in his field. He has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, we multiply:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, we divide:
\[ 12 \text{ months} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples he has by the number of times he can harvest:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]
So, the second set has 1500 pieces.

Then, he has a third set that has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set. So, we need to divide 500 by 4:
\[ 500 \div 4 = 125 \]
So, the third set has 125 pieces.

Now, we need to add up all the pieces from the three sets:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**

   - Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the first group leave.
   - Twice 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left and didn't return yet come back.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and didn't return: 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6 hours and didn't return: 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours: 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

12 friends ÷ 3 = 4 friends

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Next, the problem tells us that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we multiply her number of friends by 4 to find out how many friends James has:

First, we need to know how far Steve and Tim live from school in feet, because their speeds are given in feet per minute.

- Steve lives 3 miles away. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve lives:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- Tim lives 2 miles away. So, Tim lives:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes each of them to get home.

- Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute. So, the time it takes Steve to get home is:
  \[
  \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

- Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So, the time it takes Tim to get home is:
  \[
  \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many tires each type of bike has:
- A bicycle has 2 tires.
- A tricycle has 3 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire.

Now, let's count how many tires were inflated:
- 5 people on bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires each = 10 tires.
- 3 people on tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires each = 9 tires.
- 1 person on a unicycle, so that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire = 1 tire.

Next, we add up all the tires:
10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, we need to find out how much 20 tires cost:
20 tires * 25 cents per tire = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

1. Dave had a big pack of french fries. He ate 14 of them.
2. Then, a seagull came and ate half as many as Dave, which is 7 fries.
3. After that, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries. So, 3 pigeons times 3 fries each is 9 fries.
4. A raccoon then took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants took one more fry.
6. Finally, there were 5 fries left.

Let's work backwards to find out how many fries Dave started with.

1. **Final Step:**
   - There were 5 fries left after the ants took one.
   - Before the ants took one, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.

2. **Raccoon Step:**
   - The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third.
   - If one-third of the fries is 6, then the total before the raccoon took them was \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. **Pigeons Step:**
   - The pigeons ate 9 fries.
   - Before the pigeons ate, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.

4. **Seagull Step:**
   - The seagull ate 7 fries.
   - Before the seagull ate, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.

5. **Dave Step:**
   - Dave ate 14 fries.
   - Before Dave ate, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, Dave started with 48 fries in the pack.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school!

First, we need to know how many hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long. So, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 days like this in a week, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long. So, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 days like this in a week, he spends:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, let's add up the total hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}

\[ 4 \text{ inches/roll} \times 300 \text{ rolls} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert these inches to feet because the final answer needs to be in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 100 \text{ feet} \]

Now, let's do the same for the chocolate croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill makes 120 croissants every day. So, we multiply 6 inches by 120:
\[ 6 \text{ inches/croissant} \times 120 \text{ croissants} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Again, we convert these inches to feet:
\[ 720 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, for the baguettes. Each baguette is 2 feet long, and Bill makes 60 baguettes every day. So, we multiply 2 feet by 60:
\[ 2 \text{ feet/baguette} \times 60 \text{ baguettes} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add up all the lengths:
\[ 100 \text{ feet (rolls)} + 60 \text{ feet (croissants)} + 120 \text{ feet (baguettes)} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many bananas all the apes eat in one month:
- The monkeys eat 200 bananas.
- The gorillas eat 400 bananas.
- The baboons eat 100 bananas.

So, if we add these up:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Now, the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months. So, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

1400"
"Okay, let's figure out who ran more and by how much.

First, let's look at Blake:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 100 yards there and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- So, Blake runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly:
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards.
- So, for the 40-yard line runs, she covers \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Adding the first run, Kelly runs \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

Now, let's find out how much farther Blake ran:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

So, Blake ran 80 yards farther than Kelly.

80"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Raphael spent on his school supplies.

First, he bought 4 pens. Each pen costs $1.5. So, the total cost for the pens is:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

Next, he bought 2 notebooks. Each notebook costs $4. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

Lastly, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.
2. On Tuesday, the tank gets 7 more feet of water. So, we add 7 feet to the 17 feet from Monday:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together:
- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish

Finally, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: 15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish

So, Anakin and Locsin caught a total of 32 fish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Start with the original price of the marbles:**
   - The marbles cost $20.

2. **Understand how the price changes:**
   - Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price.
   - 20% of $20 is $4 (because 20% is the same as 0.20, and 0.20 * 20 = 4).

3. **Calculate how many times the price increases in 36 months:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so 36 months is 3 years.
   - Every two months, the price goes up, so in 36 months, the price will go up 36 / 2 = 18 times.

4. **Calculate the new price after each increase:**
   - Each time the price goes up, it increases by $4.
   - After 18 increases, the total increase is 18 * $4 = $72.

5. **Add the total increase to the original price:**
   - Original price: $20
   - Total increase: $72
   - New price: $20 + $72 = $92

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $92.

92"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.
   - So, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

So, the total value of all the toys is $50.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Jackie has two choices: she can do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does her taxes herself, she won't be able to do 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 for each hour of freelance work. So, if she does her taxes herself, she will lose:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

If she hires an accountant, the accountant will charge her $90. Now, we need to figure out which option leaves her with more money.

If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105. If she hires the accountant, she pays $90. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she would lose by doing it herself:

$105 - $90 = $15

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Elvira has €1500 to spend on a new computer and some other things. She picked out a computer that costs €1090, which includes a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also chose a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

First, let's add up how much all these things cost:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD Burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

So, the total cost of everything is €1423.

Next, we need to find out how much money Elvira will have left after buying all these items. We do this by subtracting the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many eggs Sandra needs in total. She needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan, and she has to make 15 flans. So, we multiply:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/flan} \times 15 \text{ flans} = 45 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs. So, we divide:
   \[
   45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs/babysitting} = 5 \text{ times}
   \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, then Seth is \( 2B \) years old.
2. In 2 years, Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old, and Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old.
3. The problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write this as:
   \[
   (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
4. Now, let's simplify the equation:
   \[
   2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]
5. Next, we need to solve for \( B \). Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
6. Now, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]
7. So, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:
   \[
   2B = 2 \times 8 = 16

Twice Ethel's money: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)

Now, Jimmy has $2 more than this amount:

Jimmy's money: \( 16 + 2 = 18 \)

So, Jimmy has $18.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. So, for those 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. That's 2 days. So, for those 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekends:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

3. The pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket, and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of the uniform:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many legs all the spiders have together. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, we multiply 80 by 8:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]
So, the spiders have 640 legs in total.

Next, we need to find out how many legs all the insects have together. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, we multiply 90 by 6:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]
So, the insects have 540 legs in total.

Finally, we need to find out how many legs the rare mutant invertebrates have together. There are 3 of these invertebrates, and each has 10 legs. So, we multiply 3 by 10:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
So, the rare mutant invertebrates have 30 legs in total.

Now, we add up all the legs:

2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years

First, we need to add up all the minimum payments Jessica has to make each month:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]

Now, we add this 50% to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica will pay $1500 each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Billy has 60 potatoes to prep. He needs to peel each potato, which takes about 1.5 minutes, and then cut each potato, which takes about 5 seconds.

First, let's find out how long it will take to peel all the potatoes:
- If it takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, then for 60 potatoes, it will take:
  \[
  1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's find out how long it will take to cut all the potatoes:
- If it takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, then for 60 potatoes, it will take:
  \[
  5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
  \[
  300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the time for peeling and cutting together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping all the potatoes.

1. **Cost to make one gallon of lemonade:**
   - Lemons cost $3.
   - Sugar costs $2.
   - So, the total cost for one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Revenue from selling one gallon:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - So, the revenue from one gallon is 20 glasses × $0.50 = $10.

3. **Profit:**
   - They made a total profit of $25.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost.
   - Let's say they made \( G \) gallons of lemonade.
   - The total revenue from \( G \) gallons is \( 10G \) dollars.
   - The total cost for \( G \) gallons is \( 5G \) dollars.
   - So, the profit equation is: \( 10G - 5G = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = 5 \).

5. **Cost of lemons:**
   - They made 5 gallons of lemonade.

So, there are 160 Chinese participants.

Next, we know that 60 of these Chinese participants are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 - 60 = 100

So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent:**
   - Zaid earns $6000 a month.
   - He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   - So, rent = 1/4 of $6000 = $6000 ÷ 4 = $1500.

2. **Next, let's find out how much he spends on car fuel:**
   - He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   - So, car fuel = 1/3 of $6000 = $6000 ÷ 3 = $2000.

3. **Now, let's find out how much money he has left after paying for rent and car fuel:**
   - Total spent on rent and car fuel = $1500 + $2000 = $3500.
   - Money left = $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

4. **Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:**
   - Half of the remaining amount = 1/2 of $2500 = $2500 ÷ 2 = $1250.
   - Money left after donation = $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

5. **Finally, let's subtract the amounts he gives to his daughter and wife:**
   - He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700.
   - Total given to his daughter and wife = $200 + $700 = $900.
   - Money left after all expenses = $1250 - $900 = $350.

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will have $350 left.

\[
\frac{80}{4} = 20
\]

Since the winner got 3 parts, we multiply 20 by 3:
\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

So, the winner got 60 votes. To find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:
\[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. So, if we let the number of white carnations be \( C \), we can write:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]
2. To find \( C \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

3. Next, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered. The problem says she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, if the number of red roses is \( R \), we can write:
   \[
   R = 4C
   \]
4. Since \( C = 40 \), we can substitute 40 for \( C \):
   \[
   R = 4 \times 40 = 160

   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - So, two years ago, Mark was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \) years old.

3. **Mark's Current Age:**
   - If Mark was 19 years old two years ago, then now he is \( 19 + 2 = 21 \) years old.

4. **Jean's Age:**

"Okay, let's think about this race step by step.

First, we have two teams. One team is really good and each of their runners takes exactly 55 seconds to run 400 meters. Since there are four runners, we can calculate the total time for this team by multiplying 55 seconds by 4:

\[ 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's look at the other team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they take 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take 51 seconds. We can add these times together to get the total time for this team:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

### Step 1: Figure out the chance of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers that are greater than 3.

The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
This means there's a 50% chance of rolling a number greater than 3.

### Step 2: Figure out the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers.

The chance of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]
This means there's a 25% chance of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 3: Compare the two probabilities.
We need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find out how much more likely it is, we divide the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]
This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total straw for the hamsters is:
  \[
  10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw in total.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:
\[
50 \text{ pieces (hamsters)} + 20 \text{ pieces (rabbits)} = 70 \text{ pieces}
\]

We know that the total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces. So, the straw given to the rats is:
\[
160 \text{ pieces (total)} - 70 \text{ pieces (hamsters and rabbits)} = 90 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many rats there are in total. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and the rats are divided equally into 3 cages. Let's call the number of rats in each cage \( r \).

The total number of rats is:
\[
3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats per cage} = 3r \text{ rats}
\]

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total straw for the rats is:
\[
3r \text{ rats} \times 6 \text{ pieces per rat} = 18r \text{ pieces}
\]

We already know that the total straw for the rats is 90 pieces, so we can set up the equation:
\[
18r = 90
\]

To find \( r \), we divide both sides by 18:
\[
r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest of 2%. This means every month, the amount Mandy owes increases by 2%.

1. **First Month:**
   - Interest for the first month: \( 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \) dollars
   - Total amount after the first month: \( 100 + 2 = 102 \) dollars

2. **Second Month:**
   - Interest for the second month: \( 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \) dollars
   - Total amount after the second month: \( 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \) dollars

3. **Third Month:**
   - Interest for the third month: \( 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \) dollars
   - Total amount after the third month: \( 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \) dollars

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

106.12"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to move each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The profit for each bag is $30 - $22 = $8.
6. The trader made a total profit of $400.

Now, we need to find out how many bags the trader sold to make $400 in profit. We can set up a simple equation:

\[ \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Total profit} \]

Let's call the number of bags \( x \). So, we have:

\[ x \times 8 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

50"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. That's the cost of the tickets.

Next, they spent $4.50 less on food than they did on the tickets. So, we subtract $4.50 from $20.25 to find out how much they spent on food:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
So, they spent $15.75 on food.

Then, they went on two different rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
So, they spent $66 on the rides.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]
The total cost for everything is $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ 34 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. John collects peaches for 3 hours.
2. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so 3 hours is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.
3. John can collect 2 peaches every minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects \(180 \times 2 = 360\) peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much food one duck needs in a week. The problem says that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week.

Now, if we have 10 ducks, we need to multiply the amount one duck needs by 10:
3.5 pounds/duck/week × 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how much food the ducks need each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Starting Point**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Yearly Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, every year, the number of trees increases by:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. **After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, after all this, Tom has 91 trees left.

\[
\boxed{91}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, we start with the pink flamingos:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos in her yard.

2. **Then, on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took one third of the pink flamingos and painted them white.
   - One third of 18 is 6, so they took 6 pink flamingos and painted them white.
   - After painting, they put these 6 white flamingos back in the yard.
   - So, now there are 12 pink flamingos left (18 - 6) and 6 white flamingos.

3. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the yard.
   - Now, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 (from before) + 18 (new ones) = 30 pink flamingos.
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finally, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6
   - Difference: 30 - 6 = 24

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Okay, so Violetta wants to buy 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2. If we multiply the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon, we get the total cost. That's 5 times 2, which equals $10. Violetta has $20 to spend. If we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the money she has, we find out how much change she will get. So, $20 minus $10 equals $10. 

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much one pen costs. We know that:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together.

So, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means one pen costs $1.50.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We have 200 pounds of carrots, and we need to give 2 pounds of carrots to each of 40 restaurants.

First, we figure out how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together:
- Each restaurant gets 2 pounds.
- There are 40 restaurants.
- So, 2 pounds times 40 restaurants equals 80 pounds of carrots.

Now, we know the total amount of carrots we have is 200 pounds. We need to find out how many pounds are left after giving out 80 pounds to the restaurants:
- 200 pounds minus 80 pounds equals 120 pounds.

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

First, we know the total number of people in Soda is 23,786. Out of these, there are 8,417 men and 9,092 women. To find out how many kids there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

So, we do:
23,786 (total people) - 8,417 (men) - 9,092 (women)

Let's do the math:
23,786 - 8,417 = 15,369
15,369 - 9,092 = 6,277

So, there are 6,277 kids in Soda.

"Okay, let's figure out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. **First, we start with what she had at the beginning:**
   - Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Then, we see how many she collected in the first month:**
   - She collected three times the number she had at the beginning.
   - So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.

3. **Next, we look at how many she collected in the second month:**
   - She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   - So, \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.

4. **Finally, we see how many she collected in the third month:**
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   - The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\).
   - So, \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

5. **Now, we add up all the cards she has:**
   - Initial cards: 20
   - First month: 60
   - Second month: 40
   - Third month: 200

   Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and he splits them equally between two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence. So, for 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A. So, Publisher B pays him 10 cents for each sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
   \[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find out how much he makes in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:

1. **One-time reward:**
   - John gets a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Original weekly salary:**
   - John makes $2000 each week.

3. **Original annual salary:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his original annual salary is $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

4. **5% raise:**
   - A 5% raise on $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

5. **New annual salary:**
   - With the new weekly salary, his new annual salary is $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

6. **Total money made in the year:**
   - Add the one-time reward to the new annual salary.
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

So, John made $114,200 that year."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie gets from her farm each year. She has 10 acres, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. So, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

"Okay, let's figure out how many slices of cheese Carl used.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl had a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - So, for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add it all up:

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal rode his bike in total.

First, for the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each time he rides 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 times 25 kilometers, which is 125 kilometers.
- For four weeks, he rides 125 kilometers times 4, which is 500 kilometers.

Next, for the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each time he rides 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 times 60 kilometers, which is 120 kilometers.
- For three weeks, he rides 120 kilometers times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

Now, to find the total kilometers:
- We add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks.
- That's 500 kilometers plus 360 kilometers, which equals 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Joe's bag of Halloween candy weighs.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars. So, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each one:
\[ 25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ grams per chocolate bar} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs:
\[ 40 \text{ grams} \div 2 = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples. So, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by the weight of each one:
\[ 80 \text{ candied apples} \times 20 \text{ grams per candied apple} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:
\[ 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen is 12 cups:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the cost of each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, we do:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
So, the total cost for the shoes is $40.

Now, we add the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]
So, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the amount she still needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Next, we need to figure out how much more money Sara can earn. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time. So, her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding this to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. So, we divide the amount she needs by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and the shoes.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we know that:
- Red chickens lay 3 eggs each day.
- White chickens lay 5 eggs each day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use \( R \) to represent the number of red chickens and \( W \) to represent the number of white chickens. We know that:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Since \( W = R + 2 \), we can substitute \( R + 2 \) for \( W \) in the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Next, we simplify the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Gary walks. The park is a rectangle, and to walk around it, he covers the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can use this formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

The length of the park is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. So, we plug these numbers into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the distance and speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. By the third day, the total number of customers was 500.

Now, we need to find out how many customers came in on the third day. We can do this by adding the customers from the first two days and then subtracting that total from 500.

First, add the customers from the first two days:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers

Next, subtract this total from 500 to find the number of customers on the third day:
500 - 250 = 250 customers

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."

We have two pools, a big one and a small one. Both pools are leaking at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute. We need to figure out how much water is in the small pool right now.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Right now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations
Let's use \( S \) to represent the amount of water in the small pool right now, and \( B \) to represent the amount of water in the big pool right now.

### Step 3: Write the Equations
1. **4 minutes ago:**
   - The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
   - The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons (because it also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes).
   - According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]

2. **Right now:**
   - The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equations
First, let's substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
\[
2S + 16 = 32
\]
Subtract 16 from both sides:
\[
2S = 16
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 8
\]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Lori needs to buy both the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00, and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Lori has to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Janeth borrowed $2000 and she has to pay back an extra 10% of that amount. To find out how much extra she has to pay, we do:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, Janeth is going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. To find out how much she will pay in total over these 12 months, we do:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out how much she still owes after paying for 12 months, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem also says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if we have 4 roses, we add 7 to find out how many dahlias there are:

4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

15"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, let's see how old they will be in three years:
1. Harriet will be:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]
2. Adrian will be:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Zack will be:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be:
\[
45
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than 34 is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, 17 more than 68 is 85. So, Brianna scored 85 points.
4. Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   - Naomi: 68 points
   - Yuri: 44 points
   - Brianna: 85 points
   - Total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points

5. The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:
   - 251 - 197 = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points. 

54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long Carmen spent on the crossword puzzles. She did 3 crossword puzzles, and each one takes her 10 minutes. So, we multiply 3 by 10:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long she spent on the sudoku puzzles. She did 8 sudoku puzzles, and each one takes her 5 minutes. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time she spent on both types of puzzles to get the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

70"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, the tank starts with 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, we need to figure out how much water is left in the tank after she uses 90 liters.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

So, 30 liters are left in the tank.

Next, Celine collects rainwater. She collects twice as much as what is left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, she collects:

2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the 60 liters of rainwater to the 30 liters that were already in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

90 liters"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know Andy plants 90 geraniums. That's a lot of flowers!

Next, it says he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to find out how many petunias he plants:
90 - 40 = 50 petunias

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
90 + 50 = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers. 

140"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The company spent $15,000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount. So, we need to find out what a third of $15,000 is:

\[ \frac{15,000}{3} = 5,000 \]

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

\[ 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

20000"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Carlos pays for the canoe. The canoe costs $30 per hour, and Carlos uses it for 3 hours. So, we multiply 30 by 3:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.

Next, we need to find out how much Benji pays for the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 per hour, and Benji uses it for 5 hours. So, we multiply 18 by 5:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
Benji pays $90 for the raft.

Now, to find out how much they pay together, we add the amounts Carlos and Benji each pay:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.

180"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to travel by car. The problem says it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. So, if it takes 6 days by bus, it will take 6 divided by 2, which is 3 days, to travel by car.
3. Now, we need to add the time it takes to go to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car. So, 6 days (by bus) + 3 days (by car) = 9 days.

So, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many Pokemon cards James has at the start:
- Fire type: 30 cards
- Grass type: 20 cards
- Water type: 40 cards

So, the total number of cards he has at the start is:
30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards

Now, some changes happen:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so he has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's find out the new total number of cards:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

Next, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. We do this by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \frac{32}{96} \times 100 \]

Let's do the math:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage is:
33%

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Chad has to pay for his burrito.

First, we start with the base price of the burrito, which is $6.50.

Then, we add the extra stuff:
- Extra meat costs $2.00
- Extra cheese costs $1.00
- Avocado costs $1.00
- Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.50 total

Now, let's add the upgrade for chips and a drink, which costs $3.00.

So, we add all these costs together:
$6.50 (base) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (sauces) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00.

9.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Kalinda's Speed:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Mom's Speed:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place 2 pieces per minute.

3. **Combined Speed:**
   - Together, they can place 4 pieces (Kalinda) + 2 pieces (Mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

4. **Total Pieces:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.

5. **Time to Complete:**
   - To find out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined speed.
   - Time = 360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

6. **Convert to Hours:**
   - 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, the farm had 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn went to the farm after two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready to be picked. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. This means there were:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons left on the farm.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. This means there were:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is 21."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school!

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - So, the total cost of the cars is \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   - The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars.
   - To find 10% of 240,000, we multiply 240,000 by 0.10.
   - So, the tax is \( 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration Fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars, so the total registration fees are \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

So, Mark pays a total of 276,000 dollars for everything."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 20 + 5, which is 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times as many shells as she did on Monday. So, she collects 25 * 2, which is 50 shells.

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We start with 36 penguins sunbathing.
2. One-third of them jump into the ocean. So, we need to find one-third of 36:

   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.
3. Another one-third of them go inside the cave to eat dinner. Again, we need to find one-third of 36:
   \[
   \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.
4. Now, we need to find out how many penguins are left sunbathing. We started with 36 penguins, and 12 went to the ocean and 12 went to the cave. So, we subtract the penguins that left from the total:

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes in a week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \(42 \div 2 = 21\) tomatoes in a week.
4. Together, they eat \(42 + 21 = 63\) tomatoes in a week.
5. Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.
6. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce: \(63 \div 3 = 21\).

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know there were 1000 students in the school hall. 

When the meeting ended, 30% of the students left through exit A. To find out how many that is, we do:
1000 students * 30% = 1000 * 0.30 = 300 students

So, 300 students left through exit A. Now, we need to find out how many students are left:
1000 students - 300 students = 700 students

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. To find this, we do:
700 students * 3/5 = 700 * 0.60 = 420 students

So, 420 students left through exit B. Now, we need to find out how many students are left:
700 students - 420 students = 280 students

These 280 students are the ones who left through exit C.

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. John has 54 candies, and we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we divide John's candies by 2:

2. James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, to find out how many candies James has, we add 6 to Robert's candies:
   \[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Find out how many pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - So, he still has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate how many letters Mike receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters each week.

3. **Determine how many pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds to each letter, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate how long it takes Mike to write these pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - So, it takes him \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes to write all the pages.

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

2. **Kyle takes 5 fries.**
   - So, Griffin has \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries left.
3. **Billy takes twice as many as Kyle.**
   - Kyle took 5 fries, so Billy takes \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Now, Griffin has \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries left.
4. **Ginger gives Griffin some fries.**
   - Let's call the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin \( x \).
   - So, Griffin now has \( 9 + x \) fries.
5. **Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took.**
   - Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby takes \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \( 9 + x - 2 \) fries left.
6. **In the end, Griffin has 27 fries.**
   - So, we set up the equation: \( 9 + x - 2 = 27 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
9 + x - 2 = 27

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in math class.

We have two aquariums. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. We need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium, and we know that both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

3. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
5. At the end, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

First, let's find out how much the makeup costs each day:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]
So, it costs $1500 each day.

Next, let's find out how much it costs each week:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]
So, it costs $6000 each week.

Now, let's find out how much it costs for the entire 5 weeks:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]
So, it costs $30,000 for the whole movie.

Finally, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]
So, the discount is $3000.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:

- She spent $4 on invitations.
- She spent $22 on goodie bags.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Next, we need to split this cost evenly among Isabelle and her two parents. That means the cost is divided by 3.

To find out how much each person pays, we divide $96 by 3:

First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much the onions cost. We know that 1 pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300 on onions.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's add up the total cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Her sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Next, we need to find out how many calories each of them consumed. Each cookie has 200 calories.

**Total calories:**
- Sue: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Her sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

**Difference in calories:**
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

5600"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Total Students in the School:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - So, the total number of students is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \).

2. **Total Number of Boys and Girls:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - So, there are \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \) boys and \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \) girls.

3. **Number of Girls in Each Class:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \( 15 + 12 = 27 \).

4. **Number of Girls in the Third Class:**
   - Since there are 30 girls in total and 27 are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is \( 30 - 27 = 3 \).

5. **Number of Boys in the Third Class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - So, the number of boys in the third class is \( 20 - 3 = 17 \).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Last night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars than last night.
     - Last night he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed:
     \[
     15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars}
     \]
   - Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars today.
     - Today he killed 12 cougars, so he killed:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves}
     \]

3. **Total animals killed today:**
   - Wolves: 36
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total today:
     \[
     36 + 12 = 48 \text{ animals}
     \]

4. **Total animals killed over both nights:**
   - Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
   - Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
   - Total:
     \[
     25 + 48 = 73 \text{ animals}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem says he goes up to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

First, we need to find out what 4 times his starting floor is:
4 * 3 = 12

Next, we add 6 to that number:
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

18"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and then subtract that from 30.

30% of 30 is:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know there are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows in all the stalls is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. He wants to put these 40 cows into 20 stalls equally. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows, and with the new cows, each stall has:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank. We need to add up the value of all the coins and dollar bills.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth $0.01, 100 pennies are worth:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth $0.05, 40 nickels are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth $0.10, 20 dimes are worth:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar bills**: Brady has 40 dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1, 40 dollar bills are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tall tree. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
   \[
   200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, to find the total weight of the tree, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
   \[
   20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find out how much weight that is, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:
   \[
   0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Finally, to find the weight of the tree after the termites ate some of it, we subtract the weight of the wood they ate from the total weight:
   \[
   8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood is:

\[
5600 \text{ pounds}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Nancy has 8 books that are overdue, and she owes 50 cents for each one. So, we need to multiply 8 by 50 cents to find out how much she owes just for the overdue books:
8 books * 50 cents/book = 400 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 400 cents is the same as $4.00.

Next, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. We need to add this to the $4.00 she already owes:
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

6.00"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing a math problem in class!

1. First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. The problem says Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if we take away 8 from Andrea's apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has:
   \[
   52 - 8 = 44
   \]
   So, Jamal has 44 apples.

2. Next, the problem tells us that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has by adding 4 to his apples:
   \[
   44 + 4 = 48
   \]
   So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

3. Now, the problem says Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2:
   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]
   So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

4. Finally, we need to find the total number of fruits. We add up all the apples and bananas:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 168

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add those together:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies (a dozen). So, we need to find out how many dozens 66 cookies make:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the cups of flour needed per dozen:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies.

11"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 9,300 pennies in a cup. We need to find out how much money that is if we take two-thirds of those pennies and then convert them to dollars.

First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two-thirds of 9,300. We do this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3:

\[ 9,300 \times 2 = 18,600 \]
\[ 18,600 \div 3 = 6,200 \]

So, two-thirds of 9,300 pennies is 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100:

\[ 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \]

So, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

62 dollars"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box has 50 marbles. So, we need to multiply 5 by 50 to find out how many marbles she has from the boxes. That's 5 times 50, which equals 250 marbles. Then, Maddison gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, we add 20 to the 250 marbles she already has. That's 250 plus 20, which equals 270 marbles.

So, Maddison has 270 marbles now.

270"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Chris has 6 trees in his yard.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. So, Ferdinand has:

3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, Harry has:
   \[
   2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so we add $25 to $100. That means Samantha has $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so we add $50 to $125. That means Daisy has $175.

Now, let's add up all the money they have:
- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

So, $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

The total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Mrs. Cruz has a budget of $400,000 for a house. She found a house that costs $350,000. But there are extra fees she has to pay: a brokerage fee and a transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - So, 5% of $350,000 is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
     \]

2. **Transfer Fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - So, 12% of $350,000 is:
     \[
     0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total cost:
     \[
     350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
     \]

4. **Difference from Budget:**
   - Finally, we need to see how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
     \[
     409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
     \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Mr. Tan has left after selling his house.

1. First, we need to know how much he got from selling the house. That's $400,000.
2. Next, we need to find out how much he paid in transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000. So, we calculate 3% of $400,000:
   \[
   3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]
   So, the transfer fees are $12,000.
3. Then, we need to find out how much he paid in brokerage fees. The brokerage fees are 5% of $400,000. So, we calculate 5% of $400,000:
   \[
   5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]
   So, the brokerage fees are $20,000.
4. Mr. Tan also had to pay off the remaining loan on the house, which was $250,000.
5. Now, we add up all the expenses:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
   \]
   So, the total expenses are $282,000.
6. Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find out how much money Mr. Tan has left:
   \[
   400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

\[
\boxed{118000}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - First, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - So, it takes 8 minutes longer to heat from 300 to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the total time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil.
   - So, the time to cook the chicken is \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken.
   - So, the total time is \( 48 + 43 = 91 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
91 minutes."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the real estate agent spent on the newspaper ads:
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is 50 ads * $5/ad = $250.

Next, we need to find out how much the agent spent on the television ads:
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- Each television ad costs $75.
- So, the total cost for the television ads is 15 ads * $75/ad = $1125.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = $250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

8 golf balls / 2 = 4 blue golf balls

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. So, we add 12 to 300:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
   The second bag has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. So, we divide 300 by 2:
   \[
   300 \div 2 = 150
   \]
   The third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add up all the M&Ms from the three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

2. Next, we add the extra windows in one house.
   - Each house has 4 extra windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house.
   - The total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. That's a lot of stitches!

Next, the collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches. So, we do:
\[ 900 \div 10 = 90 \]
The collar takes 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, we do:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]
The rosette takes 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project. So, the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ 630 \div 2 = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

315"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds.

First, we need to find out how much she spent on the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total amount spent: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **First, the song:**
   - The song has 54 lines. So, Sean needs to memorize 54 lines for the song.

2. **Next, the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song. So, it has \(54 \times 2 = 108\) lines.
   - But only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, Sean has to memorize \(108 \div 3 = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Then, the second scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song. So, it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. So, Sean has to memorize \(60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Finally, add up all the lines:**
   - Lines from the song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48
   - Total lines Sean has to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

First, Carly has 80 cards in total. We need to find out how many of these cards have the letter D on them. Let's break it down:

1. **Cards with A:**
   - 2 out of every 5 cards have the letter A.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \) cards have the letter A.

2. **Remaining cards after A:**
   - We started with 80 cards, and 32 of them have A.
   - So, \( 80 - 32 = 48 \) cards are left.

3. **Cards with B:**
   - Half of the remaining cards have the letter B.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards have the letter B.

4. **Remaining cards after B:**
   - We had 48 cards left, and 24 of them have B.
   - So, \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) cards are left.

5. **Cards with C:**
   - 5 out of every 8 of the remaining cards have the letter C.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \) cards have the letter C.

6. **Remaining cards after C:**
   - We had 24 cards left, and 15 of them have C.
   - So, \( 24 - 15 = 9 \) cards are left.

These 9 cards must have the letter D on them.

So, the number of cards with the letter D is **9**."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole, and he needs to dig 30 of them. So, we multiply 3 minutes by 30:

3 minutes/hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole, and he needs to dig 15 of them. So, we multiply 10 minutes by 15:

10 minutes/hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes together:

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60:

240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Okay, so Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

20 (current total age) + 10 (Mico's extra years) + 10 (Marco's extra years) = 40

So, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 40."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times as old as Sam right now.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( S \) be Sam's age right now.
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's age right now.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information, in 9 years:
- Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \)
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \)

And we know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we need to solve this equation. First, expand the right side:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Now, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to get all the \( S \) terms on one side:
\[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \]
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Next, subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the \( S \) term:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Peter spent on the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles, and each one costs $0.25. So, we multiply 20 by $0.25:
20 * $0.25 = $5.00

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 4 by $0.50:
4 * $0.50 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter spent:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. The problem says that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, if we divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2, we can find out how many spots a mamba has:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras and mambas have together. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots of the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

The problem asks for half the number of spots they all have combined. So, we divide the total number of spots by 2:

\[ 4900 \div 2 = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

2450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many people are coming to the soccer game. We have:
- 12 team members
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests
- 3 coaches

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas we need. Each pizza serves 3 people, so:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \]
We need 13 pizzas.

Now, each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza."

1. **First, we need to know how much space the topaz gemstones take up:**
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

2. **Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The topaz gemstones take up 8 inches.
   - So, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining space:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, which is \(0.25\) inches.
   - To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25:
     \[
     \frac{17}{0.25} = 68
     \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each wrote double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Okay, so if Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice her age, which means he's 18 years old right now. If we want to know how old he'll be in 3 years, we just add 3 to 18. So, he'll be 21 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth 5 * 25 = 125 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add these together to find out how much money Kelly has in total:
125 cents (from the quarters) + 20 cents (from the dimes) = 145 cents.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

So, after buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many stars are in the rows that have 8 stars and 6 stars.

- There are 3 rows with 8 stars each. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- There are 2 rows with 6 stars each. So, \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in these rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\] stars.

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars we already counted from the total:
\[76 - 36 = 40\] stars.

Each 5-star row has 5 stars. To find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\] rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

Next, we need to see how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the number of trucks needed is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles per hour.

Now, the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. We need to find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance.

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

1. **First, we need to find out how many medals Izzy has.**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - So, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together.**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Now, we need to figure out how many medals have been given out for counting.**
   - Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. We know there are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, we multiply:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
So, the adults get 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]
So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
2. But she takes a half-hour break, so she only works for 2.5 hours.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours is 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes. That's 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.
5. If she earns $5 for each interval, then she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has more than 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has more than 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the activities he did over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we add all these together:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is 370."

First, we need to know how much rice each person eats in one meal. The problem says each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.

Next, we need to find out how much rice the whole family eats in one meal. There are 5 people in the family, so:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Now, the family eats rice twice a day, at lunch and dinner. So, we need to find out how much rice they eat in one day:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Then, we need to find out how much rice they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Finally, we have a 42 kg bag of rice. We need to find out how many weeks this bag will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount they eat in one week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add up all the crates he sold:
15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) + 20 (Weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, and he sold 65 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

1. **Distance to Work:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away.
   - He goes there and back each day, so that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Distance:**
   - He goes to work 5 days a week.
   - So, 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

3. **Annual Distance:**
   - He works 50 weeks a year.
   - So, 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He gets charged $2 per mile.
   - So, 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for the miles driven.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives his driver a $150 bonus each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

   - So, the number of books sold so far is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

2. **Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year.
   - So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total books sold over the three years is 200.
   - Books sold in the first year = 90 books.
   - Books sold in the current year = 45 books.

1. **Find out how many days Watson worked in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4 weeks in a month, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) days. But since April has 30 days, it's a bit more than 4 weeks. So, Watson works 21 days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, for 21 days, he works \(21 \times 10 = 210\) hours.

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Next, we need to figure out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

So, 20 loaves are left after the morning.

Now, half of these remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. First, we find half of the remaining 20 loaves:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

\[ 8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to see how many 2-pound losses fit into 8 pounds. We do this by dividing 8 pounds by 2 pounds per 4 weeks:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]
Since each 2-pound loss takes 4 weeks, we multiply 4 by 4:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Helena's serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We need to find out how many new limbs a person will have after 15 days.

First, let's figure out how many new arms the person will grow:
- Every 3 days, the person grows 1 new arm.
- In 15 days, the person will grow \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) new arms.

Next, let's figure out how many new legs the person will grow:
- Every 5 days, the person grows 1 new leg.
- In 15 days, the person will grow \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) new legs.

Now, we add the number of new arms and new legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs.

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how much Theo spends on the business suits:
- He buys 6 suits, and each suit costs $100.
- So, 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- He buys 3 suitcases, and each suitcase costs $50.
- So, 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 * $100 = $500.
- Adding $700 to $500 gives us $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up all the expenses so far:
- Suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200
- Total expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, out of his $6000, he plans to spend:
- $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has left to spend on gifts, we subtract his total expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
- $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many eggs each group of people eats every day:
- There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- There are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we add the eggs eaten by both groups to find the total number of eggs eaten each day:
- \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs are eaten in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
- \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will eat 91 eggs in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Cera's Age:**
   - Cera is 46 years old now.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population was half of what it is now.
   - If the population six years ago was 60,000, then the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the current population of Chile is 120,000."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We know that:
- The total number of players on the football team is 105.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's use a letter to represent the number of players on the defense. We'll use \( D \).

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice the number of players on the defense).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of players:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Let's combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier to solve, we can get rid of the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2 \times 3D + 2 \times \frac{D}{2} = 2 \times 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited to her party:
- She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to figure out how many people couldn't come:
- 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
- 1/4 of the number of sick people had other commitments. So, \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people had other commitments.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
- Total people who showed up: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, 14 people showed up for Martha's party."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in his store.
3. His dad gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, we need to find out how many marbles that is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
\[
20 \text{ (from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (initially in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his dad)} = 78 \text{ marbles}
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of all the marbles is:
\[
78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
156 kg"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much space the pool takes up. We do this by finding the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to fill the pool. We know it costs $0.1 for each cubic foot of water. So, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

3. The problem also says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, if there are 30 boys, then there are:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \text{ nongendered children}
   \]
4. Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

The problem says that for every electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. This is like saying if you have 1 pole, you need 3 wires. 

Now, we know that there are 45 electric wires in total. We need to find out how many poles are needed.

To do this, we can set up a simple equation. If 1 pole needs 3 wires, then the number of poles (let's call it \( P \)) times 3 should equal the total number of wires, which is 45.

So, we write it like this:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

1. **First, we need to know how many people were at the party at the start:**
   - There were 25 men and 15 women.
   - So, the total number of people was 25 + 15 = 40.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how many people left after an hour:**
   - The problem says that 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 is 40 ÷ 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Now, we need to find out how many people are left at the party:**
   - If 10 people left, then 40 - 10 = 30 people are still at the party.

4. **We know that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - So, out of the 30 people who are still there, 22 are men.

5. **To find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of men from the total number of people still at the party:**
   - 30 people - 22 men = 8 women.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 extra pencils, and all together, she has 26 pencils. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. 

If we take away the 2 extra pencils, we have:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, the 24 pencils are in the three boxes. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we divide 24 by 3:
\[ 24 \div 3 = 8 \]

So, each box has 8 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, knowing that each box holds 8 pencils. We divide 72 by 8:
\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

Shannon makes iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker.

First, we need to figure out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
- Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
- So, to cool it by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
  \[
  65 \div 13 = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much weaker the coffee gets from these ice cubes:
- Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
- So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
  \[
  5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
  \]

Now, we add the 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes the coffee weaker:
- So, the total amount the coffee is weakened is:
  \[
  60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

1. **Find out how many junior programmers there are:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - Junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total employees.
   - So, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Find out how many senior programmers there are:**
   - If there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers, then the rest must be senior programmers.
   - So, the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer earns $2000 per month.
   - So, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

4. **Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer earns $400 more than a junior programmer.
   - So, each senior programmer earns \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) per month.
   - The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \).

5. **Find the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   - Add the total monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers.

- At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on.
- By the time the bus got to the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus.

Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal ""x.""

1. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
2. After the second stop, 7 people got off, so we subtract 7: \( (x + 5) - 7 \).
3. Then, 8 more people got on, so we add 8: \( (x + 5 - 7) + 8 \).

Now, let's simplify that:
\[ (x + 5 - 7) + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that by the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

- The state takes 20% of his pay in taxes.
- So, the tax he pays is \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars.
- After paying taxes, he has \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars left.

**Job B:**
- Nick gets paid $42,000 a year.
- He has to pay $6,000 in property tax.
- So, after property tax, he has \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars left.
- The state takes 10% of what's left in taxes.
- So, the tax he pays is \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars.
- After paying taxes, he has \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars left.

- He pays $1,350 right away.
- Then, he pays $350 every month for 6 months.
- So, the total for the monthly payments is $350 times 6, which is $2,100.
- Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

For Cozy Homes:
- He pays $1,100 right away.
- Then, he pays $250 every month for 9 months.

Now, Maria has 8 shares, each worth $12, so the total value of her shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price goes down by 25%. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

We have 200 students in total, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups \( x \). The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students, will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of students:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). First, add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than 70, which means:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and these are either chickens or cows.
2. He has twice as many chickens as cows. So, if we say the number of cows is \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is the sum of the cows and the chickens:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. To find the number of cows, we divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. So, there are 20 cows. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, let's count the legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:
  \[
  20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ legs}
  \]

Adding the legs together:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. 

160"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Josh starts with 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. After 4 weeks, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.
4. On stage, he drops 3 balls.
5. 2 of the dropped balls are caught and returned to him.
6. 1 ball is lost completely.

So, after all this, Josh has 7 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 5 balls left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, she got twice as many new baby outfits as her friend gave her. So, that's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) baby outfits.
3. Her mom gave her 15 more baby outfits.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more meters each day. To find out how much more, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
   \]
3. So, Tyson needs to run an extra 1000 meters each day. Adding this to his original distance:
   \[
   5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters}
   \]
4. June has 30 days. To find out how many meters Tyson runs in June, we multiply his new daily distance by 30:
   \[
   6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000 meters"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Next, Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, if we add 5 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A, we get:
4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars for Juice Box B.

Now, Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, if we add 7 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A, we get:
4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars for Juice Box C.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many legs are on the 40 tables that each have 4 legs. We do this by multiplying the number of tables by the number of legs each table has:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many legs are on the 50 tables that each have 3 legs. We do this by multiplying the number of tables by the number of legs each table has:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the two results together to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Total cookies in the bag**: Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.
2. **Cookies for her son**: She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. So, 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.
3. **Cookies for her husband**: Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. So, 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies eaten by her son and her husband:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies

Finally, we subtract the total cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much the shirts cost without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts. So, we multiply the cost of one shirt by the number of shirts:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]
So, the total cost without the discount is $60.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 40%, which means Davos gets to save 40% of the total cost. To find 40% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.40 (since 40% is the same as 0.40):
\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]
So, the discount amount is $24.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos actually paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **First, let's find out how much money the factory used to make each day when they made tractors:**
   - They sold 10 tractors a day.
   - Each tractor was sold for $100.
   - So, the total money they made each day from tractors is \( 10 \times 100 = 1000 \) dollars.

2. **Next, let's find out how much money the factory makes each day now that they make silos:**
   - They sell 5 silos a day.
   - Each silo is sold for $220.
   - So, the total money they make each day from silos is \( 5 \times 220 = 1100 \) dollars.

3. **Now, let's find out how much more money they make each day now compared to when they made tractors:**
   - The difference in daily earnings is \( 1100 - 1000 = 100 \) dollars.

4. **Finally, let's find out what percentage this increase is of the original daily earnings:**
   - The percentage increase is calculated by dividing the increase by the original amount and then multiplying by 100.
   - So, the percentage increase is \( \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \).

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

  25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Treats cost $20 per month.

- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up all the monthly costs:
\[
100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[
220 \times 12 = 2640 \text{ dollars per year}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Monday's Yoga Class**: It's 1 hour long.
2. **Tuesday's Cooking Class**: This is 3 times as long as the yoga class, so it's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's Cheese-Tasting Event**: This is just 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.
4. **Thursday's Museum Tour**: This is half as long as the cooking class, so it's \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's Errands**: These take 2 hours.

Now, let's add all these times together:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours

2. Next, we add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find out the total number of plant pots the school needs:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots}
   \]

3. April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots the school needs from the number of plant pots April bought:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we know John spent 6 hours boating. He also spent half that time swimming, so:
\[ \text{Time spent swimming} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. So:
\[ \text{Time spent watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time he spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time on activities} = 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

The problem says that these 15 hours are 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. We can set up an equation to find the total time \( T \):
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours. The problem also says he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, we calculate the time spent sightseeing:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

Next, he bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add up the total cost of the toys:
$12 (for the cars) + $5 (for the teddy bears) = $17

Dean started with $28, and he spent $17 on toys. So, the money he has left is:
$28 - $17 = $11

Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can do a few things:
- Play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
- Have $5 in arcade tokens.
- Ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 per ride.

First, let's add up how much it costs for one person to do all these things:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20

So, the total cost for one person is:
$5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, Morgan has $90 to spend. We need to see how many people can be included in this budget:
$90 ÷ $30 = 3

This means Morgan can have 3 people in total, including herself. So, the number of friends she can invite is:
3 - 1 = 2

Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. 

First, we need to find out how much she spends on lollipops each day:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents
100 cents is the same as $1.00.

So, Marisa spends $1.00 on lollipops each day.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying the lollipops:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

This means Marisa saves $4.00 each day.

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days:

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Billy starts with $10. He buys some candy that costs $1.50 per pound. After buying the candy, he has some money left over. He then spends half of this leftover money on gumballs, which cost 5 cents each. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Each gumball costs 5 cents, so 40 gumballs cost:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his leftover money on gumballs, the total amount of leftover money he had before buying gumballs was:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Billy started with $10 and had $4 left after buying the candy. So, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The candy costs $1.50 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Carver just turned 45 years old, and that makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We need to figure out how old his son is.

First, let's set up the problem with a simple equation. If we let \( x \) be the age of Carver's son, then:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). 

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
   \[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, we need to find out how far the train travels in one complete trip:**
   - From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
   - From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
   - From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs.
   
   The combined distance of the first two legs is:
   \[
   75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]
   So, the distance from the third city back to the first city is:
   \[
   175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:**
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Next, we need to find out how far the train travels in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips each day.
   - So, the total distance traveled in one day is:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

4. **Finally, we need to figure out how many days the train can go before it needs service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled in one day:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}

First, we need to know how much stuffing goes into a collie bed. A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds. The collie bed needs the average of these two amounts. 

To find the average, we add the two amounts together and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to drive 210 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took John to drive back home. The route home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 miles per hour. Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. That's easy to remember.

Next, the problem says that the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So, we do the math:

So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we add up all the people who were kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 \text{ (masks)} + 7 \text{ (shoplifting)} + 21 \text{ (physical violence)} = 31 \]

The problem says that a total of 50 people were kicked out. So, to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the reasons we know from the total:

4. This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
5. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total of 24 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much the picture frames cost. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, we multiply 44 by 20:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \]
So, the picture frames cost $880.

Next, each frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost. To find 20% of $20, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]
So, the etching adds $4 to each frame. For 44 frames, the total etching cost is:
\[ 44 \times 4 = 176 \]
So, the etching costs $176.

Now, 2 of the seniors will also receive pins. Each pin costs $5, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
So, the pins cost $10.

Finally, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords. First, we find out how many seniors are officers:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]
Each cord costs $12, so:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]
So, the cords cost $132.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
1198"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Ethan saves by making the wallpaper himself. The wallpaper costs $400 at the market, and he saves 20% by making it himself.

To find 20% of $400, we do:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs him to make the wallpaper. We subtract the savings from the market price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. But, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, the store actually sold \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

So, the store sold 100 tennis shoes by the end of the sale.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

On Tuesdays, Hallie practices for 1 hour.
On Thursdays, she practices for 2 hours.
On Saturdays, she practices for twice as long as on Tuesdays, so that's 2 hours (because 1 hour on Tuesday times 2).

Now, let's add it all up:
1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie practices for 5 hours each week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. The company bought equipment worth $400,000.
2. Some of the equipment was faulty. We need to find out how much of the equipment was faulty.
3. The problem says 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply 400,000 by 0.40 (which is the same as 40%).

So, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 400,000 \times 0.40 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty equipment was worth $160,000.

4. Now, we need to find out how much the company spent on the equipment that was not faulty. We do this by subtracting the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment.

So, we subtract:
\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

Therefore, the company spent $240,000 on the functioning pieces of equipment.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. So, from these 15 sheep, she gets:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk

The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day. So, from these 15 sheep, she gets:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk

Now, to find out how much milk she collects every day, we add the milk from both groups:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

45 kg"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so that's 6 rolls gone. Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. She then breaks each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces and feeds them to the chickens. So, the number of pieces she feeds to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. First, we know there are 40 kids in the class.
2. Half of the class likes blue. So, we need to find half of 40:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 kids like blue.
3. Now, we need to find out how many kids are left after the ones who like blue:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 kids are left.
4. One-fourth of these remaining kids like green. So, we need to find one-fourth of 20:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 kids like green.
5. Finally, we need to find out how many kids like yellow. We subtract the number of kids who like blue and green from the total number of kids:
   \[
   40 - 20 - 5 = 15

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. We know she made $56 by selling apples at $4 each. So, we divide the total money by the price per apple:
\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \]
So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

Next, on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. That's easy to remember.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, we multiply the number of apples from Tuesday by 2:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]
So, Lucy picked 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, we add up all the apples she picked over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

"Okay, let's think about this. Lindsay has 50 socks to wash. She washes 10 pairs of socks. Since a pair is two socks, that means she washes 10 times 2, which is 20 socks. She also washes 15 loose socks. So, in total, she washes 20 socks from the pairs plus 15 loose socks, which adds up to 35 socks. If she started with 50 socks and washed 35, then she must have missed 50 minus 35, which is 15 socks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much interest Karan will pay on the $3,650 she borrowed. The interest rate is 10%, and she borrowed the money for 5 months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   - The interest rate is 10%, which is 0.10 as a decimal.
   - Since 5 months is 5/12 of a year, we use 5/12 in our calculation.
   - The formula for interest is: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
   - So, Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12)

   Let's do the math:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   - The total amount is the principal plus the interest.
   - Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.50
   - Total Amount = $3,802.50

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   - Karan has to pay this total amount over 5 months.
   - Monthly Payment = Total Amount ÷ Number of Months
   - Monthly Payment = $3,802.50 ÷ 5
   - Monthly Payment = $760.50

So, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

First, we need to know how many silver and gold pesos Axel has:
- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos.

Now, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has:
- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. So, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. So, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we add up all the pesos they have together:
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Finally, we add the total silver and gold pesos to get the total number of pesos:
- Total pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:

1. **Find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make:**
   - Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - So, 3 pitchers × 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

2. **Calculate how much money Millie makes from selling all the lemonade:**
   - She sells each cup for $1.
   - So, 36 cups × $1 per cup = $36.

3. **Find out how much profit Millie makes after paying for the supplies:**
   - The supplies cost $18.
   - So, $36 (total money made) - $18 (cost of supplies) = $18 profit.

4. **Determine how long it takes to sell all the lemonade:**
   - Millie sells 4 cups per hour.
   - So, 36 cups ÷ 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

5. **Calculate the profit per hour:**
   - Millie makes $18 profit in 9 hours.
   - So, $18 ÷ 9 hours = $2 per hour.

So, Millie makes **$2** profit per hour."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. We need to find out how much land he had at first.

1. If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left, that means he has 2/5 of his land left (because he sold 3/5, so 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

2. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times \text{total land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
   \]

3. To find the total land, we need to solve for the total land. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:
   \[
   \text{total land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]

4. Now, let's do the multiplication:
   \[
   12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32

The performance is only with the girls, so we start with 26 girls.

But on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, only half of 26 girls can perform:

26 ÷ 2 = 13 girls

Then, the 3 teachers decide to join the performance. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we know that the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

Next, we know that together they have 165 popsicles. To figure out how many popsicles each person has, we need to add the parts of the ratio together:
- 5 parts for Betty
- 6 parts for Sam
- Total parts = 5 + 6 = 11

Now, we need to find out how many popsicles each part represents. We do this by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

So, each part of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

3. **Hulu and Disney+ Cost:**
   - Each costs $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
   - But Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling them.
   - To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - So, the discount is $4.
   - The total cost for Hulu and Disney+ after the discount is:

So, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars a month by cancelling his cable and getting the streaming services."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how long Carol spent on each part of her work:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of 4 hours, which is 2 hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. Next, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. Let's use minutes:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
   - Recording the song: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

3. Now, let's add up all the time she spent:
   - Total time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing)
   - Total time = 450 minutes

4. To find out what percentage of her total time she spent editing, we use this formula:
   - Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
   - Percentage = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100
   - Percentage = 0.2 * 100
   - Percentage = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

2. **Milk:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

3. **Bags of Flour:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
   - Mark needs 12 cups of flour, so he needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

4. **Bottles of Milk:**
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
   - Mark needs 4 cups of milk, so he needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

5. **Difference:**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
   - The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of power.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - So, the total energy used in one day is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the energy used after reducing the time:**
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - So, the new energy used in one day is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Find out how much energy is saved each day:**
   - The energy saved each day is the difference between the original usage and the new usage:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. **Convert the daily savings to kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total savings over 30 days:**
   - The total energy saved over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

135"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many stripes all the zebras have together. We have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many zebras there are in total:
\[ 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ 88 \div 4 = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **How many sandwiches do we need?**
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, we need 20 ÷ 4 = 5 sandwiches.

2. **How much meat and cheese do we need?**
   - Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

3. **How much does the meat cost?**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - So, 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 × $7.00 = $35.00.

4. **How much does the cheese cost?**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - So, 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 × $3.00 = $15.00.

5. **What is the total cost?**
   - The total cost is the cost of the meat plus the cost of the cheese.
   - Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know that Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. The problem says that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. So, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]
3. Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]
4. Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]
5. Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has. We add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already did half of that walking to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then, he went for a short walk with his friend and did 1,000 more steps. So far, he has done:

5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he still had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. So, the total steps he had taken before and during his jog plus the 2,000 steps left should add up to 10,000.

Let's find out how many steps he took during his jog:

6,000 (steps before the jog) + steps during jog + 2,000 (steps left) = 10,000

Now, we can solve for the steps during the jog:

6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during jog = 10,000
steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000
steps during jog = 2,000

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

1. First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book has 45 pages, and each page has 200 words. So, we multiply:
   \[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
   \[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, but it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
   \[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

4. Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he will have left before he needs to leave for the airport:
   \[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much the company paid to the employees in May. 

- There were 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- They were paid $15 per hour.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 40 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's figure out how much the company paid in June.

- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees stayed.
- 3/4 of 40 employees is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

The total pay for one employee in June is the same as in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, for all 30 employees:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Sally buys 2 pounds of taffy. The taffy is on sale, so the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $1.50. So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, Sally buys a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she buys 4 magnets, and each magnet costs $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400. Then, he buys another pack that costs twice as much as the first one. So, the second pack costs:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of both packages together:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate:
\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packages:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. We add this to the discounted total:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

First, we need to find out how many cookies she will eat in 30 days:
2 cookies/night × 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we need to figure out how many dozens of cookies that is. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:
60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Marcy makes 50,000 candles. She says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them might explode. 

To find out how many candles might explode, we calculate 1% of 50,000:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \]
So, 500 candles might explode.

Next, we know that 5% of the candles that might explode also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 

To find out how many of the 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog, we calculate 5% of 500:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much each blouse costs after the discount. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount.
2. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by 30% (or 0.30):
   \[
   20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]
   So, the discount is $6.

3. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:
   \[
   20 - 6 = 14

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Joanne picks 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She picks half that amount from the shortest trees, so that's 15 apples.
3. We don't know how many apples she picks from the average trees, so let's call that number \( x \).

Now, her sister:
1. Picks twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Picks three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so that's \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Doesn't pick any apples from the average trees, so that's 0 apples.

Together, they picked a total of 500 apples. So, we can write an equation to find out how many apples Joanne picked from the average trees:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the numbers we know:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We have a herd of camels and dromedaries. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. We know there are 180 heads (which means 180 animals in total) and 304 humps.

First, let's set up our equations. We'll use \( C \) for the number of camels and \( D \) for the number of dromedaries.

1. The total number of animals (heads):
\[ C + D = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

Now, let's solve these equations. We can start by solving the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]

Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( C \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"Okay, let's figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week trip in Europe.

First, we need to break down the trip into parts:

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 4 days, he traveled: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers is: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - So, for 7 days, he traveled: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

   So, the comb is now at 6,000 feet.

3. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the 20 cats that were taken by the boats from the 50 cats that were originally there:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill pays for the streaming service over 2 years.

First, for the first 6 months, Bill pays $8 each month. So, we do:

Next, for the next 8 months, the price goes up to $12 each month. So, we do:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]
That's $96 for the next 8 months.

Finally, for the last 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the price is $14 each month. So, we do:
\[ 10 \times 14 = 140 \]
That's $140 for the last 10 months.

1. **Find the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - So, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Find the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - So, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - So, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

4. **Find the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

First, we need to know how many employees each type of vehicle can carry:

- **Buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees. There are 4 buses.
  - So, 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

- **Minibusses**: Each minibus can hold 30 employees. There are 6 minibusses.
  - So, 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

- **Minivans**: Each minivan can hold 15 employees. There are 10 minivans.
  - So, 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the employees that can be carried by the buses, minibusses, and minivans:

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds. But the homemade ones are more popular and attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.

First, let's find out how many birds the store-bought feeders attract:
- 3 store-bought feeders × 20 birds each = 60 birds

Next, let's find out how many birds the homemade feeders attract:
- 3 homemade feeders × 30 birds each = 90 birds

Now, we add the birds from both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
- 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and he has $50 left over for spending money. So, he must have made $150 from selling his Pokemon cards.

He sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per card:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = 100 \]

To solve for the total number of cards, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

\[ \text{Total cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

   - Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each.
   - 18 guests getting 2 hotdogs each means \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, so \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Now, let's see what happened when 40 guests showed up:**
   - Each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
   - So, they needed \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs in total.

3. **Find out how many hotdogs were missing:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - They needed 80 hotdogs, so they were short by \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

4. **Determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, and there were 26 hotdogs missing, 26 guests did not get their second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

26"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem says her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. So, we first find half of 6:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 to this number to get the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

13"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items Charlotte wants to buy:
- The pots and pans cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, the store is giving a 20% discount on everything. To find out how much the discount is, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

So, the discount is $33.00. We subtract this discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up the cost of all the things Dora wants to buy:
- The skipping rope costs $6.
- The board game costs $11.
- The playground ball costs $2.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mom gave her $16.

So, the total amount of money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy everything. We do this by subtracting the total amount of money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. That's a lot!
2. Prince Arthur killed three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find out how many, we do:
   \[
   100 \times \frac{3}{4} = 75
   \]
   So, Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. To find out how many, we do:
   \[
   75 \times 2 = 150
   \]
   So, Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find out how many, we do:
   \[
   150 \times \frac{1}{5} = 30
   \]
   So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[
   15 \div 5 = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Next, Josey needs 1/4 of a container. So, we need to find out how much 1/4 of 3 gallons is:
   \[
   3 \div 4 = 0.75 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8:
   \[
   0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Total Money George Had:**
   - George started with $5.

2. **Money Left:**
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left.
   - 1% of $5 is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars.
   - So, he had $0.05 left.

3. **Money Spent:**
   - If he had $0.05 left, he must have spent \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of Chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

5. **Money Spent on Candy Bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

6. **Number of Candy Bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Okay, so Ray had 25 lollipops. He decided to keep 5 for himself, which means he shared the rest. To find out how many he shared, we do 25 minus 5, which equals 20 lollipops. These 20 lollipops were then shared equally among his four friends. To find out how many each friend got, we divide 20 by 4, which gives us 5. So, each of Ray's friends got 5 lollipops.

5"
"Okay, so Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces. If each piece is the same size, then each piece would weigh 20 divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces. Rory and her mom each eat one piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. Two pieces at 2.5 ounces each would be 5 ounces. So, if the whole cake was 20 ounces and they ate 5 ounces, the remaining cake would weigh 20 minus 5, which is 15 ounces.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so he uses \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
   - Onions cost $2.00 per pound.
   - So, the cost for 4 pounds of onions is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Beef Stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - So, the cost for 2 boxes of beef stock is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the onions and beef stock is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Cost per Serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Wayne's Drive Time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

2. **Bernadette's Drive Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's.
   - So, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - So, Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Wayne's Departure Time:**
   - Wayne leaves 4 minutes before \( T \), so he leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes.

6. **Difference in Departure Times:**
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long the room is in feet. The problem says the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet per yard:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we know the length of the room is 9 feet. The area of the room is 360 square feet. To find the width, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

To find the width, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now we know the width of the room is 40 feet. To find the perimeter, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."

First, we need to find out how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Elizabeth's total beads = 1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's find out how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack has 20 beads.
- So, Margareth's total beads = 3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has compared to Elizabeth:
- Difference = Margareth's total beads - Elizabeth's total beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, when Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. That's our starting point.

Then, Marcus bakes for 3 hours. Every hour, the oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer. So, we need to figure out how much warmer the house gets after 3 hours of baking.

3 hours * 5 degrees per hour = 15 degrees

So, after baking, the house is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. We need to find out how much the house cools down in 30 minutes.

30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So, the house cools down by 6 degrees.

Finally, we subtract the cooling from the temperature after baking to find the final temperature.

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how long it took Jon to finish the triathlon. We add up the times for each part:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's figure out how long it took James for each part:

1. **Swim:**
   - Jon took 40 minutes.
   - James is 10% faster, so he took 10% less time.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is \( 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \) minutes.
   - So, James took \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) minutes for the swim.

2. **Bike:**
   - Jon took 80 minutes.
   - James took 5 minutes longer.
   - So, James took \( 80 + 5 = 85 \) minutes for the bike.

3. **Run:**
   - We need to find out how long James took to run.
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes longer than Jon's total time.
   - Jon's total time was 170 minutes, so James took \( 170 + 10 = 180 \) minutes in total.

Now, we know James' total time and the time he took for the swim and bike. We can find the time he took for the run by subtracting the swim and bike times from his total time:

\[ 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. 

The answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long Movie C is. The problem says Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many minutes 1.25 hours is by multiplying:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, the problem tells us that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, the problem says that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ 80 \div 4 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance like this:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles per hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much hay the horse will eat. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we need to find out how much 8 bails of hay cost. Each bail costs $3:

\[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bill} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael will have after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Michael will have 6 dollars left after buying the hay.

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's total points from Joey's total points:
240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

1. **Find out how much the salesman paid for all the sneakers:**
   - The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.
   - So, the cost of all the sneakers is $576.

2. **Calculate how much money he made from the flash sale:**
   - He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
   - To find the total money from the flash sale, we multiply the number of sneakers by the price:
     \[
     17 \times 20 = 340
     \]
   - So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

3. **Find out how many sneakers were left after the flash sale:**
   - He started with 48 sneakers and sold 17.
   - To find the number of sneakers left, we subtract:
     \[
     48 - 17 = 31
     \]
   - So, he had 31 sneakers left.

4. **Calculate how much money he made from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store:**
   - He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each.
   - To find the total money from the department store, we multiply the number of sneakers by the price:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra.
   - So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let's call the cost of the popcorn \( P \).

   So, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + $3 + \( P \).

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.

   So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   12 + 3 + P = 21 - 2
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the right side: \( 21 - 2 = 19 \).
   - Now the equation is: \( 12 + 3 + P = 19 \).
   - Combine the numbers on the left side: \( 15 + P = 19 \).
   - Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( P \): \( P = 19 - 15 \).
   - So, \( P = 4 \).

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price went up. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide 900 by 20:

900 \div 20 = 45
\]

So, each balloon originally cost $45 to fill.

Next, the price of each balloon went up by $20. So, the new price for each balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new price by 170:

"Okay, let's figure out the average speed of the car during the trip. 

First, we need to find out how far the car traveled in total. 

- For the first part of the trip, the car went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance is:
  \[
  60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car went 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance is:
  \[
  30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we add these distances together to get the total distance:
\[
120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total time the car was driving:
\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires at the start is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies she gets is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has:
- 5 sapphires left (because she started with 8 and traded 3)
- 2 rubies

Now, let's calculate the total value of her remaining jewels:
- The value of the 5 sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]
- The value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, we divide the total cubic feet by the amount each bag holds:

\[ 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \div 2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so we need to find out the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:

1920"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Red Cards**: We know there are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: It says there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - So, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. That's our starting number.

Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did. Half of 50 is 25. So, 25 more fairies joined the 50 that were already there. 

Now, we add the 50 fairies and the 25 new fairies together:
50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

After a little while, 30 fairies flew away. So, we need to subtract 30 from the 75 fairies that were there:
75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

45"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many puppies there are in total. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, we add these together:

\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, we add these together too:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we want to find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots. To do this, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots. 

35%"
"Okay, let's figure out how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed for his horses.

First, let's add up the weight of all the different types of feed:

- **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound each = 2 pounds
- **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds each = 48 pounds
- **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds each = 3150 pounds
- **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds each = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add all these weights together to get the total weight of the feed:

\[
2 \text{ pounds} + 48 \text{ pounds} + 3150 \text{ pounds} + 1300 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much money Grayson makes from the cans and bottles each week.

1. **Cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda each week.
   - Each can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, the money from cans each week is 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. **Bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 bottles of water each week.
   - Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, the money from bottles each week is 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the money from cans and bottles to find out how much Grayson makes each week:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Next, we need to find out how much Grayson makes in a four-week month:
- Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 

To find 60% of 10, we do:
\[ 10 \times 0.60 = 6 \]

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we know Toni has 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from Toni's 16 plants:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the basketball cards and the baseball cards to find the total number of cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

She gives the remaining 300 cards to her students, and each student gets 10 cards. To find out how many students she has, we divide:
\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's see how much Becky paid:
- Becky bought 20 apples, and each apple costs 45 cents.
- So, the total cost for Becky before any discount is \(20 \times 45\) cents, which is \(900\) cents or \(9\) dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's see how much Kelly paid:
- Kelly also bought 20 apples, but each apple costs 50 cents.
- So, the total cost for Kelly before any discount is \(20 \times 50\) cents, which is \(1000\) cents or \(10\) dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount, so she saved \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- After the discount, Kelly paid \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how many of each thing are in one room:
- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets × 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 pillow cases × 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the things in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, in one room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

Since there are 80 rooms, we need to multiply the number of pieces in one room by 80:
- 15 pieces/room × 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200.

1. **Start with the shoes Fireman Frank has:**
   - He has 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes he gets on Monday:**
   - He gets 5 pairs of shoes.
   - 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
   - So, now he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

3. **Shoes he gets on Wednesday:**
   - He gets 15 pairs of shoes.
   - 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
   - So, now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

4. **Shoes he gets on Friday:**
   - He gets 30 pairs of shoes.
   - 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
   - So, now he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

5. **Shoes he gets rid of on Saturday:**
   - He gets rid of 180 shoes.

1. **First, figure out how many pencils there are at the start:**
   - There are 30 students in the class.
   - Each student has 10 pencils.
   - So, the total number of pencils at the start is 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Next, find out how many pencils were used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - 1/5 of 300 pencils = 300 / 5 = 60 pencils.
   - So, 60 pencils were used after two months.

3. **Now, calculate how many pencils are left after two months:**
   - Total pencils at the start = 300 pencils.
   - Pencils used = 60 pencils.
   - Pencils left after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

4. **Finally, figure out how many pencils are left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils are left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

First, let's set up the equation. If \( c \) is the number of carrot sticks Matt eats, then the number of cookies he can have is:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we can write:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

Now, let's solve for \( c \):

1. Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
   \[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
   \[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
   \[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
   \[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long the remoras are in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing 6 by 12:

6 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so we need to find the total length of both remoras:

2 remoras × 0.5 feet/remora = 1 foot

Now, we know the shark is 10 feet long. To find out what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up, we use this formula:

(Length of remoras ÷ Length of shark) × 100%

So, we plug in the numbers:

(1 foot ÷ 10 feet) × 100% = 0.1 × 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

If 20 students do not have desktop computers, then these 20 students make up one-fourth of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we need to figure out what number, when divided by 4, gives us 20.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20 \]

To solve for the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

Now, if we just add the kids allergic to dairy and the kids allergic to peanuts, we get:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \]

But wait! The 3 kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts are counted twice in this total. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the 12 kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:

So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs.

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 more songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

First, we need to figure out how many eggs Jaime can fit on the trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, we multiply:

24 eggs/tray × 2 trays = 48 eggs

This means Jaime can fit 48 eggs on the trays.

Now, Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Sally buys one small pizza for $8. That's easy enough.

Next, the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. So, we need to multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza together:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - There are 4 razors in each pack.

2. **Sale Offer:**
   - The razors are on sale for ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means if Heather buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free.

3. **Total Packs and Cost:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs, but because of the sale, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

4. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

5. **Total Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors, and she gets 2 packs.
   - So, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is the same as 25 cents.

So, the cost of each individual razor after all the discounts is:
\[
25

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - So, \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.

2. **Second Layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is also 64 inches tall.
   - So, \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.

3. **Third Layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   - So, \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.

4. **Top Layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - So, \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches.

Now, we add all these heights together to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[
53

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Charisma works for 8 hours each day. Every hour, she takes a 5-minute break to walk. So, in one day, she takes 8 breaks.

To find out how many minutes she walks in one day, we multiply the number of breaks by the minutes per break:
\[ 8 \text{ breaks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/break} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes she walks over 5 days. We multiply the minutes she walks in one day by the number of days:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes.

1. Brett is 14 years old right now.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
4. If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then right now she is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is 38 years old right now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Paul drives his car twice every day for 14 days. He drives in the morning and in the afternoon.

1. **Morning Rides:**
   - Each morning ride costs $6.
   - He drives in the morning for 14 days.
   - So, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

2. **Afternoon Rides:**
   - Each afternoon ride costs $2.
   - He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.
   - So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total amount of money Paul spent, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides.
   - Total cost = \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, Paul spent 112 dollars on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box has 10 oranges. So, we do:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, we do:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges that Ashley and Brianne brought together to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To make one Greek orange pie, you need 3 oranges. So, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies.

"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in math class.

Mark has two choices for a party place. The first place costs $200 no matter how many people come, but he also has to pay $5 for each person for food. The second place costs $25 for each person, and that includes the food.

We want to find out how many people need to come to the party so that both places cost the same amount.

Let's call the number of people \( x \).

For the first place:
- The cost is $200 plus $5 for each person.
- So, the total cost is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second place:
- The cost is $25 for each person.
- So, the total cost is \( 25x \).

We want these two costs to be the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]
2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, if 10 people come to the party, both places will cost the same amount.

The answer is:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Then, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- And Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects (since David found half of what Bodhi found).

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of insects:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Let's combine like terms:
\[ D + D + 7 + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( D \). First, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used together. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

To add these fractions, we need to have the same bottom number (denominator). The bottom number for 1/4 is 4, and for 1/2, it's 2. The smallest number that both 4 and 2 can divide into is 4. So, we need to change 1/2 to a fraction with 4 as the bottom number.

1/2 is the same as 2/4 because 1 times 2 is 2, and 2 times 2 is 4.

Now we can add the fractions:
1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

So, together, they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. We know that a full skein has 364 yards. To find 3/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 3 and then divide by 4.

364 * 3 = 1092
1092 / 4 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

First, we know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so:
3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug).

Next, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we need to find twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:
2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) = 16 feet
16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

So, the couch is 18 feet long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape, and 1 pack of green apple. The grape pack cost $2, and the green apple pack cost half as much as the grape pack, so that's $1.

Now, we know the total cost for all the gum was $7. We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's call the cost of each strawberry pack \( S \).

So, the total cost can be written as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

First, add the costs of the grape and green apple packs:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Now, the equation looks like this:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Next, subtract 3 from both sides to solve for \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4 / 2 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

1. **Cost of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6.

2. **Number of Sticks:**
   - From a 2 x 4 piece of wood, you get 200 sticks.
   - From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, you get 400 sticks.

3. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

4. **Cheapest Option:**
   - The 2 x 4 piece of wood is cheaper at $4 each.

5. **How Many 2 x 4 Pieces Can He Buy?**
   - If each 2 x 4 piece costs $4, and he has $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

6. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.
   - So, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will give \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

2. Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Each pair covers 2 legs.
   - So, 24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

3. Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
   - So, 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

   2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much these 10 trips cost. Each trip costs $2.20, so we multiply:
   \[
   10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week}
   \]

3. Now, we know that a weekly bus pass costs $20.00. To find out how much Janet saves, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the trips:

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:

- On the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- In the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

   - Now, we add up the quarts picked by each person:
   - Tony: 6 quarts
   - Bobby: 5 quarts
   - Kathy: 10 quarts
   - Ricky: 8 quarts
   - Total: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, together, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The bakers made 200 loaves of bread on Monday.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 loaves.

First, we need to find out how many loaves were sold in total:
93 loaves in the morning + 39 loaves in the afternoon = 132 loaves sold.

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 loaves baked - 132 loaves sold = 68 loaves left.

Finally, we add the 6 loaves that were returned:
68 loaves left + 6 loaves returned = 74 loaves.

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

74"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in each row. So, we divide 36 by 6:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant. He has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. So, we divide 24 by 8:
\[ 24 \div 8 = 3 \]
So, Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to get the total number of rows:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Heather has a big bag of raisins with 27 cups in it. She wants to use these raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. She decides to split the raisins equally among these three things.

First, we need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she's splitting the 27 cups equally, we divide 27 by 3:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

So, Heather will use 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup per batch:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

12"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Ada spends on electricity each day right now. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour costs $1.50. So, we multiply:

\[ 12 \, \text{kilowatts per hour} \times 1.50 \, \text{dollars per kilowatt per hour} = 18 \, \text{dollars per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the new device will add to her daily cost. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, and each kilowatt per hour still costs $1.50. So, we multiply again:

\[ 2 \, \text{kilowatts per hour} \times 1.50 \, \text{dollars per kilowatt per hour} = 3 \, \text{dollars per day} \]

Now, we add the cost of the new device to her current daily cost to find the total daily cost after adding the device:

\[ 18 \, \text{dollars per day} + 3 \, \text{dollars per day} = 21 \, \text{dollars per day} \]

To find out how much Ada spends in a week, we multiply the daily cost by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Current weekly cost} = 18 \, \text{dollars per day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 126 \, \text{dollars} \]
\[ \text{Weekly cost after adding the device} = 21 \, \text{dollars per day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 147 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, to find the difference in her weekly bill, we subtract the current weekly cost from the new weekly cost:

\[ 147 \, \text{dollars} - 126 \, \text{dollars} = 21 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. So, to paint a whole house, it would take that person twice as long, which is 10 days.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to figure out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is 10 times 24, which equals 240 hours.

If 5 people are working together, they can do the job 5 times faster. So, we divide the total hours by 5. That means 240 hours divided by 5 equals 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem says that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, she must have 2 more chairs than that. 

\[ \text{Chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, the problem tells us that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3 to find out how many chairs Jenna has.

\[ \text{Chairs Jenna has} = 22 \times 3 = 66 \]

Now, the problem also says that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Jenna has 66 chairs, she must have 2 fewer sofas.

\[ \text{Sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

To find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together, we add up all the sofas and all the chairs:

\[ \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

172"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. The total amount he paid was $48. We need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

First, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44.

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 left. We need to figure out how many more CDs he could buy with that $44. Each CD costs $4, so we divide $44 by $4:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Josh tracked his workouts for 8 weeks. Most of the time, he worked out for 4 hours each week. But there were a couple of times when he worked out more:

1. For two weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
2. For one week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's count how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
- He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
- So, the total number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:
- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Finally, let's add all these hours together:
\[ 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial number of passengers:** There are 48 people on the bus.
2. **First stop:**
   - 8 people get off the bus.
   - So, the number of people left on the bus is \( 48 - 8 = 40 \).
   - Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.
   - 5 times 8 is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).
   - So, 40 more people get on the bus.
   - The new total number of people on the bus is \( 40 + 40 = 80 \).

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 people get off the bus.
   - So, the number of people left on the bus is \( 80 - 21 = 59 \).
   - Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus.
   - 3 times fewer than 21 is \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \).
   - So, 7 more people get on the bus.
   - The new total number of people on the bus is \( 59 + 7 = 66 \).

So, after the second stop, there are 66 passengers on the bus.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Jame's Age in 5 Years:**
   - The problem says Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, to find out how old Jame is now, we subtract 5 from 27.
   - \( 27 - 5 = 22 \)
   - Jame is 22 years old now.

2. **Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8.
   - \( 22 + 8 = 30 \)
   - Jame will be 30 years old in 8 years.

3. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - The problem says that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - First, we find twice Jame's age in 8 years.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
   - Then, we subtract 5 from 60 to find the cousin's age in 8 years.
   - \( 60 - 5 = 55 \)
   - Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years.

4. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - To find out how old the cousin is now, we subtract 8 from 55.
   - \( 55 - 8 = 47 \)
   - Jame's cousin is 47 years old now.

5. **Age Difference:**
   - To find the age difference between Jame and his cousin now, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age.
   - \( 47 - 22 = 25 \)
   - The age difference is 25 years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know the computer costs $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so we subtract $400 from $1,100 to find the printer's cost:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700
   \]
   So, the printer costs $700.
3. Now, we add the cost of the computer and the printer to find out how much they both cost together:
   \[
   1100 + 700 = 1800
   \]
   So, the computer and printer together cost $1,800.
4. Errol spent a total of $2,400 on everything. To find out how much he spent on the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total:
   \[
   2400 - 1800 = 600
   \]
   So, the 2 monitors together cost $600.
5. To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
   \[
   600 \div 2 = 300

First, we know that there are 20 kids, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. That's a lot of seashells!

Now, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells the boys brought plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, we need to figure out what ""four times as many"" means.

If each boy brought 60 seashells, then four times that amount is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

So, each girl brought back:
\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book. So, we take the thickness of the second book (50 mm) and subtract 5 mm: 
   \[ 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ mm} \]
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. So, we take the thickness of the first book (31 mm) and multiply it by 2:
   \[ 31 \times 2 = 62 \text{ mm} \]

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]

Next, add 45 to 81:
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]

Finally, add 62 to 126:

- In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
- In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
- In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

First, let's add up the vlogs she has already made:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs. We do this by subtracting the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

Now, the total bill is $60. Your wife wants to split the original bill ($50) evenly, so each of you pays half of that:
\[ 50 \div 2 = 25 \]

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so we can split the month into two halves: the first 15 days and the second 15 days.

1. **First Half of April:**
   - Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
   - So, in the first 15 days, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of April:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half.
   - So, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day in the second half.
   - In the second 15 days, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

3. **Total Savings:**
   - The total amount saved in April is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half.
   - So, \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know the total savings should be $1125.
   - So, \( 45x = 1125 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 45: \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

6. **Amount Saved Each Day in the Second Half:**
   - Since \( x = 25 \), the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

Next, we calculate how much Jenny earns. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, we multiply 0.5 by 20:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. Jeff and Brad are splitting 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

First, let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

Now, we know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

   - He lost 10 pounds per month.
   - He was sick for 3 months.
   - So, 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

2. Next, we know his final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight he lost to his final weight:
   - Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
   - Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend on his school supplies.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs:
- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each. So, \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each. So, \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12.00 each. So, \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\).
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10.00 each. So, \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\).

Now, let's add up all these costs to get the total before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

First, we need to find out how much Carly spent on each type of food and drink.

1. **Hamburgers:**
   - She bought 5 hamburgers.
   - Each hamburger costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for hamburgers is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Potato Fries:**
   - She bought 10 packs of potato fries.
   - Each pack costs $0.30.
   - So, the total cost for potato fries is \( 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \) dollars.

3. **Fruit Drinks:**
   - She bought 5 cans of fruit drinks.
   - Each can costs $2.
   - So, the total cost for fruit drinks is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Carly spent:
- Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
- Total cost = \( 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \) dollars

Carly gave a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how much change she gets back:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = \( 50 - 33 = 17 \) dollars

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy. We do this by subtracting the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, we need to figure out what ""twice as long"" means and then add 2 minutes to it.

Twice as long as 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to 32 minutes:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much John makes in one week. He works 5 hours each day for 4 days a week. So, the total hours he works in a week is:
5 hours/day * 4 days/week = 20 hours/week

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in a week. He gets paid $2 for each hour he works. So, his weekly earnings are:
20 hours/week * $2/hour = $40/week

Now, John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the foot-long fish sub costs $40.

Next, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, we need to multiply $40 by 3:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of both subs together:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

1. First, we know there are 21 buttons in total.
2. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each.
3. The rest of the buttons, which is 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, have 4 holes each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes:

- For the 7 buttons with 2 holes each: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes
- For the 14 buttons with 4 holes each: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Finally, we add the holes together:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70."

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

3 cubic inches"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that Octavia drinks half of the 4 cups of coffee that are recommended daily. So, Octavia drinks 2 cups of coffee each day.

Next, Juan drinks 10 times as much coffee as Octavia. So, Juan drinks 10 times 2 cups, which is 20 cups of coffee each day.

The doctor wants Juan to drink only the recommended 4 cups of coffee each day. So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from 20 cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks:
20 cups - 4 cups = 16 cups

So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by 16 cups.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, we do:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \]
Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So, we do:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \]
Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. We add their weights together:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]
The total weight is 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]
The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

So, the answer is:

1. **Starting Point**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees above the ground when you're standing at Sahir's house.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves up 5 degrees every hour.

3. **Time Passed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement**: To find out how much the sun moves in 10 hours, we multiply the number of hours by the degrees it moves each hour:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle**: To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the total movement:
   \[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know the ages of James's two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the younger son is:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total. The older son needs 12 candles, and the younger son needs 8 candles. So, the total number of candles is:
   \[
   12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles}
   \]

3. Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how much James spends, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. We know she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time into pages. We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in one minute, we do:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let \( N \) be the nephew's age today, in 7 years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
1. First, divide both sides by 3:
   \[ 51 \div 3 = N + 7 \]
   \[ 17 = N + 7 \]

2. Next, subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[ 17 - 7 = N \]
   \[ 10 = N \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of what she got for the previous three teeth, which is $0.50 each. So, that's 2 teeth * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Richie scored 80 goals. The problem says he scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's score:
80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

Next, the problem also says Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's score:
80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored together, we add up their individual scores:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

1. **Total Money Peter Has:**
   Peter starts with $70.

2. **Spending on Wooden Action Figures:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends money on wooden action figures.
   - Each wooden action figure costs $5.
   - He spends an equal amount each day, so for 4 days, he spends \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) dollars.
   - The number of wooden action figures he buys is \( 20 \div 5 = 4 \).

3. **Remaining Money:**
   - After buying the wooden action figures, he has \( 70 - 20 = 50 \) dollars left.

4. **Spending on Plastic Action Figures:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, he spends money on plastic action figures.
   - Each plastic action figure costs $2.
   - He spends an equal amount each day, so for 3 days, he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
   - The number of plastic action figures he buys is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \).

5. **Total Number of Action Figures:**
   - The total number of action figures is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures.
   - Total action figures = 4 wooden figures + 3 plastic figures = 7 figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 7 action figures.

First, we need to know how many roses Ford grows each week:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Next, we need to find out how many roses the flower shops order each week:
- The first shop orders 20 roses.
- The second shop orders 15 roses.
- The third shop orders 30 roses.

Now, let's add up the total number of roses the shops order each week:
- Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how many roses the shops order in a month:
- Total roses ordered per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

Now, let's find out how many roses Ford can grow in a month:
- Total roses Ford grows per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

Finally, we need to figure out how many roses Ford lacks to meet the demand:
- Roses Ford lacks = Total roses ordered per month - Total roses Ford grows per month
- Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

   - So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - The food truck spends $30.00 on cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

3. **Total Cost for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Add the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments:
   - $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

4. **Revenue from Selling 10 Sandwiches:**
   - The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.
   - For 10 sandwiches, they make:
   - 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

5. **Net Profit:**
   - To find the net profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's break down the costs:

1. **New Carpet:**
   The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   \[ 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2,592 \]

2. **Padding:**
   The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   \[ 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

3. **Removing Old Carpet:**

- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

So, let's add these numbers:
50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds

Next, we need to find the average number of birds he saw each day. To do this, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days in the week:

Maggie's oven is a bit tricky. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's going 18 degrees too high. 

To find out what percentage that is, we can use a simple formula:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the difference is 18 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to figure out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to if she wants it to actually reach 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find a temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

Let's call the temperature she should set the oven to \( x \). The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x \), which is the same as \( 1.04x \).

We want \( 1.04x \) to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to get it to actually reach 520 degrees.

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's house. Now, we subtract that from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house to get the total:

First, we need to find out how much 2 boxes of contacts cost with the discount. Each box is $100, but there's a 10% discount. So, the discount on one box is:
\[ 100 \times 0.10 = 10 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets. Each box has 90 contacts, and since he buys 2 boxes, he gets:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 2 hours, John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill. Since Jill worked 1 hour, John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them earned:
- Jill earned $10 per hour, so for 3 hours, she earned 3 * $10 = $30.
- John earned $10 per hour, so for 7 hours, he earned 7 * $10 = $70.

Finally, we need to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does two types of exercises: aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She does aerobics for 2 hours.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she burns 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She runs for 1 hour.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, for 1 hour, she burns 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. The rule is that she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

- For 1600 calories, the amount of water she needs is 1600 calories * (100 ml / 200 calories) = 800 ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

800 ml"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We have a big jar of jelly beans at Burger Palace. The jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says:
- There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

First, let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B \]

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B \]

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Let's add these together:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know:
- The number of blue jelly beans is 1500.
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM).
2. After some lessons, his speed goes up to 52 WPM.
3. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:
   \[
   52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM}
   \]

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds. To do that, we add all three speeds together and then divide by 3.

So, let's add the speeds:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Next, we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is:
\[

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would lose:
\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, in 5 weeks, he would gain:
\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight between the two options, we add the weight he would lose to the weight he would gain:
\[ 6.25 \text{ pounds} + 8.75 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - So, the number of friends coming is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of spouses coming is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).

4. **Total from Phone Calls:**
   - The total number of people from the phone calls is \(10 + 8 = 18\).

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Adding the totals from the email invitations and the phone calls gives us \(300 + 18 = 318\).

3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:

2. **eBay Cost:**
   - The boots cost $13.
   - The shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.
   - So, the total cost on eBay is \( 13 + 8 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Difference in Cost:**
   - The total cost on eBay is $21.
   - The total cost on Amazon is $20.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 20 = 1 \) dollar.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Mark's beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, which is the height of Mark's second-story window.

Let's break it down:

- On Day 0, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- On Day 1, it doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- On Day 2, it doubles again to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- On Day 3, it doubles once more to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

So, on Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, if John eats 200 grams, that's double the amount, which means he gets double the protein:
   - 200 grams of mushrooms = 2 × 3 grams of protein = 6 grams of protein per day.

2. Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   - 6 grams of protein per day × 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, if we say Jerry's age right now is \( J \), then 5 years ago, he was \( J - 5 \) years old.

The problem says that Jerry's current age is twice what he was 5 years ago. So we can write this as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

To get \( J \) by itself, we need to move \( 2J \) to the other side:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]

Now, we can solve for \( J \) by dividing both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is 10 years old right now. The question asks how old Jerry will be in 3 years. If Jerry is 10 years old now, in 3 years he will be:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much the dental work will cost in total. George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, for 2 implants, it would be:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

One of the implants needs a special crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, we add that to the total:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already paid a deposit of $600. So, we need to subtract that from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to pay:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, George earns $15 per hour at his job. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). 

The problem says one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \).

It also says one angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \).

Now, we can write an equation to represent the sum of these angles:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Let's add the \( x \) terms together:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. 

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. First, we need to know how much money he has in total.

- He has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth 8 × 25 = 200 cents.
- He has 6 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth 6 × 10 = 60 cents.
- He has 14 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth 14 × 5 = 70 cents.
- He has 15 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth 15 × 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money together:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

- Dogs have 4 legs.
- Cats have 4 legs.
- Birds have 2 legs.

Now, let's count the legs for each type of animal:
- There are 5 dogs, so 5 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.
- There are 2 cats, so 2 cats × 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.
- There are 10 birds, so 10 birds × 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Next, we add up all the legs:
20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48.

Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He decides to increase the weight by 50%. To find out how much 50% of 8 pounds is, we can do this:

50% of 8 pounds = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, if he adds 4 pounds to the 8-pound weight, the new weight is:

8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

But 12 pounds is too heavy for him, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure out how many video games Steve has after 3 years.

1. **Birthday Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.

2. **Games He Buys:**
   - In the first year, he buys 1 game each month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
   - In the second year, he buys 2 games each month. So, he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
   - In the third year, he buys 4 games each month. So, he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

3. **Christmas Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for Christmas each year. Over 3 years, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all the games together:
- Birthday games: 5
- First year games: 12
- Second year games: 24
- Third year games: 48
- Christmas games: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. If Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, then in one hour, he makes:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, let's see how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade.

First, for the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he made 15 cups × $0.50 = $7.50.
- For four hours, he made 4 hours × $7.50 = $30.

Next, for the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he made 10 cups × $0.60 = $6.
- For two hours, he made 2 hours × $6 = $12.

Now, we add the money he made in the first four hours and the next two hours:
- Total money made = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate in one month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, we can set up a simple proportion:

\[ \text{If 2 miles = 725 rotations, then 400 miles = ? rotations} \]

To find the number of rotations for 400 miles, we can multiply:

\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

So, the tires rotate 145,000 times in one month.

Next, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we know that each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. We need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach this limit. We can do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives you 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time. But Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash. 

First, we need to figure out how many washes Jackie can get with 1 pump. If 2 pumps give 120 washes, then 1 pump will give twice as many washes, because she's using half the amount of shampoo per wash. So:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we know the bottle costs $24.00 and gives 240 washes. To find out how much each pump costs, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

Now, there's a 30% off sale, which means Joe only pays 70% of the total price. To find 70% of $60, we multiply:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the shirt and shorts for $42, we subtract to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase."

\[ 150 \times 194 = 29,100 \]

So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter to repave. So, we multiply 490 by 194:

\[ 490 \times 194 = 95,060 \]

So, it costs $95,060 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960 \]

2. **Total research time:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months.
   - So, the total research time is 5 months × 10 = 50 months.

3. **Additional months:**
   - After the first 5 months, there are 50 months - 5 months = 45 more months.
   - For these additional months, each month costs 50% more than the first 5 months.
   - So, each additional month costs $20,000 + ($20,000 × 0.5) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

4. **Cost for the additional 45 months:**
   - The cost for these 45 months is 45 months × $30,000 = $1,350,000.

5. **Total cost:**

- She also bought 3 pieces of coral. Each piece costs $2.00, so 3 pieces cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- She got 20 fish, and each fish costs $0.50, so 20 fish cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
- Lastly, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

Total: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, Jane's beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. 

Then, in the second week, it doubled in height. So, 3 inches times 2 is 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, 6 inches plus 4 inches is 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much meat Prince sells in one day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours each day. So, we multiply 15 kg by 10 hours:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull. The bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:

\[ 750 \, \text{kg} \div 150 \, \text{kg/day} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. The auditorium has 4 rows, and each row has 18 seats. So, we multiply:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we know that one-fourth of the seats were taken by the administrators. To find out how many seats that is, we divide 72 by 4:
\[ 72 \div 4 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

One-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. To find out how many seats that is, we divide 54 by 3:
\[ 54 \div 3 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were taken by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many street lights are at one intersection. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, we multiply the number of street lights per pole by the number of poles:
\[ 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \]

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are on the entire road. There are 4 intersections, so we multiply the number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Now, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. To find out how many are working, we subtract the number of non-working street lights from the total number of street lights:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-working street lights} = 76 \text{ working street lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 356 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
   - 1000 - 356 = 644 times

2. The second DVD can also be played 1000 times in total. It has already been played 135 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
   - 1000 - 135 = 865 times

3. Now, we add the remaining plays for both DVDs to find the total number of times they can be played before they break:
   - 644 + 865 = 1509 times

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. Each week, he went twice, so that's 6 weeks * 2 times per week = 12 times.
3. Each session was 2 hours long, so 12 times * 2 hours = 24 hours in total.
4. The cost per hour is $125, so 24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Jim has a 20-pack of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours during his 8-hour school day. So, he chews:
   \[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]
3. He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, he chews:
   \[ 4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]
4. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:
   \[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]
5. Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:
   \[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]
6. Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
   \[ 14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, that means right now, she is 16 minus 12, which is 4 years old. Now, if we want to know how old she will be 4 years from now, we just add 4 to her current age. So, 4 plus 4 equals 8. 

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs, and each one costs $3. So, we multiply 9 by 3:
9 * 3 = 27
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, we need to find out how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs, and each one costs $14. So, we multiply 8 by 14:
8 * 14 = 112
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:
112 - 27 = 85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

85"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna planted in total. She has 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find this, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour}
   \]

2. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobytes (kb) per second. To find out how many kilobytes she can download in an hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in an hour:
   \[
   20 \text{ kb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 72000 \text{ kb}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert kilobytes to megabytes. There are 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte, so:
   \[
   72000 \text{ kb} \div 1000 = 72 \text{ Mb}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, we can calculate the total number of cars for these three days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day. So, the number of cars towed each day for these four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars for these four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days to get the total for the week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
54"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how tall Adam needs to be to ride the roller coaster. The height requirement is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the height in inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. We need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 more inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows each year:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Okay, let's figure out how much James made from selling the cars.

First, we need to find out how much money he made from selling all the cars. He sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, the total money from selling the cars is:
10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

Next, we need to find out how much the company spent to buy these cars. The company paid 30% of the price to get each car. So, for each car, the company paid:
30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500

For 10 cars, the total cost to the company is:
10 cars * $7,500 per car = $75,000

Now, we can find out the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total sales:
$250,000 (total sales) - $75,000 (total cost) = $175,000 (profit)

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

$17,500"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know there are 100 surfers. When a big wave comes, only 25% of them can stay on their boards. So, we need to find out how many that is:

100 surfers × 25% = 100 × 0.25 = 25 surfers

So, 25 surfers can stay upright.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 surfers are women. We need to find out how many women that is:

25 surfers × 60% = 25 × 0.60 = 15 women

So, 15 of the surfers who stay upright are women.

Now, to find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who stay upright:

25 surfers - 15 women = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

10"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 of the price of a diamond Jewell. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 4/5:
   \[
   2000 \times \frac{4}{5} = 2000 \times 0.8 = 1600
   \]
   So, the price of a gold Jewell is $1600.

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. So, we subtract 400 from 1600:
   \[
   1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
   So, the price of a silver Jewell is $1200.

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10

So, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in math class.

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up to Bob.

First, we need to figure out how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob. We do this by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap. We do this by dividing the distance by the rate at which Tom is catching up:
\[ \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

   Darren caught 11 fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we add 3 to 11:

   Tommy caught 14 fish.

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Manny signed up for Karate classes, and it costs $60 for 10 classes. His parents said if the cost per class goes over $10, they won't sign him up again.

First, let's figure out the cost per class if Manny goes to all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will go up. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class will be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x \) is positive):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many customers Jewel processes in a week by multiplying 50 by 7:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
So, Jewel processes 350 customers in a week.

Now, Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. This means Julie can process twice as many customers as Jewel in the same amount of time. So, if Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
So, Julie processes 100 customers each day.

To find out how many customers Julie processes in a week, we multiply 100 by 7:
\[ 100 \times 7 = 700 \]
So, Julie processes 700 customers in a week.

To find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, we add the number of customers each processes in a week:
\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

So, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is:
\[ 1050 \]

   - So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn.
   - If Reggie ran 20 miles, then Lynn ran \( 20 - 3 = 17 \) miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples cost. If one apple costs $1.30, then 5 apples cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
So, 5 apples cost $6.50.

Next, we need to find out how much 5 oranges cost. If one orange costs $1.10, then 5 oranges cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
So, 5 oranges cost $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much dirt Bob needs to move. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the total amount of dirt, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 3 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

So, Bob needs to move 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of dirt. To find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:

\[ 72 \text{ cubic feet} \times 3 \text{ seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill's new truck will cost. We need to add up the base price and all the extra stuff he wants.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade. So, we divide $7,500 by 3:
   \[
   7500 \div 3 = 2500
   \]
   So, the leather seats cost $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. So, we subtract $500 from $2,500:
   \[
   2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
   So, the running boards cost $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

First, add the base price and the king cab:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]

Next, add the leather seats:
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000

Then, add the running boards:
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000

Finally, add the upgraded exterior light package:
\[
42000 + 1500 = 43500

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Tim's current salary:**
   - Tim makes $20,000 a month.

2. **5% raise:**
   - To find 5% of $20,000, we multiply:
     \[
     20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000
     \]
   - So, Tim's raise is $1,000.

3. **New monthly salary:**
   - Add the raise to his current salary:
     \[
     20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000
     \]
   - Tim's new monthly salary is $21,000.

4. **Bonus:**
   - The bonus is half a month's new salary:
     \[
     \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500
     \]
   - So, Tim's bonus is $10,500.

5. **Annual salary without the bonus:**
   - Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
     \[
     21,000 \times 12 = 252,000
     \]
   - Tim's annual salary without the bonus is $252,000.

6. **Total annual earnings:**
   - Add the bonus to the annual salary:
     \[
     252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500

"Okay, let's figure out how much James spent on all his new clothes.

First, we need to find out how much the suits cost. James bought 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the dress pants cost. Each pair of dress pants costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, each pair of dress pants costs:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]
James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he bought 10 suits, he bought:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dress shirts} \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total amount James spent:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we multiply 20 by 28:
\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \]
So, the news website publishes 560 articles in February.

Next, we need to find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we multiply 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \]
So, the sister company publishes 280 articles in February.

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites together, we add the two numbers together:
\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms, then one bag has:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, if we have three bags, we need to find out how much flour is in all three bags together. So, we multiply the amount in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Stanley biked. Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2.5 \text{ hours} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances that Alisa and Stanley biked to find the total distance:
\[ 54 \text{ miles} + 25 \text{ miles} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

79"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet every hour. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, we divide the total feet of soil by the feet he can dig per hour:

24 feet ÷ 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he can dig 2 feet every hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay. So, we divide the total feet of clay by the feet he can dig per hour:

8 feet ÷ 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time:

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to count how many people will get cupcakes. There's Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. So, we add these up:
   - Howie: 1
   - Teacher: 1
   - Classmates: 25

   Total number of people = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people

2. Each person gets 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). So, we need to multiply the number of people by 2 to find out the total number of cupcakes:
   - Total cupcakes = 27 people × 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie after one week. That's a lot of likes!

Then, three weeks later, she had 70 times as many likes as she did after the first week. So, we need to multiply 2000 by 70 to find out how many likes she had after four weeks:

\[ 2000 \times 70 = 140000 \]

So, after four weeks, she had 140,000 likes.

Recently, she got 20,000 more likes. To find the total number of likes now, we add these 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes she already had:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes on Fishio's selfie is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, let's see how much Clara spent on Tuesday:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates.
- Each pomegranate cost $20.
- So, the total cost before the voucher is \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
- Clara had a voucher that gave her $2 off.
- So, the total cost after the voucher is \( 400 - 2 = 398 \) dollars.

Next, let's see how much Sheila spent on Wednesday:
- Sheila also bought 20 pomegranates.
- Each pomegranate now costs $30.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- 10% of 600 is \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost after the discount is \( 600 - 60 = 540 \) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Clara and Sheila paid:
- Sheila paid $540.
- Clara paid $398.
- The difference is \( 540 - 398 = 142 \) dollars.

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how much Ariadne made from green hats:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, to find out how much she made from green hats, we multiply the sales from red hats by 2.
   - \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \)
   - Ariadne made $800 from green hats.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - We add the sales from red hats and green hats.
   - \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $1200 in the first month.

3. **Find out how much she made in the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month.
   - To find this, we multiply the first month's sales by \(\frac{3}{4}\).
   - \( 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $900 in the second month.

4. **Calculate the total sales for both months:**
   - We add the sales from the first month and the second month.
   - \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \)
   - So, Ariadne made $2100 in total over the two months.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ 2100 \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage.

1. **Total Time:**
   - James used the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours.

2. **Free Hour:**
   - He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Costs:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs twice the first hour, so it's \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour costs twice the second hour, so it's \(30 \times 2 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Total Payment:**
   - Add up the costs for the 3 paid hours: \(15 + 30 + 60 = 105\) dollars.

So, James paid:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account. By the end of the week, she had $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 more in her account this week. But Sally should have gotten $300 for her weekly wage. So, the amount that was missing from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests:
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves:
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"Okay, so Shiela needs to write a 15-page paper. She's already done 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we first need to figure out how many pages she has already written. 

1/3 of 15 pages is 5 pages. So, Shiela has written 5 pages. 

Now, to find out how many pages she has left, we subtract the pages she has written from the total number of pages she needs to write:

15 pages - 5 pages = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

\[ 200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ days} \]

The homework is due in 30 days. So, if Mike finishes in 20 days, he will have:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to know how much the plane costs:
- The plane costs $150,000.

Next, we need to figure out the monthly costs:
- James pays $5,000 each month to rent a hanger.
- He spends twice as much on fuel, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

Now, let's add the hanger and fuel costs to find the total monthly cost:
- Monthly cost = Hanger rental + Fuel cost
- Monthly cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

To find the total cost for the year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- Annual cost = Monthly cost * 12
- Annual cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

1. First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the pork took:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The beans took half the combined cooking time of the pork and the rice. First, we need to find the combined cooking time of the pork and the rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the beans took half of that time:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/2 pound of almonds costs:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture is:
\[
5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

- A pound of almonds costs $10, so 1/5 pound of almonds costs:
  \[
  \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total cost for the second mixture is:
\[
2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars}

Now, we need to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
\[
10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many sheep and geese there are.

First, let's say:
- \( S \) is the number of sheep.
- \( G \) is the number of geese.

We know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (because there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (because sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, and there are 70 legs in total)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can solve for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

So, the more expensive coffee costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys enough for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total cost for the coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost for everything is:

- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up what he spent on these items:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

198 + 209 = 407

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day:
600 - 407 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The class runs for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours John spends in the class is:

8 hours a week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:

48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

So, John learns 32 recipes.

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep together in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each one sleeps:

5 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons

For sugar:
3 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons

For salt:
0.25 tablespoons/muffin × 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add all these together to get the total amount of dry ingredients:

7 * $0.5 = $3.5

Next, he bought 10 candies of type B, and each one costs $0.75. So, we multiply 10 by $0.75:
10 * $0.75 = $7.5

Now, we add the cost of the type A candies and the type B candies to find the total cost:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Christina recorded her mood for 30 days. Out of these 30 days:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

To find out how many neutral days there were, we can subtract the good and bad days from the total days:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]
So, there were 10 neutral days.

Next, we know the distribution of the first 24 days:
- The first 8 days were all good.
- The next 8 days were all bad.
- The next 8 days were all neutral.

This means the last 6 days of the 30 days are the ones we need to figure out. The problem tells us that the next three days after the first 24 days were:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Now, let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

So, the total number of good days in the 30 days is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

But we know from the problem that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

So, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. Janey has 21 books, and we know that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

First, let's set up the equation. If Sally has \( S \) books, then Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write:

\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the desired height:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the growth rate:
   \[
   360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days}

3. After buying those 8 toys, he goes back to the shelter and finds out there are now twice as many dogs as when he left. That means there are 24 dogs now.
4. He already has 12 toys, so he needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs.
5. When he comes back again, he finds out that 3 dogs have left the shelter. So now, he only needs toys for 21 dogs.
6. He already has 24 toys, but since 3 dogs left, he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore. So, he has 21 toys, which is exactly what he needs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Lorie earns $10 per hour.
2. Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, so Karen earns:
   \[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]
3. Karen works 3 hours each day, so in one day, she earns:
   \[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]
4. Over two days, Karen earns:
   \[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can figure out how many hash browns one potato makes. 

First, we divide 36 hash browns by 6 potatoes:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, 1 potato makes 6 hash browns.

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can find out how many hash browns we can make by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns each potato makes:
\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

576"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) weigh in total. Each adult weighs about 80 kg.
2. So, we multiply the number of people by the weight of each person:
   \[
   9 \text{ people} \times 80 \text{ kg/person} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. The elevator can only hold 700 kg. So, we need to find out how much more 720 kg is than 700 kg:
   \[
   720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

20 kg"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

First, we know that Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem says Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have 5 more than that. 

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, the problem tells us that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have 12 less than that.

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Then, the problem says Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 23 more than that.

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies they all have together. We add up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ 298 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Shania's dress got longer in two ways:
1. She made it 50% longer than it was before.
2. She added 20 cm of lace at the bottom.

The final dress is 140 cm long. We need to find out how long the dress was before she made these changes.

First, let's think about the 50% increase. If the original length of the dress is \( L \), then making it 50% longer means the new length is \( L + 0.5L \), which is the same as \( 1.5L \).

Next, she added 20 cm of lace. So, the total length after both changes is:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know this total length is 140 cm, so we can write the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Now, let's solve for \( L \):
1. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 1.5L = 120 \]

2. Divide both sides by 1.5 to find \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
   \[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Chris can mow his whole lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes him 60 minutes to mow the whole lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

Next, in ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the whole lawn in 40 minutes.

Now, Chris decided to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. 

To find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
- If the whole lawn takes 60 minutes, then half the lawn will take half of 60 minutes.
- Half of 60 minutes is 30 minutes.

To find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
- If the whole lawn takes 40 minutes, then half the lawn will take half of 40 minutes.
- Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow each half:
- 30 minutes (for the ""turtle"" mode half) + 20 minutes (for the ""rabbit"" mode half) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the whole lawn.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that John and Jack have 30 minutes to get to school. They spend 6 minutes walking to the corner where the library is, and then they spend another 13 minutes walking to the fire station.

So, we need to add the time they spent walking to the library and the fire station:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas, and each kilo costs $2, so 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges, and each kilo costs $3, so 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add it all up:
- Apples: $4
- Bananas: $4
- Oranges: $6

Total cost: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays $14 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so that means Celinda bakes 60 cookies. 

Now, if we add the cookies Greta and Celinda baked together, we get:
30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

But they ate 10 cookies while they were cooling, so we need to subtract those:
90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, the number of cookies they put in the box is 80.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. We also know that the total of all their ages is 44.

Let's call the age of one of the triplets \( R \). Since one of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets, the age of one of the twins is \( R + 7 \).

Now, we have two twins and three triplets. So, the total age of the twins is \( 2 \times (R + 7) \), and the total age of the triplets is \( 3 \times R \).

The problem tells us that the combined ages of all the kids is 44. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2 \times (R + 7) + 3 \times R = 44 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, expand the equation:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]

2. Combine like terms:
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

3. Subtract 14 from both sides to isolate the term with \( R \):
\[ 5R = 30 \]

4. Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( R \):
\[ R = 6 \]

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old. Now, we need to find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T = R + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. That's 3 hours times 60 minutes in an hour, so he has 180 minutes. 

Now, let's add up the time he needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

So, 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

If he has 180 minutes before dinner and he needs 80 minutes for homework, then he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left for napping.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, let's find out how much the lollipops cost in total:

5 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find out how much the candies cost:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, the 4 candies cost $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 ÷ 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. First, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:

10 lollipops × $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of 10 candies:

10 candies × $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies together to get the total cost:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

$7.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong. First, we need to find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong.

2/5 of 20 coins is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, let's find out how many coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

To find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add Rong's and Neil's savings:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the vaccines cost. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each one costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). So, the heartworm check costs:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"Okay, let's figure out the cost of the fruit crate step by step.

First, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs:
- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- There are 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- There are 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6\) dollars.
- There are 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total cost of the crate:
- Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars

So, the price for the crate of fruit is 32 dollars."
"Okay, let's figure out how many square feet Brittany's quilted comforter is.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

So, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

   - So, the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Find out how many chairs the restaurant already has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - It has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - So, the number of regular chairs is:

Next, we know that 20 percent of these bucks are 8-point bucks. To find out how many 8-point bucks there are, we calculate 20 percent of 25:
\[ 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know how many points Adam has:
- Adam has 50 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Betty has. The problem says Betty has 30% more points than Adam:
- 30% of 50 is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \).
- So, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. The problem says Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
- Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Marta has. The problem says Marta has 3 times more points than Tom:
- Marta has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points to see how many the class has in total:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement.

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, her car payment is $480.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after putting money into her retirement and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

Next, Hannah can only see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many that is, we calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Hannah also sets off some fireworks in her backyard. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, we multiply:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, let's add up what Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry together:
4,000 pounds (Gissela) + 4,800 pounds (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total capacity of all three trucks:
11,600 pounds (total) - 8,800 pounds (Gissela and Gordy) = 2,800 pounds.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that Martha's cat can run 15 feet every second. The problem says the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, to find out how fast the turtle goes, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can go in 40 seconds. Since the turtle moves 3 feet every second, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The firefighters want to raise $6300. After 3 hours, they have already raised $2100. We need to figure out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal.

First, let's find out how much they need to raise in total:
- Total goal: $6300
- Amount already raised: $2100
- Amount still needed: $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to figure out how much they raise each hour. We know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, so:
- Amount raised per hour: $2100 ÷ 3 = $700

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200:
- Number of hours needed: $4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 6 more hours. But we also need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised:
- Total hours needed: 3 + 6 = 9 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. That means out of every 100 gallons of water in the river, the city uses 40 gallons.

2. Now, out of the 40 gallons that the city uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find out how much that is, we need to calculate 80% of 40 gallons:
   \[
   80\% \times 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. So, the city uses 32 gallons for industrial purposes. To find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial water from the total water the city uses:
   \[
   40 \text{ gallons} - 32 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out what percent 8 gallons is of the total 100 gallons in the river. We can set up the problem like this:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ gallons}} \times 100\% = 8\%

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply 7 by 2:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know Alex charges $12 for each day of tutoring. To find out how much she charges for 14 days, we multiply the number of days by the daily rate:
\[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \]

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much ice cream the factory can make in one hour for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in one hour, it makes \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in one hour, it makes \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to find out how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 48 hours, it makes \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 48 hours, it makes \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream to get the total:
- Total quarts of ice cream = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the factory would make 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

3000"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Marcus has to pay for all the yummy stuff he bought.

First, we need to find out how much each type of food costs:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add all these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50.00:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total:

$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

45.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

The ice cream parlor has a deal: if you buy 2 scoops, you get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

But with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many days are in two weeks. Since one week has 7 days, two weeks have:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in those 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day. So in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day. So in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's see how much candy they have left after 14 days.

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces left} \]

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces left} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how much of the bathroom Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. So, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:

\[ 24 \text{ tiles/square foot} \times 24 \text{ square feet} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. He paid $20 just to go picking, and then he paid $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so we need to multiply 30 by $1.5.

\[ 30 \times 1.5 = 45 \]

So, the cost of the blueberries he picked is $45. Now, we add the $20 he paid to go picking:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is $65.

Next, we need to find out how much it would have cost him to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so we multiply 30 by $2.5:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, it would have cost him $75 to buy the blueberries at the store.

Now, to find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

   \[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

2. So, the new price of each computer is:
   \[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 500 computers at the new price. We do:
   \[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"Okay, let's figure out how many calories are in John's omelet. We need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's look at the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from the eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

Next, let's look at the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
- So, the total calories from the cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

Now, let's look at the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham (the same as the cheese).
- Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
- So, the total calories from the ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Finally, we add up all the calories:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80

Total calories in the omelet: \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
6 pencils * $0.50 = $3.00

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
8 erasers * $0.25 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to get the total cost:
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

You paid $10, so to find out how much change you get, we subtract the total cost from $10:
$10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

So, the change you would get is $5.00.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, we need to find out how many people get interviews.**
   - We know that 100 people apply for the job.
   - Only 30% of these people get interviews.
   - To find 30% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.30.
   - \( 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \)
   - So, 30 people get interviews.

2. **Next, we need to find out how many of those who get interviews receive a job offer.**
   - We know that 20% of the people who get interviews receive a job offer.
   - To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.20.
   - \( 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \)
   - So, 6 people receive a job offer.

3. **Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer actually accept the position.**
   - We know that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position.
   - To find a third of 6, we divide 6 by 3.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many taps Helga makes with each foot when her arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

1. **When her arms are at her sides:**
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute
   - She dances like this for 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes total and 2 minutes with her arms raised).

   So, for the right foot:
   \[
   300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}
   \]

   And for the left foot:
   \[
   250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}
   \]

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - Right foot: 200 taps per minute
   - Left foot: 200 taps per minute
   - She dances like this for 2 minutes.

   So, for the right foot:
   \[
   200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}
   \]

   And for the left foot:
   \[
   200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}
   \]

3. **Total taps for each foot:**
   - Right foot: \(900 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(750 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

4. **Combined total taps for both feet:**

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how much it will cost Ron if he doesn't fix the pothole. The problem says it will do $450 worth of damage to his car. So, if he doesn't fix it, he loses $450.

Next, let's see how much it will cost him if he fixes the pothole himself. The city will fine him $120 for fixing it without permission. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25. So, the cost for the asphalt is:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Now, we add the fine and the cost of the asphalt to find the total cost of fixing the pothole:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

So, if Ron fixes the pothole, he will spend $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the cost of fixing it from the cost of the damage:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself. 

The answer is: 255"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many chairs the restaurant had at the start:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

So, the total number of chairs at the start is:
170 + 23 = 193 chairs

Next, we need to find out how many chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

So, the total number of chairs sent for repair is:
20 + 13 = 33 chairs

Now, to find out how many chairs are left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160 chairs

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Each of these 3 people ate 2/3 of 12 slices.
   - 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices per person.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the other two friends:**
   - The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Each of these 2 people ate 3/4 of 12 slices.
   - 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices per person.
   - Total slices eaten by the other two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (other two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. That's pretty straightforward.

Next, we're told that a dog can eat the same number of sausages, but it does it in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. So, we need to figure out what 2/3 of 30 minutes is.

To find 2/3 of 30 minutes:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat nine sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time it takes the cat and the time it takes the dog, and then divide by 2.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how long Topher's shoe is in inches. We know that 8 feet and 4 inches is the same as 8 feet plus 4 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 8 feet is 8 times 12, which is 96 inches. So, 8 feet and 4 inches is 96 inches plus 4 inches, which equals 100 inches.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem, Topher's shoe is 100 inches, so we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The answer is:

- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many of these windows Hannah smashed:
- She smashed a quarter of the students' car windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

Now, let's do the same for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Next, we need to find out how many of these windows Hannah smashed:
- She smashed 3/4 of the teachers' car windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

- Dark green spools: 50

So, the total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add up the blue spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

So, the total number of blue spools is:
15 + 45 = 60 spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

Then, add 8 to that: \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

So, Dora's dad is 38 years old.

Next, Dora's mom is four years younger than her dad. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's dad's age:

\( 38 - 4 = 34 \).

So, Dora's mom is 34 years old.

- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Math and science books: 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds

2. Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate:
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C got. We know the total number of votes is 100, and we already know how many votes candidates A and B got. So, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total:
   - Total votes = 100
   - Votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes
   - Votes for C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

- For the giant cubes, each one uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 of these, so:
  \[ 4 \text{ ounces} \times 3 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

- For the medium cubes, each one uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 of these, so:
  \[ 2 \text{ ounces} \times 7 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

- For the small cubes, each one uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 of these, so:
  \[ 0.5 \text{ ounces} \times 8 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up all the water used for the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Clara has 20 books, and that's twice as many as Steven has. So, if we divide Clara's books by 2, we can find out how many books Steven has:
\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has compared to Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books, so:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. The problem also says that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we take $2 away from the cost of a gallon jar, we can find out how much a half-gallon jar costs:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, we multiply the number of gallon jars by the cost of each:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

So, she spent $50 on gallon jars.

Now, let's calculate how much she spent on 16 half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon jar costs $3, so we multiply the number of half-gallon jars by the cost of each:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

So, she spent $48 on half-gallon jars.

Finally, to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know there are 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students like either video games or music.

The problem says that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like basketball, the number of students who like music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's add up the students who like baking, basketball, and music:
\[ 10 \text{ (baking)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} + 10 \text{ (music)} = 25 \]

So, 25 students are accounted for. The rest of the students must like video games. To find out how many that is, we subtract the 25 students from the total number of students:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard. He threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of them. To find out how many birds were scared away, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds flew away. Now, we need to figure out how many birds are left:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

After that, 20 more birds came to join the ones that stayed. So, we add those 20 birds to the 8 that were left:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

28"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 80 students in total, and they are split equally between two classes. So, each class has:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students}
   \]

2. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. Now, to find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
   \[
   40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys}
   \]

So, there are 24 boys in each class. 

24"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Then, she added 3 more slices. So, we add 2 and 3:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]
3. Mara got really hungry and decided to triple the number of slices. So, we multiply 5 by 3:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices. So, we subtract 2 from 15:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13 \text{ slices}
   \]
5. While Mara was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices. So, we subtract 5 from 13:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is:
\[
8

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up all the animals Melissa has to groom:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

So, 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals in total.

Now, Melissa wants to split these jobs evenly over the 7 days of the week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day.

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs, and each pack cost $1800. So, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]
So, Mark spent $5400 on the packs.

Next, we need to find out how much money Mark made from selling the cards. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. Let's add up the value of these cards:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + (30 \times 50) \]
First, calculate the value of the 30 cards:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]
Now, add up all the values:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]
So, Mark made $6500 from selling the cards.

To find out how much profit Mark made, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark's profit is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first one.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for each park.

For the first amusement park:
- Each adult costs $26, and there are 2 adults, so \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- Each child costs $12, and there are 2 children, so \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- Each adult costs $14, and there are 2 adults, so \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- Each child costs $10, and there are 2 children, so \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much they save by choosing the second park:
- The difference in cost is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will save 28 dollars by choosing the second amusement park.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much the tomato vendor used to spend on tomatoes each day. He used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each. So, we multiply 500 by $0.5:
\[ 500 \times 0.5 = 250 \]
So, he used to spend $250 each day.

Next, we need to find out how much he spends now with the new vendor. The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each. So, we multiply 500 by $0.4:
\[ 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \]
So, he now spends $200 each day.

Now, we need to find out how much he saves each day. We subtract the new daily cost from the old daily cost:
\[ 250 - 200 = 50 \]
So, he saves $50 each day.

Finally, we need to find out how much he saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily savings by 7:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
So, he saves $350 each week.

The vendor saves $350 a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. 

Next, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we multiply Sean's marbles by 4:
\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \]
So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Then, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, we multiply Sean's marbles by 2 to find out how many marbles Cal has:
\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:
\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

336"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we have 54 students, and they need to be divided into 6 groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide 54 by 6:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

So, each group has 9 students.

Now, the activity requires 12 groups instead of 6. We already have 6 groups, so we need to figure out how many more groups we need to make 12 groups in total.

To find this, we subtract the number of groups we already have from the total number of groups needed:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, we need 6 more groups.

The answer is 6."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many days there are in two 4-week months:
- Each week has 7 days.
- So, in one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.
- In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 28 = 56\) days.

Next, we need to figure out how many of these days are weekdays and how many are weekends:
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

Now, let's calculate how many chairs are rented on weekdays:
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
- So, in 40 weekdays, she rents \(60 \times 40 = 2400\) chairs.

Next, let's calculate how many chairs are rented on weekends:
- Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
- So, in 16 weekend days, she rents \(100 \times 16 = 1600\) chairs.

Finally, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total:
- Total chairs rented = \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\).

So, Candy will rent out 4000 chairs in total in two 4-week months.

   \]
   The total cost for the year is $1200.

2. Next, we need to divide this total cost by the number of roommates, including Jenna. There are 4 roommates plus Jenna, so that's 5 people in total. We divide the total cost by 5:
   \[
   1200 \div 5 = 240

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many glasses and plates Jeff sent to the party. He sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. 

- 1 dozen is 12, so 8 dozen glasses is 8 times 12, which equals 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates is 4 times 12, which equals 48 plates.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses and plates were broken. 

- 10 glasses were broken, so we subtract 10 from 96: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left.
- 6 plates were broken, so we subtract 6 from 48: 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find out how many Jeff has now.

- 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items in total.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

3. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
   - So, 20 large stickers are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

4. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - From trading large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.

6. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons.
   - So, 20 large buttons are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Small Buttons (Final Count):**
   - From small stickers: 87 small buttons.
   - From large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \) small buttons.

So, by the end, Lorraine has 147 buttons.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know there are 33 people on the council. The problem says that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. 

Let's use a simple way to figure this out:

1. Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is \( x \).
2. Then, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \) because it's twice as many.
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is 33.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice that, we have:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Krissa needs 11 shirts for the extra-small size.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small shirts.
   - So, 2 times 11 is 22. Krissa needs 22 small shirts.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four fewer students need medium shirts than small shirts.
   - So, 22 minus 4 is 18. Krissa needs 18 medium shirts.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts.
   - So, 18 divided by 2 is 9. Krissa needs 9 large shirts.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts.
   - So, 9 plus 6 is 15. Krissa needs 15 extra-large shirts.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left. We started with 50 people, and 10 of them think horse #2 will win, so:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we do:

60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we need to find out how many people think horse #12 will win. We started with 40 people who didn't think horse #2 would win, and 24 of them think horse #7 will win, so:

We have three houses that need shingles. The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. 

1. The first house needs half as many shingles as the second house.
2. The third house needs double the number of shingles as the first house.

Let's use a simple letter to represent the number of shingles the first house needs. Let's call it \( x \).

- The first house needs \( x \) shingles.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) shingles (because it's double the first house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) shingles (because it's double the first house).

Now, we add up all the shingles needed for the three houses:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya earned over the two days.

**Monday:**
- Tanya taught 4 classes and worked for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she works.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 for the day.

First, we calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we add the extra $5 for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $80 on Monday.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya taught 2 classes and worked for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour she works.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5 for the day.

First, we calculate her earnings from the hours:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned $30 on Wednesday.

**Total Earnings:**
To find out how much Tanya earned in total over the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tanya earned a total of $110 over the two days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many vanilla scents were sold in total.
   - The company has 4 different vanilla scents.
   - They sold 5 of each vanilla scent.
   - So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

2. Next, we need to find out how many fruity scents were sold in total.
   - The company has 8 different fruity scents.
   - They sold 2 of each fruity scent.
   - So, the total number of fruity scents sold is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).

3. Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.
   - We subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold.
   - So, \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, we multiply 20 by 3:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the $60 he already made from $135:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 more from selling his 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide $75 by 25:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many hours Tatiana has in total over the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. So, we add those together:
\[ 7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract the reading time from the total time:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. To find out how much time that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After playing video games, we subtract that time from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Anthony starts with 50 pencils.
2. He gives half of his pencils to Brandon. Half of 50 is 25, so he gives 25 pencils to Brandon.
3. Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
4. He then gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we calculate 3/5 of 25. 

   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]

5. So, Anthony gives 15 pencils to Charlie.
6. Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back. The museum is 150 miles away, and Jack drives at 75 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes to drive one way, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for one way:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives to the museum and then back home, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the driving time and the time spent at the museum:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many wheels Henry needs for the cars. Each car needs 4 wheels, and he has to make 57 cars. So, we do:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we need to find out how many wheels he needs for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and he has to make 73 motorcycles. So, we do:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:
276"
"Okay, so if a laptop costs $1000 and you get a 20% discount, you first need to figure out what 20% of $1000 is. 

20% of $1000 is the same as 20 out of 100 parts of $1000. To find this, you can multiply $1000 by 20 and then divide by 100. 

So, $1000 times 20 equals $20,000. Then, $20,000 divided by 100 equals $200. This means the discount is $200.

Now, to find out how much you have to pay, you subtract the discount from the original price. 

$1000 minus $200 equals $800.

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount.

800"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - These series movies cost only $6 each (since they are a sixth of the cost of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10).
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

4. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of each newer movie: $10
   - Total cost for newer movies: \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars

5. **Total cost**:
   - Total cost for series movies: $1200
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for newer movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace all movies: \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars

So, the total cost to replace all the movies is:

"Okay, let's figure out how much Winston spent at the fruit orchard.

First, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked:

1. Peaches cost $2.00 per pound. Winston picked 6 pounds, so:
   \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. Plums cost $1.00 per pound. Winston picked 8 pounds, so:
   \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. Apricots cost $3.00 per pound. Winston picked 6 pounds, so:
   \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\( \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00 \)

So, Winston spent \$38.00 on fruit.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how far the Llesis family drove and how far they hiked.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for 6 hours in total, but they also hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - So, the time they spent driving is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - To find the distance they drove, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the driving distance is:
     \[
     50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - So, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - To find the distance they hiked, we use the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the hiking distance is:
     \[
     20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points for different things:
- 10 points for every enemy they jump on
- 5 points for each berry they collect
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level

Ava does a few things differently:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma
- She collects 3 more berries than Emma
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma

Let's say:
- Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies
- Emma collects \( B \) berries
- Emma has \( T \) seconds left on the timer

Now, let's calculate Emma's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from timer: \( 30T \)
- Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

Next, let's calculate Ava's score:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries
- Ava has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
- Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
- Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
- Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
- Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

So, the difference between their scores is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of those pizzas together cost 30 dollars. So, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost, and we know they cost the same amount.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

This means the other two pizzas together cost 34 dollars. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide 34 dollars by 2:
34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, we can calculate the total number of rides for these 5 days:
- 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, on two other days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days. So, on these special days, they ride:
- 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day
- 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
- 15 rides (usual days) + 12 rides (special days) = 27 rides

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Initial Fish:**
   - Bob had 7 fish in total.
   - 3 of them were orange.
   - 4 of them were white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
   - We need to find out how many of these 17 fish were white.

3. **Final Condition:**
   - After adding the 17 fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's use some variables to help us:
- Let \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
- Let \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know two things:
1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   - The total number of white fish after buying is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish after buying is \( 3 + y \).
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To check:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how far Andy drives each day. He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much gas his car uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so for 50 miles, he uses:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much this gas costs. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much money Carrie got from the quarters. She has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, or $0.25. So, we multiply 140 by 0.25:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \]
So, the quarters are worth $35.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Carrie got from the twenties. She has 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. So, we multiply 10 by 20:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]
So, the twenties are worth $200.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find out how much that is, we multiply 200 by 3/5:
\[ 200 \times \frac{3}{5} = 200 \times 0.6 = 120 \]
So, she spent $120 from the twenties.

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount she spent:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

So, Ricardo gets 110 tomatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many eggplants he gets. Each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, we multiply 4 by 8:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
So, Ricardo gets 32 eggplants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[ 110 + 32 = 142 \]

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Samwell's store sold a total of 40 TVs this week. Out of these, one-fourth are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. We need to find out how many are OLED TVs.

1. **Find the number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of 40 TVs is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) smart TVs.

2. **Find the number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of 40 TVs is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) analog TVs.

3. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the TVs are OLED TVs. So, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs:
   - \( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \) OLED TVs.

So, Samwell's store sold 25 OLED TVs.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find the night temperature:**
   - During the day, it's 45 degrees.
   - At night, it's 33 degrees colder.
   - So, the night temperature is 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees.

2. **Determine how much the temperature needs to rise:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees.
   - The current night temperature is 12 degrees.
   - To prevent freezing, the temperature needs to rise to 32 degrees.
   - So, the temperature needs to rise by 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees.

3. **Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn:**
   - Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - To raise the temperature by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many groups of 9 people we can make from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells 9 members from one group brought back:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 groups, we multiply the number of seashells one group brought back by 6:

\[ 18 \times 6 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

- Then, 13 more people get on the train. So, we add 13 to 125:
  \( 125 + 13 = 138 \)

Now, at the next stop:
- 38 people get off the train. So, we subtract 38 from 138:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many bottle caps Damien finds in one day. He finds 10 bottle caps each day.
2. Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps he finds in a whole month. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds each day by the number of days in the month:
   \[
   10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps}
   \]
3. Now, we need to figure out how much money 300 bottle caps are worth. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
   \[
   300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Jamie made last Tuesday.

First, we need to know how much she makes for her regular hours. Jamie works 8 hours a day at $20 an hour. So, for her regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate her pay for the extra hours. Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 3 extra hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. 

To find 150% of $20:
\[ 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

So, for the 3 extra hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Now, we add the pay for her regular hours and the pay for her extra hours:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work last Tuesday.

So, the discount is $10.

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much Mike has to pay:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]
So, the sale price of the jeans is $30.

Now, if Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much change he will get back. We do this by subtracting the sale price from $50:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school!

1. **Initial number of employees**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New employees each month**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Number of months**: We need to figure out the total after 3 months.

First, let's find out how many new employees are hired in 3 months:
\[ 20 \text{ new employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ new employees} \]

Next, we add these new employees to the initial number of employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ total employees} \]

Each employee gets paid $4000 per month. So, the total salary for all employees in one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out how much the company pays in total over 3 months:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 3,120,000 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how long it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice. Since ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, singing it twice would be:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to add the time for ""Jingle Bells,"" which is 240 seconds long. So, we add 300 seconds and 240 seconds together:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time the choir will be caroling is:
540 seconds"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Billy's Starting Pay:**
   - Billy started at $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's First Raise:**
   - After 2 months, Billy got a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - So, his new pay was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, Billy got another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - So, his new pay was $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Pay:**
   - Sally started at $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting pay.
   - So, Sally's pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, he earns $11.50 × 20 = $230.
   - Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so for 20 hours, she earns $10.50 × 20 = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
   - $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so:
\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2 \text{ per loaf} = \$6 \]

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1 \text{ per bagel} = \$2 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the 3 loaves of bread cost compared to the 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half of what Pierson scored. 

Pierson scored 278 points. So, half of Pierson's score is:
278 / 2 = 139

Nikita scored 11 more than this, so:
139 + 11 = 150

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
278 + 150 = 428

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many students and teachers there are in total at Ashley's school.

1. **Number of Students:**
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has 25 students.
   - So, the total number of students is \( 40 \times 25 = 1000 \) students.

2. **Number of Teachers:**
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has 3 teachers.
   - So, the total number of teachers is \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) teachers.

Next, we need to figure out how many trees each group plants.

3. **Trees Planted by Students:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - So, the total number of trees planted by students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \) trees.

4. **Trees Planted by Teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \) trees.

Finally, we add the trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted.

5. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
   - Total trees = \( 1000 + 240 = 1240 \) trees

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many stuffed animals Bubbles has right now. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

If we add these up:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

So, Bubbles has 14 stuffed animals in total right now.

Next, we want to find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
14 + \( x \)

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of this total. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To get \( x \) by itself, we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We have two cars on a highway. The first car is going 60 miles per hour, and the second car is going 70 miles per hour. The second car passes the first car and they both keep going at their speeds.

We want to know how far apart they will be after 2 hours.

1. **First Car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second Car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

20 miles"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add up the cost of the diamond and the gold:
- The diamond costs $600.
- The gold costs $300.
- So, the total cost of the materials is $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium that James pays for the ring to be made:
- 30% of $900 is calculated by multiplying $900 by 0.30.
- 0.30 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out how much James paid:
- Total cost of materials: $900
- Premium: $270
- Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

1170"
"Okay, let's figure out the school's overall pass rate step by step.

First, we need to know how many students passed in each grade:
- For the third graders, 340 out of 500 passed.
- For the fourth graders, 40 out of 100 passed.
- For the fifth graders, the pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40. So, the fifth graders' pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80. This means 80% of the fifth graders passed. Since there are 400 fifth graders, 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Next, we add up the number of students who passed:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 320
- Total passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Now, we add up the total number of students:
- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400
- Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:
- Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

70%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has 2 bags, and each bag has 72 chips. So, we multiply:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. We know that 12 chips are needed for every square inch. So, we divide:
\[ 144 \div 12 = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much tea the four students drank. Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts. So, we multiply:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much tea the 16 students drank. Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts. So, we multiply:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Now, we add the tea that both groups of students drank:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, we add the tea that was left to the tea that was drunk to find out how much tea there was at the beginning:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. Finally, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so we divide:
   \[
   48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

At the start of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. We need to find out how many more students join by the end of May.

1. **January:** The number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
2. **February:** The number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
3. **March:** The number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
4. **April:** The number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
5. **May:** The number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. But we started with 10 students, so the number of additional students who joined is:

320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, 310 additional students joined by the end of May."
"Okay, so Felix is making money by helping kids get their stuff out of trees. He charges 25 cents for each branch he has to climb. Over the week, he made $105. We need to figure out how many branches he climbed on average each day.

First, let's find out how many branches he climbed in total. Since he made $105 and each branch costs 25 cents, we divide $105 by 25 cents (or $0.25):

\[ 105 \div 0.25 = 420 \]

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in total over the week.

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ 420 \div 7 = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed 60 branches on average each day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

But, oh no! She drops 1 of each type of flower. So, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \( 5 \text{ petals} \)
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \( 6 \text{ petals} \)
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \( 4 \text{ petals} \)
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \( 7 \text{ petals} \)

The total number of petals from the dropped flowers is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The bag has 35 marshmallows.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
3. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
4. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, we add up all the marshmallows that were used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we have 14 marshmallows left. Since there are 2 kids (John and DeSean), we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack: 240 minutes ÷ 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes ÷ 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 × 2 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can find the total amount of money spent:
68 quarters × $0.25 per quarter = $17

So, the total amount of money used is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class!

Tanya makes a salt scrub that fits into a 10-ounce jar. She uses different ingredients, and we need to figure out how much oil she uses.

1. **Citrus Zest and Fragrance**: She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. Let's call this amount \( z \) ounces.
2. **Salt and Sugar**: She uses the same amount of salt as sugar. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest. So, the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces, and the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
3. **Oil**: She uses twice as much oil as salt. So, the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients to make sure they fit into the 10-ounce jar:
- Citrus Zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the mixture is:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Now, solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

So, the amount of oil is:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \] ounces

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much John spent on the goats. He bought 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, we multiply the number of goats by the cost of each goat:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on the cows. He bought 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, we multiply the number of cows by the cost of each cow:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount John spent:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent a total of $4500.

Now, to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs. So, 63 - 48 = 15.

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, let's figure out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students must have raised the rest.

To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount:
\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

So, the students raised $125,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. So, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:
\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

1. **First Day Walking:**
   - Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

2. **Second Day Walking:**
   - On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day.
   - Half of 8 hours is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

3. **Total Time Walking:**
   - To find the total time she walked over the two days, we add the hours from both days:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Hunter saw 50 cars in the parking lot when he got to school. Then, during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, we add those together:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

So, there were 70 cars in the parking lot after the first break.

Next, during the lunch break, half of the cars left. To find out how many cars left, we divide 70 by 2:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \]

So, 35 cars left the parking lot during the lunch break.

To find out how many cars were left in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

So, Kimberly bought 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food she bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]
So, Kimberly bought 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Now, let's simplify this:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( P \). First, subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, if she had 5 green eggs, she had:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ blue eggs}
   \]
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, if she had 10 blue eggs, she had:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ pink eggs}
   \]
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, if she had 9 pink eggs, she had:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ yellow eggs}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound.
     \[
     4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The book needs to be shipped 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 for each mile.
     \[
     20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Add these two amounts to get the total shipping cost:
     \[
     1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the book's price.
     \[
     32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will get $24 back from Amazon.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Mulan has $40. Her dad gives her $100 more, so:
$40 + $100 = $140

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans. Each pair costs $30, so:
2 pairs × $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount she spends is:
$60 + $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the money she had:
$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. Here's what he makes each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up what he made in the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how much time Britany spends on each activity every week, and then we'll multiply that by 4 to get the total for a month.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, the total time spent recording videos each week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time is \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time is \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.
   - So, the total time spent doing makeup each week is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time is \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time spent on these activities in a month:
- Time spent recording videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \] minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."

   - 6 mirrors
   - 2 chandeliers
   - 20 pictures

3. **How many extra items does Angela need?**
   - Extra mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
   - Extra chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
   - Extra pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

4. **Total extra items:**
   - 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 extra items

5. **Cost for extra items:**
   - Each extra item costs $15
   - 13 extra items × $15 = $195

6. **Total cost:**
   - Base installation fee: $129
   - Cost for extra items: $195
   - Total: $129 + $195 = $324

So, the total cost for Angela will be:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Pompei's Mountain:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's Mountain:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches high.

3. **Kagiyami's Mountain:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches high.

4. **Naruto's Mountain:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches high.

5. **Convert Inches to Feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - So, \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mason is riding his bike at 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours first. So, to find out how far he goes in those 4 hours, we multiply his speed by the time:

\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he takes a rest. Then, he rides for another 6 hours. We do the same thing to find out how far he goes in those 6 hours:

\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance he traveled, we add the two distances together:

\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. This means that together, they cover the whole distance in 18 hours.

Now, if we have 4 turtles, and each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to figure out how long it will take them to cover the same distance.

1. **Find the speed of one kangaroo:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cover the distance, then one kangaroo would take 3 times as long because it's just one kangaroo doing the work of three.
   - So, one kangaroo would take \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \) hours to cross the highway.

2. **Find the speed of one turtle:**
   - Since a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take a turtle twice as long as a kangaroo to cover the same distance.
   - So, one turtle would take \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) hours to cross the highway.

3. **Find the time for 4 turtles:**
   - If one turtle takes 108 hours, then 4 turtles working together would take a quarter of that time because they are all moving at the same time.
   - So, 4 turtles would take \( \frac{108}{4} = 27 \) hours to cross the highway.

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

3. Erika has $150 from her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Now, let's add up all the money Erika has:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

So, Erika has $230 from her job and her mom. She needs $50 more to reach the price of the laptop, which is $400. This means the total amount of money she has right now is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the money from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:
\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples. One small apple gives 3 slices, and Adam has 5 small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

So, the number of apple slices left is:

Now, we add up the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 (good at both)

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

1. **Principal (P):** Brenda started with $300.
2. **Interest Rate (r):** The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, three-quarters of $300 is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]
3. **Time (t):** The investment is for 3 years.

Now, we need to find the total interest earned over 3 years. The formula for simple interest is:
\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3
\]
First, calculate \(300 \times 225\):
\[
300 \times 225 = 67500

Then, multiply by 3:
\[
67500 \times 3 = 202500

So, the total interest earned over 3 years is $202,500.

Finally, to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the interest to the principal:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we have 50 floral shirts. Out of these, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are compared to white shirts with no collars. We subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm:
- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

Next, we need to find out how much 3 baskets of red food cost before any discounts. Each basket of red food costs $18, so:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]
So, 3 baskets of red food cost $54.

Now, we need to apply the discount. You get $2 off for each basket of red food, and you're buying 3 baskets, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
So, the total discount for the red food is $6.

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]
So, after the discount, 3 baskets of red food cost $48.

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to get the total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

Now, in the third year, they count all the homes built in the first two years and double that number. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. So, in the third year, they build 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes from each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Identate the ages:**
   - I am 3 years younger than my brother.
   - I am 2 years older than my sister.
   - My mom's age is 1 less than three times my brother's age.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let's say my age is \( x \).
   - My brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
   - My sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
   - My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

3. **Write the equation for the sum of our ages:**
   - The sum of all our ages is 87.
   - So, \( x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \).

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - First, simplify inside the parentheses: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).
   - Now, put it all together: \( x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \).

5. **Combine like terms:**
   - \( x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \).
   - \( 6x + 9 = 87 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 9 from both sides: \( 6x = 78 \).
   - Divide by 6: \( x = 13 \).

So, I am 13 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. He has 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson should buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ 54 \text{ glue sticks} \div 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water. After it rains a lot, the water in the river doubles. So, on the second day, the river has 4000 gallons times 2, which is 8000 gallons. On the third day, the river gets 6000 more gallons of water. So, we add 6000 gallons to the 8000 gallons from the second day. That gives us 14000 gallons of water in the river on the third day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We start with 10 people who are infected. Each day, every infected person infects 6 more people. We need to find out how many people are infected after 3 days.

**Day 0:**
- We start with 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 more people.
- So, 10 people each infect 6 others: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Now, we have 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 more people.
- So, 70 people each infect 6 others: \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Now, we have 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 more people.
- So, 490 people each infect 6 others: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of people infected is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela got in tips. Each of the 40 customers gave her $20. So, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta got. Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta got $80 less than Rafaela. We subtract 80 from 800 to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta got $720 in tips.

Now, to find out how much they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips they both received is:

1520"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters. So, 2 oranges times 3 daughters equals 6 oranges given to her daughters.

Then, she gave 3 oranges to her only boy. 

Now, let's add up the oranges given away: 6 oranges to the daughters plus 3 oranges to the boy equals 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we subtract the oranges given away from the total oranges she bought: 12 oranges minus 9 oranges equals 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer has 3 oranges left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year, which has 12 months, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.
   - So, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge every month.
   - In one year, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire in the same time.
   - So, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges every month.
   - In one year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges:**
   - We need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

2. **Calculate how many loaves Paige baked:**
   - Paige can bake 2 loaves every hour.
   - In 5 hours, she baked \(2 \times 5 = 10\) loaves.

3. **Determine how many slices she got from all the loaves:**
   - Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
   - So, 10 loaves give \(10 \times 8 = 80\) slices.

4. **Calculate how much money she made from selling all the slices:**
   - Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50.
   - So, 80 slices sold at $0.50 each make \(80 \times 0.50 = 40\) dollars.

So, Paige raised **$40** in total."
"Okay, so if Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can figure out how many silver coins she has by subtracting 30 from 70. That gives us 40 silver coins.

   50 \times 10 = 500 \text{ burritos}
   \]

2. Next, we need to add the burritos that Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos. So, we add 20 to the 500 burritos the students got:
   \[
   500 + 20 = 520 \text{ burritos}
   \]

3. Now, we know that Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos are left over, we subtract the 520 burritos that were eaten from the 600 burritos that were ordered:
   \[
   600 - 520 = 80 \text{ burritos}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know that:
- Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let's say Anne has \( A \) books.
- Then Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books.
- And Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books (because Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn).

Now, we can write an equation for the total number of books:
\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]
\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now we can find out how many books Fawn has:
\[ F = A + 12 \]
\[ F = 16 + 12 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

1. First, we need to know how much Madeline and Keenan spend together each month. They spend $400 in total.

2. Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. To find out how much that is, we do:
   \[
   400 \times 0.60 = 240
   \]
   So, Madeline pays $240.

3. Now, we need to find out how much Keenan pays. Since the total is $400 and Madeline pays $240, we subtract:
   \[
   400 - 240 = 160
   \]
   So, Keenan pays $160 each month.

4. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends each week. We do:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, then one bottle of water costs:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. Let's calculate the total cost:

For the soda:
\[ 3 \text{ bottles} \times 3.00 \text{ per bottle} = 9.00 \]

For the water:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times 2.00 \text{ per bottle} = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

   - 80% of 10 is \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \) questions.
   - Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
   - So, she gets \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points from multiple-choice questions.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
   - 90% of 20 is \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \) questions.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and wants to sell 3/5 of them. So, we do:

\[ 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we need to find out how much money he will make from selling these 180 chickens. Each chicken sells for $50, so:

\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means the money he spent to buy the chickens plus the profit should equal the total money he makes from selling them. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} + 2000 = 9000 \]

To find the cost of the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money made:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

18 glasses / 2 = 9 glasses each

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. So, to find out how much money Sarah will get, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Sarah wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. She needs 20 meters of this new rope. So, we calculate the cost of the new rope:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her old rope:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will have 10 dollars left over after buying the new rope.

So, Melanie is 8 years old right now.

Next, we need to figure out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If she is 8 years old now, three times her age would be:

3 × 8 = 24

We need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. Since she is 8 years old now, we can subtract her current age from 24:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24 years old, which is three times her current age.

First, we need to find out how much each pack of bacon costs. Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

Next, each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs. So, the total cost for the strawberries is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

3. On Friday, they make twice as many as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday. So, they make \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \) chimichangas on Friday.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Tuesday: 125 chimichangas
- Wednesday: 125 chimichangas
- Friday: 250 chimichangas

Total chimichangas = 125 + 125 + 250 = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't be paired up. First, we need to find out how many microphones that 20% is.

20% of 50 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones can't be paired up. That means the number of microphones that can be paired up is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of microphones we can make with 40 microphones. Since each pair has 2 microphones:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. Then, he sees 2/3 of that number flying overhead. So, we need to find 2/3 of 6:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds}
   \]
3. Finally, he sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to multiply 3 by 8:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds}

Now, let's add all the birds together:
\[
6 + 4 + 24 = 34

"Okay, so Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them, so that leaves 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. She then put these 50 cookies into 5 jars, with the same number of cookies in each jar. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, you divide 50 by 5, which is 50 / 5 = 10 cookies.

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many petals all the orchids have together. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, we multiply:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, we need to find out how many petals all the daisies have together. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, we multiply:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We subtract the number of petals the orchids have from the number of petals the daisies have:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. First, we know there are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden.
2. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we need to find one-fourth of 100:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 indoor plants.

3. Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking out the indoor plants:
   \[
   100 - 25 = 75
   \]
   So, there are 75 plants left.

4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we need to find two-thirds of 75:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many are flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 flowering plants.

6. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob.
2. We also know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
3. To find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:
   \[
   \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
4. Now, we know that a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob.
5. To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:
   \[
   \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}

So, the speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second.

55 meters per second"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know the salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $3.
3. Now, we add the cost of the salad and the yogurt: $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her food every day.
5. To find out how much she spends on the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total: $11 - $9 = $2.
6. Since she eats two carrots, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2: $2 ÷ 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Mark makes per hour now. He used to make $10 an hour, but they gave him a raise of $2. So, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of hours he works in a week is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he works:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We need to figure out how much she made just from selling lemonade.

First, let's figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. We know that:
- She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, let's call this number \( J \).
- She mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so that's \( 3J \).
- She mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so that's \( 5J \).

So, the total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

We also know that Joe paid her $6 for all the times she mowed lawns. Since \( J \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (because the problem doesn't give us a different rate).

So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know she made $80 in total. To find out how much she made from selling lemonade, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tasha made $26 from selling lemonade.

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money John makes from renting his car. He gets paid $25 for each hour. So, we multiply the number of hours by the pay rate:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much profit John makes. Profit is the money he makes minus his car payment. His car payment is $500. So, we subtract:

Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana. 

First, we need to find out how much more Anis rowed. We do this by calculating 1/5 of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Now, we add those 10 miles to the 50 miles Dijana rowed to find out how far Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to get the total distance:

   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
     - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel didn't read any pages today.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages
   - Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total Soup in the Pot:**
   - The pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Family Members:**
   - Calvin (adult)
   - Calvin's wife (adult)
   - Two children

3. **Soup Consumption for Dinner:**
   - Each adult will have 1 bowl.
   - So, Calvin and his wife will use 2 adult bowls.
   - Since 1 adult bowl is the same as 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are the same as 4 child bowls.

4. **Remaining Soup:**
   - The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup.
   - After dinner, the remaining soup is 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls.

5. **Lunch for the Children:**
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child will have 1 bowl at a meal.
   - So, the 4 remaining child bowls can be divided by 2 children, which means each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- If she wants to make 20 small masks, she will need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we need to find out how much material Jo needs for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- If she wants to make 8 large masks, she will need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

- Blue shoe boxes used: 3
- Red shoe boxes used: 1/3 of 9 red shoe boxes. To find 1/3 of 9, we divide 9 by 3, which equals 3.

Now, we subtract the number of shoe boxes used from the total number Tim started with:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

Finally, we add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes to find the total number left:
- Total shoe boxes left: 4 + 6 = 10

So, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

So, Duncan was 52 years old eight years ago.

Next, we know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago \( A - 4 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is 30 years old now.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. In total, he threw 58 pieces of bologna. We know that there were 20 red balloons.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons:
- Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.
- So, \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
- \( 58 - 40 = 18 \) pieces of bologna.

Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna. To find out how many yellow balloons there are, we divide the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:
- \( 18 \div 3 = 6 \).

So, there are 6 yellow balloons.

The number of yellow balloons is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much Julia and Nadine spent in total. They bought a cake, some balloons, and ice cream.

1. The cake cost $11.
2. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen (12 balloons), we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons are in 12:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per set = 6 sets
   - 6 sets * $0.5 per set = $3
3. The ice cream cost $7 for each tub, and they bought 2 tubs:
   - 2 tubs * $7 per tub = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each had the same amount, we need to divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each of them had:
- $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they made from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the price per lollipop:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it cost to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost $0.5. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the cost per lollipop:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money the class raised, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ gerbils}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
3 \text{ cats} + 9 \text{ dogs} + 7 \text{ rabbits} + 21 \text{ fish} + 7 \text{ gerbils} = 47 \text{ pets}
\]

So, Larry has 47 pets in total!"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats 2 times 2, which is 4 slices a day.
3. Together, Abby and Josh eat 2 slices (Abby) + 4 slices (Josh) = 6 slices a day.
4. The loaf has 24 slices in total.
5. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat each day: 24 slices ÷ 6 slices per day = 4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"Okay, so Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. She adds one shell to her collection every month. We need to figure out how many shells she will have by the time she turns 10.

First, let's find out how many years she has been collecting shells:
10 years old - 5 years old = 5 years

Next, we need to know how many months are in 5 years:
5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she will have by her 10th birthday is:
60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha will have 60 shells by her 10th birthday. 

60"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Lana has 27 cups in total. She uses 15 of these cups to make cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups left for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

These 12 cups are divided into 3 rows. Each row has the same number of cups, so we divide 12 by 3:

\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]

In each row, there are 4 cups, and these 4 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. The sloth takes 4 hours for one trip down the tree, picking berries, and climbing back up. So, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours per trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick up on each trip to get a total of 24 berries. If the sloth makes 2 trips, then the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries per trip} \]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know the pool has 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his dad fill a tank with half of that water. So, we need to find half of 10,000 gallons:
\[ 10,000 \div 2 = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, the tank has 5,000 gallons of water. They use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day to water their garden. We need to find out how much water is used in 6 days:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:
\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water left in the tank.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Money Colby has for the month:**
   - Colby gets $150 from his parents to spend on movies.

2. **Costs of movies he has already seen:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10.
     - \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
   - He saw 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7.
     - \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

3. **Total cost of the movies he has already seen:**
   - \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars

4. **Cost of snacks he has already bought:**
   - He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
     - \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
   - He bought 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
     - \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

5. **Total cost of the snacks he has already bought:**
   - \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

6. **Total amount spent so far:**
   - \(106 + 24 = 130\) dollars

7. **Money left for the last day:**
   - \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars

8. **Cost for the last night:**
   - It's a Friday, so the movie ticket costs $10.
   - He wants a tub of popcorn, which costs $8.
   - He wants a box of candy, which costs $2.
   - Total cost for the last night: \(10 + 8 + 2 = 20\) dollars

9. **Can he afford the last night?**
   - Yes, he has exactly $20 left, which is enough for the movie, popcorn, and candy.

10. **Total number of movies he can see:**
    - Movies already seen: \(5 + 8 = 13\) movies
    - Additional movie on the last night: \(1\) movie
    - Total movies: \(13 + 1 = 14\) movies

So, Colby can see **14** movies in total this month.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - So, a mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \div 3 = 200 \) calories.

2. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - So, a mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \div 3 = 150 \) calories.

3. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

4. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

5. **Total calories from all the pastries:**
   - Add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories = \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"Okay, let's figure out the average number of Junebugs Rita picks off her plants each day.

First, we need to add up all the Junebugs she picked from Monday to Friday:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 times 39, which is 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 times 39, which is 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add them all together:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

First, add 39 and 78:
39 + 78 = 117

Next, add 117 and 78:
117 + 78 = 195

Then, add 195 and 48:
195 + 48 = 243

Finally, add 243 and 57:
243 + 57 = 300

So, Rita picked a total of 300 Junebugs from Monday to Friday.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far the bus went. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply 60 by 5:
\[ 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the car went. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply 30 by 8:
\[ 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

So, 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now:

62 - 48 = 14

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing it in class!

We know three things:
1. Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( L \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

From the problem, we can write these equations:
1. \( P + L + J = 100 \)
2. \( L = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = L + J \)

First, let's use the second equation to express \( L \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ L = J + 10 \]

Next, we use the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = L + J \]
Since \( L = J + 10 \), we can substitute \( J + 10 \) for \( L \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \). Let's substitute these into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now we know Jean's age is 20. Let's find Paul's age:
\[ L = J + 10 \]
\[ L = 20 + 10 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

Finally, let's find Peter's age:
\[ P = L + J \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **First, we count the balloons Maria gives to her friends:**
   - Maria has 4 friends.
   - Each friend gets 2 balloons.
   - So, \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons for her friends.

2. **Next, we count the balloons Maria has for herself:**
   - Maria has 1 balloon for herself.

3. **Now, we add the balloons Maria and her friends have at the start:**
   - Balloons for friends: 8
   - Balloons for Maria: 1
   - Total at the start: \(8 + 1 = 9\)

4. **Then, Maria's mom gives more balloons:**
   - Maria's mom gives 3 more balloons to each person.
   - There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends).
   - So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) more balloons.

5. **Finally, we add the additional balloons to the total at the start:**
   - Total at the start: 9
   - Additional balloons: 15
   - Total balloons: \(9 + 15 = 24\)

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total. We know that 10 people each donated 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also already have 10 boxes, so we add those:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tables are needed to fit all 60 boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes, so:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already has 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Zoey's total distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - So, the total distance Zoey spits is \( 40 \times 10 = 400 \) feet.

2. **Sydney's total distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - So, the total distance Sydney spits is \( 35 \times 12 = 420 \) feet.

3. **Combined total distance:**
   - To find the combined total distance, we add Zoey's and Sydney's distances together.
   - Combined total distance = \( 400 + 420 = 820 \) feet.

4. **Average total distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people (which is 2).
   - Average total distance = \( 820 \div 2 = 410 \) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets every hour.
- Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30

Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days
Total widgets = 60 * 24 * 30
Total widgets = 43,200

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days: 30

Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days
Total widgets = 45 * 24 * 30
Total widgets = 32,400

### Step 2: Calculate the total money made from selling the widgets.

Each widget sells for $6.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Total widgets: 43,200
- Price per widget: $6

Total money = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget
Total money = $259,200

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Total widgets: 32,400
- Price per widget: $6

Total money = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget
Total money = $194,400

### Step 3: Find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference in money = Total money from Widgeteer 3000 - Total money from WidgetMaster 9000
Difference in money = $259,200 - $194,400
Difference in money = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's 17 hours in total.

The hotel has two options:
1. 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos.
2. 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos.

Cameron decides to go with the 12-hour stay and pay extra for the extra hours. The extra hours cost 70 pesos each.

First, let's find out how many extra hours Cameron stays:
17 hours (total stay) - 12 hours (12-hour stay) = 5 extra hours

Now, let's calculate the cost for the extra hours:
5 extra hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Next, we add the cost of the 12-hour stay to the cost of the extra hours:
1000 pesos (12-hour stay) + 350 pesos (extra hours) = 1350 pesos

Now, let's see how much Cameron would have paid for a 24-hour stay:
1600 pesos

Finally, we find out how much money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus extra hours:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + extra hours) = 250 pesos

So, Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"Okay, let's figure out how much hay Nate needs for his livestock.

First, we need to know how much hay each type of animal needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, we calculate twice what a goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds per sheep.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats:
- There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds.
- So, the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:
- There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds.
- So, the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total amount of hay:
- Total hay = 75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much money John made this week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours. So, we multiply 50 by 6:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \]
John made 300 dollars this week.

Next, John spends 50 dollars on gas. We subtract that from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]
Now, John has 250 dollars left.

John wants to put 100 dollars in the bank. We subtract that from the 250 dollars he has left:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \]
So, John has 150 dollars left after putting money in the bank.

John buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. We multiply 5 by 10 to find out how much he spends on pencils:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \]
John spends 50 dollars on pencils.

We subtract the cost of the pencils from the 150 dollars he has left:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]
Now, John has 100 dollars left.

Finally, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens. We divide the 100 dollars he has left by the cost of one pen:
\[ 100 \div 25 = 4 \]
John can buy 4 pens.

So, the answer is:

So, Craig spelled 300 letters in total.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled. The problem says Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother spelled 350 letters in total.

Now, to find the total number of letters both Craig and his brother spelled, we add the letters Craig spelled to the letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

To find out how many children are in one school, we multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children per school} \]

Next, we need to find out how many children are in all 5 schools. We do this by multiplying the number of children per school by the number of schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children per school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, we multiply 29 by 2:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has left:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

   So, the labor charge is $78.75.
3. **Parts Charge**: The job also used $60 worth of parts.

Now, we add all these charges together:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD costs $15. So, the total cost without any discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, James gets a 40% discount on these CDs. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $150:
\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much James actually paid:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he gets $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:
50"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops.

First, we need to calculate how much she will earn from the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.5.
- So, 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.
- So, 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.

Then, we calculate the earnings from the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- So, 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.

Now, we add up all the earnings:
- Earnings from yams: $9
- Earnings from sweet potatoes: $20
- Earnings from carrots: $5
- Total earnings: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **First, figure out how far James swims initially:**
   - The lake is 20 miles long.
   - James swims 60% of the lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Next, find out how long it takes him to swim the first part:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - To swim 12 miles, it takes \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Now, calculate how long he rests:**
   - He rests for half as long as he swam.
   - Half of 6 hours is \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) hours.

4. **Then, figure out how far he has left to swim:**
   - He has already swum 12 miles.
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - So, he has \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles left to swim.

5. **Determine his new swimming speed:**
   - He swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - To swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour, it takes \( 8 \div 1 = 8 \) hours.

7. **Finally, add up all the times:**
   - Time to swim the first part: 6 hours
   - Rest time: 3 hours
   - Time to swim the remaining part: 8 hours
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours

So, it took James **17 hours** to get across the lake."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to know how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. The problem says Sam had 70 loaves.

Next, we need to find out what seven times that number is. So, we do:
7 * 70 = 490

The problem also says the bakery has 40 less than this number. So, we subtract 40 from 490:
490 - 40 = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Jasmine got 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. So, we need to subtract 7 from 15:

15 - 7 = 8

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, we add 5 to 8:

8 + 5 = 13

So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, for one copy, the commission is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, for one copy, the commission is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cayley will earn a total commission of:
15.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so we can find Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from 26:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]
So, Marcus is 21 years old.

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. If Marcus is 21, then Leo must be twice as old as Marcus:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]
So, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored the most points, and that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points.
- Azibo scored \( A \) points.
- Dinar scored \( D \) points.

From the problem, we have these clues:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)

First, let's use the second clue to find \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

Next, let's use the third clue to find \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know Bahati scored 25 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ A = 25 - 20 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The book is 1.5 inches thick, and we know that there are 100 pages in every inch of the book. Since each piece of paper has two sides, each side counts as one page.

First, we need to find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches. We do this by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

\[ 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how long Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's a total of 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert those hours into minutes because we know how many reports Vince can staple in 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Finally, to find out how many reports Vince stapled in total, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   - Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours is the same as 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - To find out how long she was sleepwalking, we subtract the start time from the end time.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time Woke Up Early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - She usually wakes up at 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Time Lost:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time lost = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total Sleep Time on the Bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time lost: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're doing a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. The problem says he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. We know he has two dozen measuring cups. 

Two dozen means:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Now, to find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract those 6 spoons from the 16 he originally had:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons left} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left. We add the remaining measuring spoons to the measuring cups:
\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
34"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many beds are already being used in the hospital. The hospital has 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, we do:

\[ 1000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 200 \]

This means 200 beds are already being used.

Next, we need to find out how many new patients are admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 new patients are admitted each day. So, we do:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

This means 700 new patients are admitted over 2 weeks.

Now, we add the number of beds that were already occupied to the number of new patients admitted:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

So, 900 beds are occupied after 2 weeks.

Finally, to find out how many beds are still unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total number of beds:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:
   \[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]
3. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to family. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]
   So, 6 emails are sent to family.
4. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending 6 to family:
   \[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]
5. One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years old

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly thinks Courtney made a mistake and said there were 20% more people than there really were. So, if we want to find out how many people were really there, we need to figure out what number, when increased by 20%, equals 48.

First, let's remember that 20% is the same as 0.20. So, if the real number of people is \( x \), then 20% more than \( x \) is \( x + 0.20x \), which is the same as \( 1.20x \).

We know that \( 1.20x = 48 \). To find \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Jason picked up 2 balls. The problem says that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried half of that, which is 1 ball.

Next, the problem also says that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 times 2, which is 4 balls.

Now, we need to find out the total number of balls that were picked up. We add up the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:

- Jordan carried 4 balls
- Jason carried 2 balls
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball

So, the total number of balls is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many holes the pirates dug each day:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes because the pirates kept falling in. So, the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's add up the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes} \]

The problem says that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since they dug 10 holes on the first day, four times that is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

So, by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. We already know there were 29 holes by the end of the third day. To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The answer is:

Collins got 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips. Now, to find out how many corn chips there were altogether, we add up all the corn chips: 140 + 85 = 225.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're doing it in middle school math class!

We know that:
1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the problem, we can write these equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify this:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
Substitute \( A = 40 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. John is watching a show where each episode is 20 minutes long. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode. So, if one episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is 20 divided by 2, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching all the episodes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, let's figure out how far the bird flew from her summer home to her winter home.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far she flew, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, the bird turns around and flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Again, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Then, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We do the same calculation:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out the total distance the bird flew south. We add the distances she flew south and subtract the distance she flew north:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Greta's Brownies:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is 12, she made 12 brownies.
   - At her office, they gave her half a dozen brownies. Half a dozen is 6, so she got 6 more brownies.
   - Her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies. Four dozen is 48, so she got 48 more brownies.

2. **Total Brownies:**
   - Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:
     \[
     12 \text{ (hers)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
     \]

3. **Brownies Eaten:**
   - During the party, 1 and a half dozen brownies were eaten. One and a half dozen is 18, so 18 brownies were eaten.

4. **Brownies Left:**
   - To find out how many brownies Greta has left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies:
     \[
     66 \text{ (total)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

So, Greta has 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that means his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find out how much younger, we calculate 25% of 8, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The fourth phone is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300

Total cost: $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how long the fence will be all the way around. This is called the perimeter. For a rectangle, you add up all the sides. Since the garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we can do this:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

First, we need to know how many states are in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Next, we need to figure out how many states India has. The problem says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we first find half of 50, which is 25. Then, we add 4 to 25, which gives us 29. So, India has 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries together:
- USA: 50 states
- India: 29 states

First, we need to add up the cost of all the books Tyler wants to buy:
- The dictionary costs $18.
- The dinosaur book costs $13.
- The children's cookbook costs $8.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Sunny made from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the weekend.

**Saturday:**
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up the total boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings:
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box, so 25 boxes * $6 = $150
- Apple pie costs $15 per box, so 21 boxes * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items:
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of $465 over the two days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Sunscreen per hour**: Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
2. **Hours outside per day**: She is outside for 4 hours each day.
3. **Total sunscreen per day**: So, she uses 1 ounce/hour × 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day.
4. **Days on vacation**: She is on vacation for 8 days.
5. **Total sunscreen for the vacation**: So, she will use 4 ounces/day × 8 days = 32 ounces.
6. **Bottle size**: Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
7. **Number of bottles needed**: To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total sunscreen by the size of each bottle: 32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 

First, we need to find out what 40% of $100 is:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we subtract $40 from $100:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

So, both cars together cost $160.

160"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Emil's Age:**
   - Emil is 19 years old now.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Emil's Dad's Age:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
   - Since this is 5 years from now, Emil's dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

3. **Emil's Brother's Age:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.
   - Since this is 5 years from now, Emil's brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

4. **Sum of Their Ages:**
   - Emil's dad is 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Adrianne's mom gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mom, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mom, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:
20 (from mom) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Thursday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. **Friday's Catch:**
   Joe caught 4 times as much as he did on Thursday. So, we multiply:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Saturday's Catch:**
   Joe caught half of what he caught on Friday. So, we divide:
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total Catch:**
   Now, we add up all the crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
   \[
   3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Number of Servings:**
   Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we need to find out how many 3-pound servings are in 21 pounds. We divide:
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7 \text{ servings}
   \]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many football players there are in Mr. Roper's class. There are 30 students in total, and 20% of them are football players. 

To find 20% of 30, we do:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]
So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 students left.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find 25% of 24, we do:
\[ 24 \times 0.25 = 6 \]
So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

So, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

1. Sophie wears size 5 boots.
2. Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's. So, we multiply Sophie's size by 5:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Charlie's boots are size 25.

3. To find the average size of their boots, we add their sizes together and then divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

So, the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide. Since 12 inches is the same as 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - So, each plant and the space between it will take up 1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (for the space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already has 17 flowers.
   - She needs 44 plants in total.
   - So, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost for 27 plants is \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \) dollars.

So, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Edgar eats 18 pretzels every day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. So, we need to find out how many pretzels that is:

First, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels each day. Now, we need to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 9 by 7:
\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how much it costs to fill one basket. 

- Each petunia costs $3.00, and Katherine wants 3 petunias in each basket. So, the cost for the petunias in one basket is:
  \[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. So, the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
  \[ 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, so we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations. So, the soil used for carnations is:
  \[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Jessica makes $2,000 a month. She saves 25% of that for fancy shoes. So, we need to find out what 25% of $2,000 is:

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

So, Jessica saves $500 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

$500 per month * 12 months = $6,000

Now, each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes:

$6,000 / $1,000 per pair = 6 pairs of shoes

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. We know she can peel 6 shrimp in one minute. So, to find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute sessions she needs to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:

\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]

Since each session takes 10 minutes, we multiply 3 by 10 to get the total cooking time:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First, the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours.**
   - On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Next, the air conditioner is turned up to high for 4 hours.**
   - On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Then, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.**
   - When the air conditioner is off, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- The room cooled down by 6 degrees on low.
- The room cooled down by 12 degrees on high.
- The room warmed up by 4 degrees when the air conditioner was off.

So, the total change in temperature is:
- \(6 + 12 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Bill's Dad's Age When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet a Second Time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw the comet.
   - So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Time Between Comet Sightings:**
   - The comet comes back every 75 years.

4. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet comes back every 75 years, then he must have seen it for the first time 75 years earlier.
   - So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Buford writes a check for the electric bill once every month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.
2. He also writes a check for the gas bill once every month. So, that's another 12 checks for the gas bill.
3. Buford writes a check to the church twice every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks for the church.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service once every quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's add all these checks together:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total checks per year: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

We have two planes at the airport. The first plane flies to different places, and the second plane only flies to Poland.

1. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips are only half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, if 44 trips are half, then the first plane must make twice as many trips:
   \[
   44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its trips. So, we need to find out how many trips that is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips to Greece}
   \]

3. The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. To find out how many trips are left:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22 \text{ trips}
   \]

4. These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so each gets half of these trips:

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - So, Chikote howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - So, Igneous howls for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howl Time:**
   - Now, we add up the howl times of all three wolves.
   - Total howl time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.

We know the total age of the four kids is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We need to find out how old Wilfred is.

First, let's add up the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is 7. Since the total age of all four kids is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred by subtracting 7 from 20:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene is twice as old as 5:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The age of Wilfred is:

Next, the bride gave half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we know that each person at the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were at the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. The watermelon needs to be divided so that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

1. **Let's say each kid's slice is \( x \) (a small piece).**
2. **Then each adult's slice is \( 2x \) (twice as big as a kid's slice).**

Now, let's figure out how many slices we have in total:

- The 4 kids get 4 slices, each of size \( x \). So, the total for the kids is \( 4x \).
- The 2 adults get 2 slices, each of size \( 2x \). So, the total for the adults is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

Adding these together, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \).

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

   - So, the total time for rounds is 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Appointments:**
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - So, the total time for appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Next, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:

- Total time spent = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

Now, we need to convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:

- 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones has 9 hours available at the clinic. So, we subtract the time he spends on rounds and appointments from his total available time:

- Time left for updating records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we need to know how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, if there are 30 female porcupines, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Now, we need to find out how many babies are born in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

\[ \boxed{1490} \]"
"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool.

First, we need to find out how much water the pool can hold. The pool is a rectangle, so we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

The pool is:
- 25 feet long
- 14 feet wide
- 4 feet deep

So, the volume \( V \) is:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

So, the number of gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ G = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon.

So, the cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 9 red sticks.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks. So, if there are 9 red sticks, then there are \(9 + 5 = 14\) blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, if there are 14 blue sticks, then there are \(14 - 3 = 11\) yellow sticks.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks: \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\)

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Matteo traveled. Matteo was driving at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far Shandy traveled. Shandy was driving at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles Shandy traveled compared to Matteo. We subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

230"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school!

1. **Total Students**: The school has 3000 students.

2. **Students Over 16**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - So, \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \) students are over 16.

3. **Male Students Over 16**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - So, \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \) male students are over 16.

4. **Female Students Over 16**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 are female.
   - So, \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \) female students are over 16.

5. **Students Under 16**:
   - The other half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - So, \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \) students are under 16.

6. **Male Students Under 16**:
   - Half of the students under 16 are male.
   - So, \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \) male students are under 16.

7. **Female Students Under 16**:
   - The rest of the students under 16 are female.
   - So, \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \) female students are under 16.

8. **Total Female Students**:
   - Add the female students over 16 and under 16.
   - So, \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \) female students in total.

So, the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so he can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany runs 10 laps, and Quinn runs 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how much water Wanda and Ms. B put into the tank each day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. The tank holds 18,000 gallons, so:
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda did. So:
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Total for the First Day:**
   - Add Wanda's and Ms. B's amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total first day} = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did on the first day. So:
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she did on the first day. So:
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Total for the Second Day:**
   - Add Wanda's and Ms. B's amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total second day} = 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
   - Add the totals from both days:
     \[
     \text{Total water pumped} = 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

6. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - The tank holds 18,000 gallons, so:
     \[
     \text{Remaining water} = 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Final Charge:**
   - At the end, the power bank had 28% charge left.

2. **Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour.
   - If we go backwards, we need to add 7% back each hour for 3 hours.
   - So, if the power bank had 28% at the end, before the last 3 hours, it had more charge.
   - We can use a formula to find out how much more: \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{\text{Final charge}}{(1 - 0.07)^3} \).
   - Plugging in the numbers: \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{28}{(0.93)^3} \).
   - \( (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804 \).
   - So, \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{28}{0.804} \approx 34.8\% \).

3. **First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - If we go backwards, we need to add 9% back each hour for 5 hours.
   - So, if the power bank had 34.8% before the last 3 hours, before the first 5 hours, it had more charge.
   - We can use a formula to find out how much more: \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{\text{Charge before last 3 hours}}{(1 - 0.09)^5} \).
   - Plugging in the numbers: \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{34.8}{(0.91)^5} \).
   - \( (0.91)^5 \approx 0.590 \).
   - So, \( \text{Charge before} = \frac{34.8}{0.590} \approx 58.9\% \).

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was about 58.9%.

58.9%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much money Janet needs to save for the down payment on the car. The car costs $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that. 

To find 20% of $10,000:
\[ 10,000 \times 0.20 = 2,000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Janet makes in a week. She earns $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total earnings per hour are:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Janet works 40 hours a week, so her total earnings per week are:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Janet to save $2,000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ 2,000 \div 1,000 = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. Here's what he's already bought:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each
- 4 pears at $0.50 each
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each
- 5 apples at $0.75 each

First, let's calculate how much he spent on each type of fruit:

- Peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Anne has a box with 15 packs of sweets. Each pack has 60 pieces. She keeps 2 packs for herself, so she gives away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in those 13 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces:

13 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne gives these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend gets, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The price of carrots starts at $120.
2. Every year, the price goes up by 5%. This means we need to add 5% of the current price to the current price each year.

Let's do this for each year:

**Year 1:**
- 5% of $120 is \( 0.05 \times 120 = 6 \)
- New price after Year 1: \( 120 + 6 = 126 \)

**Year 2:**
- 5% of $126 is \( 0.05 \times 126 = 6.30 \)
- New price after Year 2: \( 126 + 6.30 = 132.30 \)

**Year 3:**
- 5% of $132.30 is \( 0.05 \times 132.30 = 6.615 \)
- New price after Year 3: \( 132.30 + 6.615 = 138.915 \)

Now, we need to round 138.915 to the nearest whole number. 

138.915 rounds to 139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide 72 by 8:
   \[
   72 \div 8 = 9
   \]
   So, each album has 9 pictures.

2. Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums are selfies and 2 albums are portraits. We need to find out how many pictures are selfies and how many are portraits.

3. For the selfies:
   \[
   3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]

4. For the portraits:
   \[
   2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

5. To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two numbers together:
   \[
   27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures}
   \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. If he reads 18 pages, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages.

First, we divide 18 by 3:
\[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]

This means there are 6 sets of 3 pages in 18 pages. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply 10 minutes by 6:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. Then, 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so we add 7 to 91:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

John has 22 bananas."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how many easy questions there are:**
   - The quiz has 60 questions in total.
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   - To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.40:
     \[
     60 \times 0.40 = 24
     \]
   - So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. **Find out how many average and difficult questions there are:**
   - The rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions.
   - Total number of questions that are not easy:
     \[
     60 - 24 = 36

   - Since the 36 questions are divided equally:
     \[
     36 \div 2 = 18

   - So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

3. **Calculate how many questions Aries will get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then, she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The total money she made from selling the small stuffed animals is \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars. The total money she made from selling the large stuffed animals is \(12 \times x = 12x\) dollars.

The total money she made from all the sales is \(8x + 12x = 20x\) dollars. We know this total is $120.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \(x\) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

- She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she made 80 * 1 = $80 from cookies.
- She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she made 60 * 4 = $240 from cupcakes.

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters for helping her:
- She gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so she gave away 2 * 10 = $20

Finally, we subtract the $20 from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = $320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is \(24 \times 0.5 = 12\) pounds. Adding this to the 24 pounds, he can mine \(24 + 12 = 36\) pounds with a steel pickaxe.

Now, if one dwarf can mine 36 pounds in a day, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds in a day.

Finally, to find out how much they can mine in 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
\[1440 \times 30 = 43200\]

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.

2. 4 sandwiches for $6
3. 8 sandwiches, but we don't know the price yet

First, let's figure out how much each sandwich costs in the first two packages:
- For the first package: 2 sandwiches for $3 means each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50.
- For the second package: 4 sandwiches for $6 means each sandwich costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50.

So, each sandwich costs $1.50 in both packages. Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be the same for the third package too.

Now, let's find out how much 8 sandwiches would cost:
- If each sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches would cost 8 × $1.50 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Sally had 25 red balloons. A gust of wind made 40% of them burst. To find out how many burst, we do:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, 10 red balloons burst. That means she has:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]
red balloons left.

Next, Sally had 12 yellow balloons. She accidentally let go of half of them. To find out how many she let go, we do:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, she let go of 6 yellow balloons. That means she has:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
yellow balloons left.

Sally also had 7 green balloons, and none of them burst or were let go, so she still has 7 green balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and decided to take 75% of them. To find out how many she took, we do:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she took 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out the chances that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. There are a few different ways this can happen:

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. So, if a substitute comes, Marcus doesn't have to turn it in.

2. **Normal Teacher Gives an Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher comes (which is a 50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the chance of getting an extension from the normal teacher is:
     \[
     50\% \times 40\% = 20\%
     \]

3. **Normal Teacher Gives a Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension (which is a 60% chance), there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. So, the chance of getting a personal extension is:
     \[
     50\% \times 60\% \times 20\% = 6\%
     \]

Now, let's add up all the chances that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:
\[
50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\%
\]

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[
100\% - 76\% = 24\%

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many seats are left for the friends and family after giving seats to the graduates and the teachers.
   - The Fine Arts Center has 6000 seats in total.
   - 950 seats are for the graduates.
   - 300 seats are for the teachers.
   - So, the seats left for friends and family are: 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats.

2. Now, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.
   - To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we divide 4750 by 950.
   - 4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. The problem says he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat:
   \[
   75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
   \]
3. Now, it also says that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if he can eat 150 medium-sized beans, how many small beans is that? We multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:
   \[
   150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
   \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

450"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours each day for 3 days. So, we multiply 6 hours by 3 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Melissa earns from the jury duty. She gets $15 each day for 3 days. So, we multiply $15 by 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to figure out how much Melissa spends on parking. She pays $3 each day for 3 days. So, we multiply $3 by 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total parking cost from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses. We divide the money she has left by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} \div 18 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Ted buys 3 books. Each book costs $16. So, the total cost for the books is:
3 books * $16/book = $48

Next, Ted buys 3 pencils. Each pencil costs $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
3 pencils * $6/pencil = $18

Now, to find out how much Ted spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
$48 + $18 = $66

So, Ted spent a total of $66.

66"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many soda bottles Richard is going to use. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he puts a bottle every 3 feet. So, we divide 24 by 3:

\[ 24 \div 3 = 8 \]

So, Richard will have 8 soda bottles.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take him to go from one bottle to the next. He takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. But remember, he starts at the first bottle, so he only needs to move 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes for each move:

\[ 7 \times 5 = 35 \]

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples, and each box has forty apples. That means he has:

40 apples/box × 2 boxes = 80 apples

He wants to pack these apples into packs, with each pack containing eight apples. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

10"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese cost. Parmesan is $11 per pound, so:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11 \text{ per pound} = \$22
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese cost. Mozzarella is $6 per pound, so:
   \[
   3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18
   \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
   \[
   \$22 + \$18 = \$40
   \]

4. Finally, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50 Amor starts with to find out how much money she has left:
   \[
   \$50 - \$40 = \$10
   \]

So, Amor will have \$10 left to buy meat.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total Cost of College:**
   - Jim goes to college for 4 years.
   - Each year, he gets $50,000 in loans.
   - So, the total loans he gets are: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Income Lost While in School:**
   - Before college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 a year.
   - He didn't work for 4 years while in college.
   - So, the total income he lost is: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Jim Needs to Earn:**
   - The total amount Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income is: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Jim's New Income After College:**
   - After college, Jim's income is tripled.
   - His old income was $25,000 a year.
   - So, his new income is: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars a year.

5. **Time to Earn the Total Amount:**
   - To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 with his new income, we divide the total amount by his new yearly income.
   - Time needed: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money he lost from not working while in school.

4"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know the size of the bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

For the length:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

For the width:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to find out how much fabric is needed for one piece. We do this by multiplying the length by the width:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

160"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that on Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. That's easy to remember.

Next, on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of what they delivered on Monday. So, let's find one-fifth of 425:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]
Now, add 17 to 85:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, let's find twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Now, add 5 to 204:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up all the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.

736"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the chicken salad will cost. If 10 people want chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person, we multiply 10 by $6.50:
10 * $6.50 = $65.00

Next, we need to find out how much the pasta salad will cost. If 6 people want pasta salad and it costs $6.00 per person, we multiply 6 by $6.00:
6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to get the total cost:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race.
   - Twice what he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost:
- First race: $5
- Third race: $16.5
- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss: \(21.5 \div 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 per race that day.

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people live in all these cities. We know that each city has 1000 people. So, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is 48 inches. So, Xavier's new height is:
   - 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

2. Next, we need to know how tall Cole is now. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's new height is:
   - 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

3. Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights:
   - 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

1 inch"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

We have three people sharing $1920. Let's call the amount the first person gets \( x \).

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person gets \( x + 80 \).

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person gets \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we add up all the amounts to get the total of $1920:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we need to get \( x \) by itself. We do this by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person gets $420.

The share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Find out how many days the painters worked:**
   - They worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Calculate how many hours they worked each day:**
   - They worked 3/8 of a day each day.
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - So, 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours each day.

3. **Find out the total hours worked by the team:**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

4. **Determine how many hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - So, 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

Each painter worked 47.25 hours."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Rory picked up tennis balls after a match. He picked up different numbers of balls in each of the three sets. Here's what we know:

1. In the first set, he picked up 4 more balls than in the second set.
2. In the third set, he picked up half as many balls as in the second set.
3. In total, he picked up 19 balls.

Let's use a letter to represent the number of balls he picked up in the second set. We'll use \( x \).

- In the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, he picked up \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:

\[ 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38 \]

Now, let's simplify:

\[ 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory picked up 6 balls. Now, we need to find out how many balls he picked up in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school!

1. **Initial Price of the Car**: Ben bought the car for $20,000 in 2007.
2. **Depreciation Rate**: The car loses 21% of its value each year.
3. **Time Period**: We need to find the price in 2010, which is 3 years after 2007.

To find the price of the car after 3 years, we use the formula for depreciation:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Let's plug in the numbers:
- Initial Price = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years = 3

So, the formula becomes:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]

First, calculate \(1 - 0.21\):
\[ 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

Next, raise 0.79 to the power of 3:
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493 \approx 9860 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.

9860"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of these books are in English. So, 50 divided by 2 equals 25 English books.
3. Next, 10% of the books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.10, which gives us 5 German books.
4. Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   - 50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

325 kilometers/day × 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, the total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:
1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

   8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. Now, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide 240 cups by 16:
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent on her athletic gear.

1. **Tank top**: She bought a tank top for $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic socks**: The socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. So, $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10

1. First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it went up by 60%.

   To find 60% of $120:
   \[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

2. Now, we add this extra cost to the normal cost to get the new monthly cost:
   \[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

3. Finally, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does each week. 

- Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
- His washing machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

For the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin sets, and the machine can wash 2 at a time.
- So, he needs to do 4 ÷ 2 = 2 loads for the twin sheets.

For the king size bed:
- He has 1 king set, and the machine can wash 1 at a time.
- So, he needs to do 1 load for the king sheet.

Now, let's add up the loads for the week:
- 2 loads for the twin sheets + 1 load for the king sheet = 3 loads per week.

Next, we need to find out how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- 3 loads per week × 52 weeks = 156 loads per year.

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

Now, let's add the movies they watch on both days to find out how many they watch in one weekend:
- Movies on Saturday: 4
- Movies on Sunday: 2
- Total movies in one weekend: \(4 + 2 = 6\)

Next, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, we multiply the number of movies per weekend by the number of weekends:
- Movies per weekend: 6
- Number of weekends: 4
- Total movies in 4 weeks: \(6 \times 4 = 24\)

So, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

Next, we need to find out how much food the cats eat in one day. Since they are fed twice a day, we multiply the amount of food per feeding by 2:

180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food the cats eat each day:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan. The whole meal took 98 minutes to make.

First, let's say Donovan took \( D \) minutes to make his part. That means Betsy took \( D + 18 \) minutes to make her part.

The total time for both parts is 98 minutes, so we can write it like this:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's solve for \( D \):
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 18 minutes more than Donovan, so:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

58"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Hannah's doctor's visit costs in total.

1. **Cost of the cast**: The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300 per hour. So, for 30 minutes, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4. So, the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The parking is mandatory for a minimum of 2 hours, and it costs $6 per hour. So, the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
482"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. James gets 80 emails every day.
2. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we need to find out what 20% of 80 is:
   \[ 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \]
   This means 16 emails don't need a response.
3. The rest of the emails do need a response. So, we subtract the 16 emails that don't need a response from the total 80 emails:
   \[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]
   James responds to 64 emails each day.
4. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
   \[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

320"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center. 

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday. So, that's \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday. So, that's \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add all these up to find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

John took 4 tests. He got 100 on the first three tests and 80 on the fourth test. To find his average score, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

95"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. That means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, let's look at the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of these pizzas. To find 80% of 40, we do:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. That means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Now, we add the pizzas left by both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is:
14"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Find out how many big coupons Anthony is sending:**
   - Anthony is sending 700 small coupons.
   - He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons.
   - So, the number of big coupons is \( 700 \times 2 = 1400 \).

2. **Calculate the cost to mail the small coupons:**
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
   - For 700 small coupons, the cost is \( 700 \times 5 = 3500 \) cents.

3. **Calculate the cost to mail the big coupons:**
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
   - For 1400 big coupons, the cost is \( 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \) cents.

4. **Add the costs together to get the total:**
   - The total cost in cents is \( 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \) cents.
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost in dollars is \( 24500 \div 100 = 245 \) dollars.

So, Anthony spends **245 dollars** on postage in total."
"Okay, let's think this through step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. That means Sidney ordered:
10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches. So, Sidney had:
7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left

Sidney then ordered 3 more sandwiches, so now Sidney has:
3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 sandwiches is:
6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

24"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks to deliver fertiliser.
2. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
3. Two hours after they left, 1/4 of the trucks had problems and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

First, we need to find out how many trucks had problems:
- 1/4 of 20 trucks is 5 trucks (because 20 divided by 4 is 5).

Next, we need to find out how many trucks were still able to deliver the fertiliser:
- If 5 trucks had problems, then 20 - 5 = 15 trucks were still able to deliver.

Now, we need to find out how much fertiliser these 15 trucks delivered:
- Each truck carries 20 tons, so 15 trucks carrying 20 tons each would deliver 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

300"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much butter Dennis needs. He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants. So, he needs:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, let's look at the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter you buy at full price, the next pound is half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for every two pounds of butter:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter. We can break it down into three pairs of pounds:
- First pair: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
- Second pair: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
- Third pair: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Adding these up:
\[ 6.00 + 6.00 + 6.00 = 18.00 \]

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{18.00} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many people Kayla invited to her party:
- She invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- And she invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of people she invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

But, 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the number of people who will actually come to the party is:
45 - 4 = 41 people.

The movie theater charges $125 for the first 20 people. For each person after that, they charge $6 more. Since 41 people are coming, we need to figure out how many people are over the first 20:
41 - 20 = 21 people.

Now, we calculate the cost for these 21 extra people:
21 people * $6 per person = $126.

Finally, we add the base fee to the extra cost:
$125 + $126 = $251.

So, the total cost for the party is:
251"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it. A quarter is the same as 1/4. So, we need to find out what 1/4 of 60 is:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]
Maggie spent $15, so she has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60, but she spent one-third of it. One-third is the same as 1/3. So, we need to find out what 1/3 of 60 is:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]
Riza spent $20, so she has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining money:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left together.

85"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, and these bananas are enough to feed his three monkeys for a whole week. That means the monkeys eat all 315 bananas in 7 days.

2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week, the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Now, let's add up the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
   \[
   70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. The total number of bananas is 315. So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

6. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by 7:
   \[
   147 \text{ bananas} \div 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Teddy first finished half of a 500-piece puzzle. Half of 500 is 250 pieces. Then, he finished another whole 500-piece puzzle. So, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles together:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

So, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

750"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Jenny spent on the roses. She bought 15 roses. We know that:
- A dozen (12) roses cost $15.
- Each rose costs $2.

So, for 15 roses:
- 12 roses cost $15.
- The remaining 3 roses cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of 15 roses is:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much money Jenny had. She had five 5-dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the change she should get back:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the 4 dollars into quarters. Each dollar is worth 4 quarters, so:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

16"
"Okay, let's figure out how much money Terry made by selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, we need to find out how much he made from the milkshakes:
- He sold 6 milkshakes.
- Each milkshake costs $5.50.
- So, the total from milkshakes is 6 times $5.50, which is $33.00.

Next, let's calculate the money from the burger platters:
- He sold 9 burger platters.
- Each burger platter costs $11.
- So, the total from burger platters is 9 times $11, which is $99.00.

Finally, let's figure out the money from the sodas:
- He sold 20 sodas.
- Each soda costs $1.50.
- So, the total from sodas is 20 times $1.50, which is $30.00.

Now, we add up all the money he made:
- Total from milkshakes: $33.00
- Total from burger platters: $99.00
- Total from sodas: $30.00

So, the total amount of money Terry made is $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.

"Okay, let's figure out how long Paul has to wait for his train. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
   - It stays at the station for 20 minutes.
   - So, the first train leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - So, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 145 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many toothpicks Melanie has already. She saves 10 toothpicks each week, and she's been doing this for 12 weeks. So, we multiply 10 by 12:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \]
So, Melanie has 120 toothpicks so far.

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has from 200:
\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \]
So, Melanie needs 80 more toothpicks.

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 more toothpicks. We divide 80 by 10:
\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \]
So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - To find 75% of $2000, we multiply: \( 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \).
   - So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. **Find out how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
   - To find 120% of $1500, we multiply: \( 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \).
   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

3. **Calculate the discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid: \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \).

4. **Find the percentage discount:**
   - To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and then multiply by 100:
   - \( \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \).

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. We know that:
- 1 hour has 60 minutes.
- 1 minute has 60 seconds.

So, to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours, we do:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we know that one spring makes 1 jellyfish every second. So, in 14400 seconds, one spring would make:
\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Now, if we have 5 springs, each making 14400 jellyfish, the total number of jellyfish would be:
\[ 5 \text{ springs} \times 14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

Binkie's score is 90. The problem says that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, first, we need to find out what twice Binkie's score is:

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we add 15 to 180 to get Frankie's score:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. James starts walking to the store, which is 4 miles away.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. Then he realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. After getting back home, he walks the full 4 miles to the store.

So, let's add up all the miles he walked:
- 2 miles to the halfway point
- 2 miles back home
- 4 miles to the store

Total distance walked: 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny got. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, we multiply:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost if Jenny bought these bananas one by one. Each banana costs $0.80, so:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's see how much it cost her to buy the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, and she bought 10 bunches, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split. Harry is supposed to get 60 feet more than Sam. We need to figure out how much fence Sam gets.

First, let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.

Now, we know the total amount of fence is 100 feet. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ S + S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( S \). We do this by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can figure out how much it grows each year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years. That gives us:

8 inches ÷ 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, if the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, we can find out how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying 2 inches by 13 years:

2 inches/year × 13 years = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Marcel made from selling bikes in a month. Here's what we know:

- Marcel sells three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking.
- The price of an MTB is $500.
- A BMX bike costs half as much as an MTB, so it's $250.
- A Trekking bike costs $450.
- In one month, Marcel sold 300 bikes in total.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
- The rest were MTB bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**:
   - Half of 300 bikes is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

2. **BMX bikes**:
   - 15% of 300 bikes is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

3. **MTB bikes**:
   - The rest of the bikes are MTB bikes.
   - Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = MTB bikes.
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, let's calculate how much Marcel made from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   - \( 105 \) MTB bikes \(\times\) $500 each = \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
   - \( 45 \) BMX bikes \(\times\) $250 each = \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars.

3. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**:
   - \( 150 \) Trekking bikes \(\times\) $450 each = \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings:

- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
- Total earnings = \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars.

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes in one day. The farmer makes 5 bales every hour. Since the farmer works for 6 hours, we multiply 5 bales by 6 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many bales the truck picks up in one day. The truck picks up 3 bales every hour. Since the truck works for 6 hours, we multiply 3 bales by 6 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many classes John has in a week. He has 6 periods each day, plus 2 extra classes. So, each day he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes} \]

He goes to school 5 days a week, so the total number of classes in a week is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ classes/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ classes/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, John spends an extra 1/16 of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday. First, we need to find out what 1/16 of 1600 minutes is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

He spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, so the total extra time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra weekend time to the regular class time to get the total time John spends learning each week:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how high the ball is dropped from. The problem says the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, we multiply the number of stories by the height of each story:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball is dropped from 72 feet.

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce. The problem says the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height. So, we multiply the starting height by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

So, after the first bounce, the ball reaches 48 feet.

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its height after the first bounce. So, we multiply the height after the first bounce by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, after the second bounce, the ball reaches 32 feet.

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many bags of apples the orchard sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, and they sold 2000 apples, we divide 2000 by 10:

\[ 2000 \div 10 = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they made. Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned $1000.

1000"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. First, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if the triceratops weighed \( x \) kilograms, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. Next, the velociraptors came and ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( \frac{x}{2} \), which is \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means there were \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms left after the velociraptors.

3. Finally, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. So, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the triceratops weighed 1080 kilograms before the T-Rex ate it.

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to paint the room.

First, we need to find out how much area we need to paint. The room has four walls:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.

Let's calculate the area of each pair of walls:

1. **North and South Walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **East and West Walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint we need. One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.

- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each gallon of paint costs $12.

- Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

So, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

144"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Total Sodas:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - 3 of these sodas are shaken, and 9 are not shaken.

2. **After Ellen Takes a Soda:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Now, there are 11 sodas left.
   - 3 of these are still shaken, and 8 are unshaken.

3. **After Ellen's Brother Takes Some Sodas:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas left.
   - 2 of these are shaken, and 6 are unshaken.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - We need to find the chance that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda.
   - There are 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas.
   - The probability is 2 out of 8, which is the same as 1 out of 4.

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To find the percentage, we take 1 out of 4 and multiply by 100.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \)

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

25%"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a problem in math class.

We have two trains starting from the same place but going in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles an hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles an hour.

First, let's figure out how far each train goes in 3 hours:
- The first train: 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles
- The second train: 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, since they are going in opposite directions, we add the distances together to find out how far apart they are:
- Total distance apart: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

270"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. **Count the total days:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
   - So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

2. **Calculate the days Billy takes off:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   - 20% of 50 days is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

3. **Calculate the days Billy works:**
   - If he takes 10 days off, then he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. **Calculate how many people Billy helps each day:**
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day.
   - So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

5. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps:**
   - If he works 40 days and helps 6 people each day, then he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

So, Billy helps **240 people** in total."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many people the buses can carry. There are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people. So, we multiply 12 by 35:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, we need to find out how many people the cars can carry. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people. So, we multiply 20 by 3:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the number of people the buses can carry to the number of people the cars can carry to get the total number of people:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

So, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

   So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Jeff is 30 years old."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Biggest Slide:**
   - The slide is 300 feet long.
   - People slide down at 60 feet per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to slide down, we divide the length by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Biggest Slide:**
   - The slide is 240 feet long.
   - People slide down at 80 feet per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to slide down, we divide the length by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Difference in Time:**
   - Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
   - We subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes two 15-minute breaks, which add up to 30 minutes (15 minutes + 15 minutes).

So, each day, Bobby spends:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 30 minutes for breaks

That's a total of 60 minutes each day, which is the same as 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days.

- If Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks, then over 5 days, he spends:
- 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

3. Now, we add the miles that Amber and Micah ran together:
   \[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]
4. The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:
   \[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. **Return**: She returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we need to subtract $15.00 from $85.00.
   - $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
   - Now, her balance is $70.00.

3. **Frying Pan**: The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   - First, find 20% of $20.00: 
     - 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00
   - Subtract the discount from the original price:
     - $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   - So, the frying pan costs $16.00.

4. **Set of Towels**: The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00.
   - First, find 10% of $30.00:
     - 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00
   - Subtract the discount from the original price:
     - $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
   - So, the set of towels costs $27.00.

5. **New Balance**: Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance.
   - $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large. This means if we have \( T \) jellyfish in total, then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Next, we're told that a third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue when the UV light is on. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{T}{5} \), which is \( \frac{T}{15} \).

We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

1. **First, figure out how much money Lauren needs each year for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars per year.

2. **Next, calculate how much money Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - She needs $40,000 each year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. **Now, figure out how much money Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary.
   - Her salary is $100,000.
   - So, 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars per year.

4. **Finally, calculate how many years Lauren needs to save to reach $800,000:**
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If 40% of the school population is boys, and there are 240 boys, we can figure out the total number of students in the school.

First, we need to find out what 1% of the school population is. Since 40% is 240 boys, we can divide 240 by 40 to find 1%:
\[ 240 \div 40 = 6 \]

So, 1% of the school population is 6 students. To find the total number of students, we multiply 6 by 100 (since 100% is the whole school):
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Now, we know there are 600 students in total. If 240 of them are boys, the rest must be girls. So, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Next, let's see how many miles she will hike in the whole month:
\[ 250 \text{ miles per day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal of 9,300 miles:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the extra miles by the number of days in June:

- He buys 1 more female guppy, so now he has 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfish, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfish.
- He buys 3 more female goldfish, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfish.

Next, we add up all the male and female fish:

- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how far John drives one way to visit his parents. We know he drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for one way:

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out the total distance for a round trip. Since he drives 140 miles to get there and 140 miles to get back, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} + 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to find out how many miles he drives in a month. We multiply the round trip distance by 2:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

560 miles"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Sofie is going to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. So, we need to figure out how many miles she will walk in total. We do this by multiplying the number of miles she walks each day by the number of days:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Now, the problem says that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. So, we need to find half of 70 miles:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many toys the first four workers made. We know that:
- Two workers make 6 toys each hour.
- Two workers make 4 toys each hour.
- They all work for 10 hours.

So, let's calculate how many toys the first two workers made:
- Each of these two workers makes 6 toys per hour.
- In 10 hours, each of them makes \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Since there are two of them, together they make \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate how many toys the other two workers made:
- Each of these two workers makes 4 toys per hour.
- In 10 hours, each of them makes \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Since there are two of them, together they make \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's add the toys made by all four workers:
- Total toys made by the four workers: \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total, but by the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys. This means they have already made:
- \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the four workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made the rest:
- Toys made by the fifth worker: \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so to find out how many toys they made per hour, we divide the total number of toys by the number of hours:
- Toys per hour: \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

Elijah has two dogs:
- One dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. So, we need to find one-fourth of 60 pounds:
  \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

- The other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, we need to find half of 60 pounds:
  \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs:
- Kory's dog: 60 pounds
- Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
- Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

Total weight:
\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle in math class.

1. First, we know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So if Seth had \( S \) stickers, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of the stickers he got from Seth. So Luis used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. After using half, Luis gave the rest to Kris. The rest is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. So Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
5. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
6. To find \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4:
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many M&M's John has in total. He buys 3 large bags, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&M's is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's. So, the total number of M&M's is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:
\[ 900 \text{ M&M's} \div 10 \text{ M&M's per small bag} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, John can make 90 small bags.

\[ 40,000 \div 2 = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ 20,000 \div 400 = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

   \[
   120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply 600 by 1.25:

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Liam is 16 years old now.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. The problem says that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if Vince was \( V \) years old two years ago, then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Total eggs painted by everyone:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 eggs in total.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Find out how many eggs Sarah painted:**
   - Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \) eggs.
   - So, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

4. **Find out how many eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs.
   - So, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( 2A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by everyone is 56.
   - So, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).
   - Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2A = 26 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( A = 13 \).

6. **Find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:
\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]
So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

Next, since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Now, let's find out the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, we need to find out the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to get the total weight:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound:
\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

First, John has an 80-foot tree. But he can only use 80% of it for logs. So, we need to find out how much of the tree he can actually use:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, John cuts the 64 feet of usable tree into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he gets, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks. So, we need to find out how many planks he gets from 16 logs:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

3. Together, Valerie and her brother earn:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]
4. Their mother earns twice what Valerie and her brother earn together, so:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]
5. Now, to find out how much they all earn together, we add up Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's earnings:

1. **First, we need to figure out how fast Grandma walks on the beach.**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles in 40 minutes, which means she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes.

2. **Next, we need to figure out how fast Grandma walks on the sidewalk.**
   - The problem says she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk.
   - If she walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach, then on the sidewalk, she walks 1 mile in half that time, which is 10 minutes.

3. **Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.**
   - Since she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk, it takes her 10 minutes to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.

4. **Finally, we add the time she spends on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time.**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Jane saves $4 every week. She has been saving for 8 weeks already. So, we need to figure out how much she has saved so far. We do this by multiplying the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks she has been saving:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jane has saved $32 so far. Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 each week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28. We do this by dividing the amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds. So, we just have:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Now, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has right now. If adding 24 marbles makes 60, we can find out how many marbles Bob has by subtracting 24 from 60:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob has 36 marbles right now.

Next, the problem asks what happens if Bob loses 10 marbles. If Bob has 36 marbles and he loses 10, we subtract 10 from 36:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is at an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug with 1 ounce from the other mug, and the mixed water is now at least 40 degrees. We need to find out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug.

First, let's set up the problem. We know:
- The temperature of the first mug (33 degrees).
- The volume of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- The volume of water from the second mug (1 ounce).
- The final temperature of the mixed water (at least 40 degrees).

We can use a formula to find the final temperature when mixing two different temperatures of water:
\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(\text{Volume of Water 1} \times \text{Temperature of Water 1}) + (\text{Volume of Water 2} \times \text{Temperature of Water 2})}{\text{Total Volume of Water}} \]

Let's plug in the values we know:
\[ 40 \leq \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \]

Now, let's solve for \( T_2 \):
1. Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the denominator:
\[ 40 \times 5 \leq (4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2) \]
\[ 200 \leq 132 + T_2 \]

2. Subtract 132 from both sides to isolate \( T_2 \):
\[ 200 - 132 \leq T_2 \]
\[ 68 \leq T_2 \]

So, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

First, we need to know how many cows and chickens Melanie's father starts with:
- He starts with 50 cows.
- He also starts with 20 chickens.

Next, we need to find out how many cows and chickens are added each day:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows every day.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens every day.

Now, we need to calculate how many cows and chickens are added over three weeks. Three weeks is the same as 21 days (since 1 week = 7 days, and 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days).

For the cows:
- 20 cows are added each day.
- Over 21 days, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

For the chickens:
- 10 chickens are added each day.
- Over 21 days, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number added over the 21 days:
- Total cows after 21 days: 50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows.
- Total chickens after 21 days: 20 initial chickens + 210 added chickens = 230 chickens.

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

First, we need to find out how much Russell spends on 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and he buys 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]
So, the total cost before the discount is $40.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 10% of $40.00:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]
So, the discount is $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Russell actually pays:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]
So, Russell pays $36.00 for 4 packs of bagels.

Each pack has 9 bagels, and he bought 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]
So, Russell has 36 bagels.

To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total amount he paid by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]
So, each bagel costs $1.00.

The cost per bagel is:

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's break that down:

- 3 less than 6 potatoes is:
  \[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- 1 less than 3 scoops is:
  \[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a simple ratio:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

5 eggs/day × 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

First, we know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of people on the bus is 84.

To find out how many men and women there are, we need to add the parts of the ratio together:
5 (men) + 9 (women) = 14 parts

Now, we divide the total number of people by the total number of parts to find out how many people each part represents:
84 ÷ 14 = 6 people per part

Next, we multiply the number of parts for men and women by the number of people each part represents:
- Number of men: 5 parts × 6 people per part = 30 men
- Number of women: 9 parts × 6 people per part = 54 women

Now, 20 women get off the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of women who got off from the total number of women:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to find out how many individual sunflowers Faraday sells each day. He sells each sunflower for $2 and makes $26 from selling them. So, we divide the total money he makes by the price of one sunflower:
\[ \text{Number of individual sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets he sells each day. Each bouquet costs $8 and he makes $56 from selling them. So, we divide the total money he makes by the price of one bouquet:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets he sells each day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers in bouquets per day} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we add the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold each day:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days. We multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

   - 60% of 20 rocks is \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) rocks.

3. **How much money does he make from selling the rocks?**
   - He sells each rock for $7.
   - So, the money he makes from selling 12 rocks is \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \) dollars.

4. **How much money did he spend to buy the rocks?**
   - He bought 20 rocks at $5 each.
   - So, the total cost is \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) dollars.

5. **How much money does he lose?**
   - He spent $100 to buy the rocks.
   - He made $84 from selling the rocks.
   - So, the loss is \( 100 - 84 = 16 \) dollars.

Therefore, Adam loses $16.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many days Lauren needs to draw all the large-sized picture scenes. She can draw 5 large scenes each day, and she needs to draw 45 large scenes. So, we divide 45 by 5:
\[ 45 \div 5 = 9 \]
So, it takes her 9 days to draw all the large scenes.

Next, we need to find out how many days she needs to draw all the medium-sized picture scenes. She can draw 6 medium scenes each day, and she needs to draw 36 medium scenes. So, we divide 36 by 6:
\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]
So, it takes her 6 days to draw all the medium scenes.

Finally, we need to find out how many days she needs to draw all the small-sized picture scenes. She can draw 7 small scenes each day, and she needs to draw 49 small scenes. So, we divide 49 by 7:
\[ 49 \div 7 = 7 \]
So, it takes her 7 days to draw all the small scenes.

Now, we add up all the days:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \]

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"Okay, so Chatty has three dozen eggs. A dozen is 12, so three dozen is 3 times 12, which equals 36 eggs. She wants to give these eggs to her four children, and she wants to give them the same number of eggs each. To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. So, 36 eggs divided by 4 children equals 9 eggs per child.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days.
2. Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food every day.
3. So, for one day, Jen spends 3 fish * $1/fish = $3 on food.
4. For the whole month of May, Jen spends $3/day * 31 days = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on fish food in the month of May.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Patricia had 30 roses. Then, she gave 24 of them to her mom. So, we need to subtract 24 from 30:
30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Next, Patricia bought 15 more roses. So, we add 15 to the 6 roses she had left:
6 + 15 = 21 roses.

So, Patricia has 21 roses now.

First, we need to find out how far Sid traveled in total. He went 110 miles and then 140 miles. So, we add those together:
110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, we need to know how long he was traveling. He traveled for 2 hours and then 3 more hours. So, we add those times together:
2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

So, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we know that Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means if you play this ticket 100 times, you might win about 20 times.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has:
\[ 20\% \times 3 = 60\% \]
This means the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning.

Now, we want to find out the chance that both tickets win. To do this, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. The problem says Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, to find out how many seashells Carlos collected, we subtract 5 from 27:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]
So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, the problem tells us that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we divide Carlos's seashells by 2:
\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]
So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
\[ 27 \text{ (Jim)} + 22 \text{ (Carlos)} + 11 \text{ (Carrey)} = 60 \]
So, they collected a total of 60 seashells.

Finally, they divided the seashells equally among themselves. To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

So, each person got 20 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 weekend days, so:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know the first song is 5 minutes long. That's easy to remember.

Next, the second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how long the second song is, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and then add that to 5 minutes.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. Now, we add those 3 minutes to the 5 minutes of the first song:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:

Next, we need to find out how many devices he bought in total. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. So, the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying these devices. Each device costs $20, and he bought 6 devices, so the total cost is:
\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to find out how much money he made from selling all the devices. Each device is sold for $40, and he sold 6 devices, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 6 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus made after selling all the mobile devices is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **First, figure out how many bottles one person needs for their whole day:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - So, to cover 100%, we need 5 bottles (because 100% ÷ 20% = 5).

2. **Next, calculate how many bottles 2300 people need for their whole day:**
   - If one person needs 5 bottles, then 2300 people need:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Now, see how many bottles Hortex already produces:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles every day.

4. **Finally, find out how many more bottles are needed:**
   - To meet the needs of 2300 people, we need 11500 bottles.
   - Hortex already produces 4200 bottles.
   - So, the additional bottles needed are:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

1. **First, figure out how many babies are dressed in each color:**
   - Carla has 8 babies in total.
   - 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies are dressed in purple.
   - 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue. So, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies are dressed in blue.

2. **Next, figure out how many babies are wearing bows:**
   - All the blue-dressed babies wear bows. So, 2 babies in blue wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the purple-dressed babies wear bows. So, \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) babies in purple wear bows.

3. **Now, count the total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Total babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

4. **Determine how many of the babies wearing bows are dressed in purple:**
   - 2 babies wearing bows are dressed in purple.

5. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - The chance is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies with bows.
   - So, \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

6. **Convert this fraction to a percentage:**
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

1. The IRS got 5168 tax reports last week.
2. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports.
3. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports.

To find out how many reports they got on Wednesday, we need to:
- Add the reports from Monday and Tuesday to the reports from Thursday and Friday.
- Then, subtract that total from the number of reports they got all week.

So, let's add:
1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

Now, let's subtract:
5168 (total for the week) - 4043 (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1125

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sells 40 square meters. Now he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.
3. After a month, he sells another 1/4 of his original land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sells 20 square meters. Now he has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.
4. Finally, he sells the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he made:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

2. Next, let's see how many eggs each person found:
   - Lamar found 5 eggs.
   - Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}

   - Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}

3. Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:
   \[
   5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two. To find 60% of 400, we do:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the third complex has:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's add up all the apartments John collects garbage from:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:

1. **5-year-old tree**: It produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: It produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree. So, 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: It produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree. So, 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so let's call it \( x \). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \( x - 200 \) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: It doesn't produce any fruits. So, 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: It produces 20 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree. So, 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we know the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces:
1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Let's add up all the fruits produced from age 5 to age 10:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, let's say the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters long. The problem tells us that the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters long. It also says the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters long.

Now, we know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Let's simplify this equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( B \). First, subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the red rope is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

Next, both Ronnie and Rissa gave some money to their little sister. Let's call the amount they each gave \( x \).

After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. The problem says that Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. So, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Now, let's solve the right side of the equation:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 12 from 15:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, \( x = 3 \). This means both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie originally had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

First, add 3 and 6:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Next, add 9 and 12:

To find 20% of 100, we do:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \] pods.

Next, we need to find out how much each pod costs in the special size box. The special size box costs $12, and it has 120 pods. So, the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \] dollars per pod.

Now, we want to know how many pods we can get for $1. Since each pod costs $0.10, we can get:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \] pods for $1.

Since we use 1 pod per dishwashing cycle, we can run:

   - To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20.
   - \( 1000 \div 20 = 50 \)
   - So, Thomas has 50 $20 bills.

2. **He loses 10 of these $20 bills.**
   - If he loses 10 bills, we subtract 10 from 50.
   - \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
   - Now, Thomas has 40 $20 bills left.

3. **He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.**
   - Half of 40 is 20.
   - \( 40 \div 2 = 20 \)
   - So, he uses 20 $20 bills to pay the bill.
   - After paying the bill, he has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) $20 bills left.

4. **Thomas then triples his money.**
   - The value of the 20 $20 bills is \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
   - Tripling this amount means multiplying by 3.
   - \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) dollars.

5. **He converts all his money to $5 bills.**
   - To find out how many $5 bills he gets, we divide $1200 by $5.
   - \( 1200 \div 5 = 240 \)
   - So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. **Starting Chalk Length:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - To find out how much chalk was used, we calculate 45% of 5 inches:
     \[
     5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

3. **Remaining Chalk After Monday:**
   - To find out how much chalk is left after Monday, we subtract the used chalk from the starting length:
     \[
     5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - So, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

4. **Chalk Usage Each Day After Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - This means 80% of the chalk is left each day.

5. **Calculate the Remaining Chalk for Each Day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     \[
     2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     \[
     2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]

6. **Determine When the Chalk is Less Than 2 Inches:**
   - After 1 day (Tuesday), the chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days (Wednesday), the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on the varsity team.

1. There are 12 girls in Miss Albert's class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls}
   \]

2. There are 12 boys in Miss Albert's class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys}
   \]

Next, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many students are not on varsity. There are 24 students in total (12 girls + 12 boys):
\[
24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students on varsity} = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we know James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 of these teeth.
3. The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. Now, we add the teeth drilled and the teeth capped to find out how many teeth the dentist fixed in total: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

50%"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus bought and how much it cost. He bought 4000 gallons of milk, and each gallon costs $3.5. So, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

This means Mr. Marcellus paid $14,000 for the milk.

Next, we need to find out how much of the milk was expired. The problem says that 2/5 of the milk was expired. To find out how many gallons were expired, we multiply the total gallons by 2/5:

4000 gallons * 2/5 = 1600 gallons

So, 1600 gallons of milk were expired.

Now, we need to find out how much money Mr. Marcellus should get back for the expired milk. We multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon:

1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600

So, Mr. Marcellus should get a refund of $5,600.

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

We have two people, Wendy and Colin. We need to figure out how old Colin is right now.

1. **First Clue:**
   - Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - If Colin is \( C \) years old now, then in seven years, he will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
   - So, Wendy's age \( W \) is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

2. **Second Clue:**
   - In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - If Colin is \( C \) years old now, then in 25 years, he will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
   - So, \( C + 25 \) is equal to \( \frac{1}{3} \times W \).

Now, let's write these clues as equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( C \). Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Then, subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is 20 years old right now.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500. So, let's find out how much one book costs:

\[ \text{Cost of one book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is buying these books for 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books for each school.

1. First, two apples fell out of the tree. One of them landed on Newton's head.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree.
3. When he threw the apple into the tree, 5 more apples fell out.
4. Now, Newton picked up these 5 apples, plus the one he had left on the ground, making 6 apples in total.
5. He put 5 of these apples in his pocket and threw the last one at the tree.
6. This time, 6 more apples fell out of the tree.
7. Newton picked up all 6 of these apples and went home.

Now, let's count how many apples Newton has in his pocket:
- He put 1 apple in his pocket from the first two apples.
- He put 5 apples in his pocket from the 6 apples that fell the second time.
- He picked up 6 more apples, but he didn't put any of these in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

First, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

1. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
   - So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
     \[
     6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
   - So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
     \[
     6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}
     \]

Next, we need to figure out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

3. **Cheese Pizza:**
   - Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
   - To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

4. **Pepperoni Pizza:**
   - Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to get the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay actually has after one hour. He makes 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times in one hour. So, 2 times 4 equals 8 snowballs that melt in one hour.

Now, if Jay makes 20 snowballs and 8 melt, he ends up with 20 minus 8, which is 12 snowballs after one hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs. If he makes 12 snowballs in one hour, we can divide 60 by 12 to find out how many hours it will take. 

60 divided by 12 equals 5.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

4. The problem says that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
5. If John was 8 years old and he was twice as old as Jim, then Jim must have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack, which has 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they gained 50 - 38 = 12 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - They didn't order any more bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they lost 28 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack of bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   - They ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they gained 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total change over the three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that before all these changes, they must have had:
78 - 59 = 19 bandages

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Next, we need to find out how much Jen makes in a week. Jen works 6 days a week, so we multiply her daily earnings by 6:
\[ 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Jen makes in a month. April has 4 weeks, so we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

First, we need to find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John bought 10 bottles for $600. So, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many bottles of cognac John bought. The problem says he bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The problem says each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, we add 50% of the cost of a bottle of scotch to the cost of a bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for all the bottles of cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spent in total:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spent a total of 2400 dollars."

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We need to find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge.

The problem says that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40."" Let's break that down:

1. First, let's call the number of coffee mugs \( x \).
2. Four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x \).
3. Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x + 8 \).

According to the problem, this equals 40:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after we take out the ones with red stripes:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we're told that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we need to find out how many fish that is:

\[ \text{Fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total:

\[ \text{Total fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."

8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from makeup sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
\]

Next, we need to account for the colors that are no longer available:

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which has 4 colors. So, we subtract those 4 colors:
  \[
  26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 is 3 colors. We subtract those 3 colors:
  \[
  22 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 19 \text{ colors}
  \]

So, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
19

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

1. **Mattison's Height**: Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. **House Height**: The house is 7 times as high as Mattison. So, we multiply Mattison's height by 7:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the house is 420 inches tall.

3. **First Floor Height**: The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison. So, we multiply Mattison's height by 3:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the first floor is 180 inches tall.

4. **Second Floor Height**: To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
   \[
   420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many shells the Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we do:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]
So, the Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after the Alphas found theirs:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]
So, there are 420 shells left.

Now, The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we do:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]
So, The Finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells the Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by the Alphas and The Finders from the total:
\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the Gogetters found 168 shells.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles each per day. So, if we add up all the miles the dogs need to walk, it should be:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much money John gets from the loan. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan for 40% of that. So, we calculate:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, John uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. We need to find out how much that is:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

Now, to find out how much money John has left, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.

First, we need to add up the weight of all the tunas Deandre caught:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

So, the total weight is:
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Next, we need to find out how much money Deandre will make. We know that 1 kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kilograms * $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much Trinity sells the magazines for. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. If she bought them for $72, we need to multiply 72 by 11/8.

2. To do this, we can break it down:
   - 72 * 11/8 = 72 * 1.375 (since 11/8 is the same as 1.375)
   - 72 * 1.375 = 99

So, Trinity sells the magazines for $99.

3. Now, to find her profit, we subtract the price she bought the magazines for from the price she sold them for:
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price
   - Profit = $99 - $72
   - Profit = $27

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class!

First, we need to know how much water the dehumidifier removes at each setting:
- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so that's 4 liters per day.

Now, let's see how much water it removes over the days Brian used it:
- For the first 3 days, it was on the low setting. So, it removed 1 liter/day × 3 days = 3 liters.
- For the next 3 days, it was on the medium setting. So, it removed 2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters.
- For the last 5 days, it was on the high setting. So, it removed 4 liters/day × 5 days = 20 liters.

Finally, we add up all the water removed:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:
29 liters"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many water balloons they had at the start. They filled up 10 packs, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 by 30:
   \[
   10 \times 30 = 300
   \]
   So, they started with 300 water balloons.

2. By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:
   \[
   300 - 12 = 288

First, we need to know how much medicine Saanvi uses for one dose. She uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

So, for the second medicine:
3 times 14 mL = 42 mL

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to get the total for one dose:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali teaches one class.
   - His class can hold 120 students.
   - So, the total number of students Ali's school can hold is 120.

2. **John's School:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's classes can hold 1/8 of the number of students in Ali's class.
   - First, we need to find out how many students 1/8 of 120 is:
     \[
     \frac{120}{8} = 15
     \]
   - So, each of John's classes can hold 15 students.
   - Since John has two classes, the total number of students John's school can hold is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30
     \]

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - To find the total number of students both schools can hold together, we add the capacities of both schools:

1. **Find out how much Stephen owes with the interest:**
   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to pay back an extra 2% of $300.
   - To find 2% of $300, we do: \( 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \).
   - So, the total amount Stephen owes is: \( 300 + 6 = 306 \).

2. **Calculate how much Stephen pays in the first 11 months:**
   - Stephen pays $25 each month for 11 months.
   - To find the total amount paid in 11 months, we do: \( 25 \times 11 = 275 \).

3. **Find out how much Stephen still owes after 11 months:**
   - Stephen owes a total of $306.
   - He has already paid $275.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a fun math problem in class!

1. **Find the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a box shape, so we need to multiply the length, width, and height.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:**
   The jelly beans don't fill the jar completely; they only fill about 80% of it.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Find out how many jelly beans fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

1. **Starting Point:**
   - The bus starts with 20 people.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 40 more people get on the bus.
   - So, the total number of people on the bus now is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

3. **Second Stop:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on the bus.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 40 is \( \frac{3 \times 40}{4} = 30 \).
   - So, 30 more people get on the bus.
   - The total number of people on the bus now is \(60 + 30 = 90\).

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how much Pauline spends on her visits to the museum before the price goes up. She visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, for one year, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

She does this for 5 years, so the total cost for the first 5 years is:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Next, the price of a visit increases by 150%. To find the new price, we first calculate 150% of $2:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times \$2 = \$3 \]

So, the new price of a visit is:

\[ \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

Now, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years at the new price. So, for one year, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$15/\text{year} \]

For 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$15/\text{year} = \$45 \]

Finally, to find the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years:

1. First, we need to know how many students are going to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th). So, we multiply 10 by 4:
   \[
   10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ students}

2. Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students we can make from these 40 students. We divide 40 by 8:
   \[
   40 \div 8 = 5 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, we multiply 5 by 45 to find out the total time:

"Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, and the longer piece is 4 times as long as the shorter piece. Let's figure out how long the longer piece is.

First, let's say the shorter piece is \( x \) feet long. That means the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet long. The total length of the board is the sum of these two pieces, so:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece, which is 4 times the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

First, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we can find out how many pounds he needs by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he will use. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

So, the first 16 minutes cost $4.00.

Next, after 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.20 per minute. The call lasts for 36 minutes in total, so we need to find out how many minutes are left after the first 16 minutes:
\[ 36 - 16 = 20 \]
So, there are 20 minutes left at the lower price. Now, we calculate the cost for these 20 minutes:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
So, the remaining 20 minutes cost $4.00.

Finally, we add the costs of both parts of the call together:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many treats Carly made in total. Since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats, we can calculate the total number of treats:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats per person} = 10 \text{ treats} \]

Next, we know that Carly made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's use \( c \) to represent the number of cupcakes. Then the number of brownies, \( b \), can be written as:

\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

We also know that the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10:

\[ c + b = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:

\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):

\[ 4c = 12 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):

\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

Next, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and the nail art costs $3 per nail. So, we calculate the total cost for the nail art:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, we need to multiply 3 by 12:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
So, she gets 36 issues from these 3 magazines.

Next, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, we just add 6:
\[ 36 + 6 = 42 \]
So, now she has 42 issues.

Finally, she has another magazine that sends 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine. So, we need to multiply 6 by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]
So, this magazine sends 24 issues.

Now, we add all the issues together:
\[ 42 + 24 = 66 \]

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]

So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, the problem tells us that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we can find out how many paintings Kim has.

1. **Starting Price in November**: The toy costs $40.
2. **Price Increase in December**: The price goes up by 80%. To find out how much it goes up, we multiply $40 by 80% (or 0.80):
   \[
   40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   So, the price increases by $32. Now, we add this to the original price:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72
   \]
   The new price in December is $72.
3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price then goes down by 50%. To find out how much it goes down, we multiply $72 by 50% (or 0.50):
   \[
   72 \times 0.50 = 36

Next, we need to find out how much he makes from the veteran lessons:
- He gives a 25% discount to veterans, so the price is 75% of $80.
- To find 75% of $80, we do \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per veteran lesson.
- He teaches 2 veteran lessons, so \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars from veteran lessons.

Now, we add the money from both types of lessons:
- Total money = Money from regular lessons + Money from veteran lessons
- Total money = \(320 + 120 = 440\) dollars.

So, Charlie will make 440 dollars for the day."

First, Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many he ate, we do:
\[ 60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24 \]
So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many apples are left after he ate 24:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]
So, he has 36 apples left.

Then, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find 25% of 36, we do:
\[ 36 \times \frac{25}{100} = 9 \]
So, he gave 9 apples to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister:
\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]
So, he has 27 apples left.

Finally, Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we do:
\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, Walter received $81.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of what she wrote this year. We need to find out how many novels she wrote this year.

If 9 novels are 3 quarters, then 1 quarter would be:

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

So, 1 quarter is 3 novels. Since there are 4 quarters in a whole, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, in 3 days, Michael travels for \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.

2. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels:**
   - Michael's speed is 50 km per hour.
   - So, in 72 hours, he travels \(50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km}\).

3. **Find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula: \(\left( \frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{total distance}} \right) \times 100\).
   - So, \(\left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%\).

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

1. **Madeline's Grapes:**
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Her Brother's Grapes:**
   Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make juice.
   So, he used:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Their Mother's Grapes:**
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie needs 12 grapes.
   So, she used:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Total Grapes:**
   To find out how many grapes there were at the beginning, we add up all the grapes used:
   \[
   6 + 30 + 48 = 84
   \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:
\[
\boxed{84}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know there are 82 teachers in total at Rydell Elementary School. Last Friday, 13 of them were sick, so they didn't come to school. 

To find out how many teachers were actually at school, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
82 - 13 = 69

Then, we add the 9 substitute teachers who came to help:
69 + 9 = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how much Bud spends each week on making macaroni and cheese.
   - The pasta costs $1.00.
   - The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
   - The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

2. Now, let's add up the costs for one week:
   - Pasta: $1.00
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: $6.00
   - Total for one week: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

3. Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total for one year: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

520.00"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how long it takes to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian works in a day. They work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, we multiply 8 by 60:
\[ 8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian spends cleaning each day. They have 5 days to clean all the classrooms, so we divide the total cleaning time by 5:
\[ 1200 \div 5 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning. We divide the time spent cleaning each day by the total working time each day, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{240}{480} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. So, the middle shelves together can hold:
   \[
   10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 \text{ shelves} = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. So, the bottom shelf can hold:
   \[
   2 \times 10 \text{ books} = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So, the top shelf can hold:
   \[
   20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. Now, let's add up all the books each bookcase can hold:
   \[
   20 \text{ books (middle shelves)} + 20 \text{ books (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ books (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
   \[
   \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books/bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
   \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 5 dozens would be:
5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Next, she paid $2.40 for each dozen. So, the total cost for 5 dozens is:
5 * $2.40 = $12.00

Now, Rose is selling the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
60 / 3 = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, her total earnings will be:
20 * $1 = $20.00

To find her profit, we subtract the total cost from her total earnings:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

3. After taking out the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats left}
   \]
4. Out of these 50 remaining hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is:
   \[
   50 - 30 = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Archie pays for the bag of beef jerky when it's on sale. The regular price is $18.00, but it's $3.00 off. So, we subtract $3.00 from $18.00:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

So, Archie pays $15.00 for the bag.

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. There are 30 sticks in the bag, and the bag costs $15.00. We divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick costs $0.50. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $0.50 is the same as 50 cents, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

So, the final answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many questions Audrey needs to get right in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of all the questions right. 

The total number of questions is 70 from the first test and 40 from the second test, which adds up to 110 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Next, we need to see how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions right:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]
So, she got 42 questions right on the first test.

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach 77 questions in total. We subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number she needs to get right:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them. She makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. And she makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

First, let's use a letter to represent the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call it \( S \).

The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write that as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes. We use the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The number of blueberry cubes is:
\[ 96 \]"

15 cars × 2 people per car = 30 people

Next, we need to figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 people to come in. We know that for every 25 phone calls, 1 person comes in. So, to get 30 people, Jason needs:

30 people × 25 phone calls per person = 750 phone calls

So, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, let's count the flashlights:
- Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people. So, that's 4 flashlights.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms. So, that's 2 flashlights per room times 8 rooms, which is 16 flashlights.
- Adding these together, we get 4 flashlights + 16 flashlights = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of 8 is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms with 4 small candles each gives us 4 rooms * 4 candles = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. Again, half of 8 is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each gives us 4 rooms * 5 candles = 20 medium candles.
- Adding these together, we get 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Finally, let's add the flashlights and candles together:
- Total flashlights and candles = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

So, Mitchell has 110 chips in total.

Now, Mitchell's family has five members, and they all want to share the chips equally. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips.

1. John takes 5 minutes to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side. So, each of these sides takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
4. Once John solves the fifth side, the sixth side is automatically solved, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up all the time:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

2. **Plants that need 1 cup of water:**
   - Crista has 8 plants that each need 1 cup of water.
   - So, for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups of water.

3. **Plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - She already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants.
   - So, the rest of the plants: \(20 - 12 = 8\) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - So, for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups of water.

Now, let's add up all the water needed:

1. **Distance on Land**: 
   - Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
   - Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to hop 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time on Land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Distance in Water**:
   - The other half of 200 yards is also 100 yards.
   - Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to swim 100 yards, we divide the distance by the speed:

First, we need to find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning each week. She has 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to clean.

- The cost for the blouses is 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- The cost for the pants is 2 pants * $8.00 per pair of pants = $16.00
- The cost for the skirt is 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

2. In the next 30 seconds, three times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. That means \(3 \times 20 = 60\) more pieces of popcorn.
3. In the third 30 seconds, four times as many kernels pop as in the first 30 seconds. That means \(4 \times 20 = 80\) more pieces of popcorn.
4. In the last 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the third 30 seconds. So, \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) more pieces of popcorn.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds also pop. That means \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) more pieces of popcorn.

Now, let's add all these up:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many lemons Tim needs for the lemonade for the pool party:
- The recipe says 1 cup of lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon of lemonade.
- Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
- So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice (1 cup per gallon times 4 gallons).

Next, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 4 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons make 1 cup of lemon juice.
- So, for 4 cups, he needs 4 cups times 6 lemons per cup, which is 24 lemons.

Now, let's think about Allen's request:
- Allen wants 1 gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
- This means Allen's gallon needs 2 cups of lemon juice (twice as much as the regular gallon).
- For 2 cups of lemon juice, he needs 2 cups times 6 lemons per cup, which is 12 lemons.

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the pool party and the lemons needed for Allen:
- 24 lemons for the pool party
- 12 lemons for Allen
- Total: 24 + 12 = 36 lemons

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much food each type of dog eats in a day:
- A German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of food each day.
- A Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food each day.

Next, we find out how much food all the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms each = 15 kilograms of food per day for the German Shepherds.

Now, we find out how much food all the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms each = 6 kilograms of food per day for the Bulldogs.

Then, we add the food for both types of dogs to get the total amount of food needed per day:
- 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms of food per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much food is needed for a whole week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, 21 kilograms per day * 7 days = 147 kilograms of food for the whole week.

So, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

147"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many legs all the 2-legged animals have together. Since each 2-legged animal has 2 legs, and there are 10 of them:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many legs all the 4-legged animals have together. Since each 4-legged animal has 4 legs, and there are 15 of them:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. 

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. So, we have:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ yellow blocks}
   \]
3. Now, we add the blue and yellow blocks together:
   \[
   4 \text{ blue blocks} + 8 \text{ yellow blocks} = 12 \text{ blocks}
   \]
4. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total:
   \[
   32 \text{ total blocks} - 12 \text{ blue and yellow blocks} = 20 \text{ red blocks}
   \]

So, the number of red blocks is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. To find out how far he goes, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles per hour} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

So, Elvis is 90 miles west of his house after the first part of his trip.

Next, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 miles per hour. Again, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles per hour} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to figure out how far he is from his house. Since he drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance he drove west from the distance he drove east:
\[ 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

54 miles"
"Okay, let's figure out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year:**
   - The boat starts at $9000.
   - It loses 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It loses another 30% of its value.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It loses 20% of its value.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we know there are 54 red candies.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies. So, we do:
   \[
   54 \times 2 = 108
   \]
   That means there are 108 orange candies.
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies. So, we do:
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
   That means there are 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up all the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find out how many pink candies there are, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

So, the number of pink candies is:
43"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Helen spent on her trip to Germany.

First, we need to find out how much she paid for the hotel. She stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, we multiply the number of nights by the cost per night:
\[ 3 \text{ nights} \times \$80/\text{night} = \$240 \]

Next, we need to figure out how much she paid for the bus rides. She took the bus 7 times, and each bus ride cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. First, we find 10% of $80:
\[ 10\% \times \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]
So, each bus ride costs $8. Now, we multiply the number of bus rides by the cost per ride:
\[ 7 \text{ rides} \times \$8/\text{ride} = \$56 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides to get the total amount Helen paid:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of \$296 for her hotel and bus travels during her trip.

296"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Mazie has 52 marbles in total. She gives all of them to Dallas and Darla. 

Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. So, before dropping any, Dallas had:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Now, if Dallas had 25 marbles, and Mazie had 52 marbles to start with, then the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how much the tickets cost. The mom and dad each need an adult ticket, and each adult ticket costs $12. So, for two adult tickets:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, the child needs a child ticket, which costs $8. So, for one child ticket:
\[ 8 \]

Then, they buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3. So, for two popcorns:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount they pay:
\[ 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \]

So, the family pays a total of $38.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much everything in the car weighs together. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds. The luggage weighs 250 pounds. John has two kids, and each kid weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of the kids is 75 pounds + 75 pounds, which is 150 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
- Car: 1200 pounds
- Luggage: 250 pounds
- Kids: 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The problem says that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (which is the same as 1%).

Force = 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, John needs 16 pounds of force to push the car.

"Okay, so James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers all around his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard is a rectangle, and the long sides are 20 feet each, while the short sides are 15 feet each. To find out how much crepe paper he needs, we need to figure out the total distance around the fence, which is called the perimeter.

To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides:
- There are two long sides, each 20 feet, so that's 20 + 20 = 40 feet.
- There are two short sides, each 15 feet, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 feet.

Now, we add the lengths of all the sides together:
40 feet + 30 feet = 70 feet

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

70 feet"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Mia is 40 years old, and she is 16 years younger than Emma. So, to find out how old Emma is, we add 16 years to Mia's age:
40 + 16 = 56
So, Emma is 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add Mia's age and Emma's age together and then divide by 2:
40 + 56 = 96
96 ÷ 2 = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48.

First, we need to add up all the seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found:
- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

So, we add these together:
214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells in total.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
- They found 67 cracked seashells.

So, we subtract the cracked seashells from the total:
732 - 67 = 665 good seashells.

Therefore, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Avery needs a 3-piece place setting for each of the 12 people coming to her holiday dinner. Each place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

1. **Dinner Plates:**
   - Each dinner plate costs $6.00.
   - For 12 people, she needs 12 dinner plates.
   - Total cost for dinner plates: \( 12 \times 6 = 72 \) dollars.

2. **Bowls:**
   - Each bowl costs $5.00.
   - For 12 people, she needs 12 bowls.
   - Total cost for bowls: \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Salad Plates:**
   - Each salad plate costs $4.00.
   - For 12 people, she needs 12 salad plates.
   - Total cost for salad plates: \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for dinner plates: $72
- Total cost for bowls: $60
- Total cost for salad plates: $48

So, the total amount Avery will spend on place settings is:
\[ 72 + 60 + 48 = 180 \]

Avery will spend $180 on place settings.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much feed one pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and they eat twice a day. So, for one pig:
4 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day

Now, Dexter has five pigs. So, we need to find out how much all five pigs eat in a day:
8 pounds/day/pig × 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day

Next, we need to find out how much feed all the pigs eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
40 pounds/day × 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the amount the pigs ate from the total amount of feed:
300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

So, after a week, Dexter has 20 pounds of feed left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs for the party. He invited 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, we multiply the number of people by the number of hot dogs each person will eat:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we know John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, we need to find out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs he already has} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs to buy by the number of hot dogs in each pack:
\[ 36 \text{ hot dogs} \div 6 \text{ hot dogs/pack} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much it will cost to buy these packs. Each pack costs $2. So, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, the money from cookies is:
  \[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, let's add the money from cupcakes and cookies to find the total money she makes:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Frances spends on the trays.

- She buys 5 trays at $4 each. So, the cost of the trays is:
  \[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she made to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

   - Total children now: \(5 + 5 = 10\).

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children brings 2 more children.
   - So, 10 children each bring 2 more children: \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

"Okay, so Mamou is helping people who lost their homes and food because of the floods. She has 1,360 meals to give out. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals. On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals. And on Sunday, she gave out 48 meals. To find out how many meals she has left, we need to add up the meals she already gave out and then subtract that number from the total number of meals she started with.

So, let's add the meals given out:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, let's subtract the meals given out from the total:

1. **Meditation:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - So, she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes each day.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for \(30 \times 7 = 210\) minutes.
   - In 4 weeks, she meditates for \(210 \times 4 = 840\) minutes.

2. **Yoga:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) 5 days a week.
   - So, in one week, she practices yoga for \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes.
   - In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time spent on both meditation and yoga, we add the time spent on each:

First, the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the small t-shirts will cover 3 * 11 = 33 square feet.

Next, the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the medium t-shirts will cover 4 * 8 = 32 square feet.

Then, the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the large t-shirts will cover 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

So, Ellen spent:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Lani bought:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes, each for $100, so:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

So, Lani spent:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, let's add what Ellen and Lani spent together:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, Ellen and Lani spent a total of:

"Okay, let's figure out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

So, the total cost to make one jar is:
$12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to make 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Now, let's figure out how much Tim makes from selling 10 jars:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Justin has in his jar. We need to add up the value of all the different coins.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Justin has 32 quarters.
   - 32 quarters × 25 cents = 800 cents
   - 800 cents = 8 dollars

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Justin has 95 dimes.
   - 95 dimes × 10 cents = 950 cents
   - 950 cents = 9.50 dollars

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Justin has 120 nickels.
   - 120 nickels × 5 cents = 600 cents
   - 600 cents = 6 dollars

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Justin has 750 pennies.
   - 750 pennies × 1 cent = 750 cents
   - 750 cents = 7.50 dollars

Now, let's add up all the dollars:
- 8 dollars (from quarters) + 9.50 dollars (from dimes) + 6 dollars (from nickels) + 7.50 dollars (from pennies) = 31 dollars

So, the total amount of money in the jar is:
31 dollars"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Janet spends $3.50 on ice cream.
2. She buys movie tickets for herself and her sister. Each ticket costs $7.50, so for two tickets, it's \(7.50 \times 2 = 15.00\).
3. She also buys a bracelet for $8.50.

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00\]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the $40:
\[40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00\]

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how many days Josh works in a week. He's open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works:
- Monday
- Tuesday
- Thursday
- Friday
- Saturday

That's 5 days a week.

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in a week. He services 3 cars each day, so in a week, he services:
3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week

Now, we need to calculate how much he earns in a week. He gets paid $4 for each car, so his weekly earnings are:
15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week

Finally, we need to find out how much he earns in 2 weeks. So, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
$60/week * 2 weeks = $120

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

1. **First, we start with the cookies Randy has:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Randy eats 3 cookies for an early snack, one of each type:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **For lunch, Randy eats 2 more oatmeal cookies:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

5. **For dinner, Randy bakes 4 more cookies of each type:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies Randy has left:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

So, the total number of cookies Randy has now is:
10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half:
- Half of 12 is 6. So, he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

Next, we calculate how much he will earn from each half:
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $5 each:
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30
  \]
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $7 each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42
  \]

Now, we add the amounts from both halves to find the total money he will earn:
\[
30 + 42 = 72
\]

So, Matthew would earn $72.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes each day, and Nate was gone for 14 days. So, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Now, when Nate gets back, he starts filling in the holes. He can fill 9 holes each day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the number of holes Nate actually fills each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill all 84 holes if he fills 3 holes each day. We divide the total number of holes by the number of holes he fills each day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know that Norman High School has 4000 students on average. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 

To find out how many students Butler High School has, we need to multiply 4000 by 3/4:
\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students on average.

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:
\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

First, we know the total number of cookies the Adams family has made is 7995.

Next, we know they have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.

To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they have, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

So, we do:
7995 (total cookies) - 2595 (rainbow cookies) - 3075 (oatmeal cookies)

Let's do the math:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

But Igor made some mistakes:
- He only got half as many test tubes as asked, so he got \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
- He got 2 more Petri dishes than asked, so he got \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
- He got the right number of beakers, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

In total, Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench. We need to find out how many beakers he lost.

Let's add up the items Igor actually placed on the bench:
- 8 test tubes
- 16 Petri dishes
- \(7 - x\) beakers (where \(x\) is the number of beakers he lost)

So, the equation is:
\[ 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[ 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

   4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws}
   \]

2. James is putting together 4 tables. So, the total number of screws needed for 4 tables is:
   \[
   4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws}
   \]

3. James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he needs from the number of screws he has:

So, Kim raised $750.

Next, Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so we add $400 to $300:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]
So, Maryam raised $700.

Now, we need to add up all the money raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a math problem in middle school.

1. **Vanessa's Distance**: We know Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. **Aaron's Distance**: Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half of Vanessa's distance. That means Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. **Aaron's Time**: Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
4. **Aaron's Speed**: To find out how fast Aaron runs, we divide the distance he ran by the time it took. So, Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, which means he runs 1 mile in 8 minutes.
5. **Vanessa's Speed**: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, if Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 16 minutes.
6. **Vanessa's Time**: Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she runs 1 mile in 16 minutes, for 4 miles, it would take her 4 times 16 minutes.

So, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step, like we're solving a math problem in class.

1. First, we need to find out how much the fruit vendor spent on all the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Next, we need to find out how much profit the vendor made. The profit is 25% of the total cost. So, we calculate 25% of $80:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]
   So, the profit is $20.

3. Now, we add the profit to the total cost to find out the total selling price:
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each watermelon was sold for. We divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total selling price}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2

1. **Dora's Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - So, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **James's Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

3. **John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is 18 years old, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

4. **Youngest Son's Age:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is 37 years old now, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**

1. **Ana's Peeling Time:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Jane's Peeling Time:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
   - So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   - To find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the radiator costs $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find out how much he saves, we calculate 80% of $400:

So, he saves $320. Now, we subtract that from the original price to find out how much he actually pays for the radiator:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step, like we're solving it in middle school.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. We need to figure out how many of these animals are chickens.

First, let's remember that:
- Chickens have 2 legs.
- Cows have 4 legs.

Let's use some simple math to solve this:

1. **Total number of animals:**
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens} + \text{Number of cows} = 20
   \]
   Let's call the number of chickens \( c \) and the number of cows \( k \). So:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. **Total number of legs:**
   \[
   2 \times \text{Number of chickens} + 4 \times \text{Number of cows} = 70
   \]
   Using \( c \) and \( k \), this becomes:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to find \( k \):
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
c + 2k - c - k = 15
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

So, there are 15 cows. Now, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.
