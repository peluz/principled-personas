"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we first need to calculate the number of eggs she has available for sale after her personal use. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 7 eggs for personal use.

The number of eggs remaining for sale is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Each egg is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value.
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into simpler steps. James runs 3 sprints per session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He performs these sprints 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Given that Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can consider the purchase in pairs:
- Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.
- The cost for one pair is \(5 + 3 = 8\) dollars.

Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Given the problem, we start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the information provided:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep in Seattle.
- According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so the number of sheep in Charleston, \( C \), is \( C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so the number of sheep in Toulouse, \( T \), is \( T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we sum the sheep in each city:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the subsequent full download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Download After Restart:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distances accordingly.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled away from home: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance traveled back home:
     \[
     \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Distance from home at the end of the 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Downloads in the second month = \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - Downloads in the third month = \(180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126\).

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Total downloads over the three months = Downloads in the first month + Downloads in the second month + Downloads in the third month.
   - Total downloads = \(60 + 180 + 126 = 366\).

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum these amounts.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

"To determine the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to achieve the desired average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent:**
   - Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
   - She then took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Total time spent so far: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Walked} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

"To determine the original price of the book before the discount, we can use the relationship between the discounted price and the original price. Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Let \( P \) represent the original price of the book. The equation can be set up as follows:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

- Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.
- He made his first stop after traveling 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, we calculate the position of the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means Henry's second stop was at the 45-mile mark. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve the problem, let's define the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. The first pair of high heels costs $33, and the second pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

We are given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by using the given ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages, which is 7:11, and their combined current age of 162.

First, let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the individual guesses and then find their mean.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Daily Care Time per Dog**: Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.
2. **Total Daily Care Time for All Dogs**: Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
3. **Weekly Care Time**: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Thus, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given the problem, we start by identifying the number of jewels each person has, based on the information provided.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Therefore, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   - Add the points from both periods:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine the total expenditure on yogurt over a 30-day period, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days:**
   - Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts consumed is:
     \[
     2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - The yogurts are sold at a rate of 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - The cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
     \[
     60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ 75.00 \]"
"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we start by calculating the total amount of money he made from selling his 13 lego sets. Each lego set was sold for $15, so the total revenue from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15/\text{set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he bought, each priced at $20:

\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20/\text{game} = \$160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the total amount of money he spent on the video games and the remaining $5 is:

\[ \$160 + \$5 = \$165 \]

Since the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, the calculation confirms that he used all the money from selling the lego sets. Therefore, he no longer has any of the lego sets he sold.

Thus, the number of lego sets John still has is:

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then divide the distance by the time.

John runs a total of 60 miles per week. He runs 3 days a week, with the following schedule:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To address the problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time distribution between running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she holds the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - The bag has 5 servings, and each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate the number of grams of chips that correspond to 200 calories:**
   - The total weight of the bag is 300 grams.
   - The total calories in the bag are 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram.
   - Grams of chips for 200 calories = 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Determine the amount of beeswax required:**
   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of materials:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - The total revenue from selling 20 candles is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing a package, she had a total of \(80 + x\) Post-it notes, where \(x\) is the number of Post-it notes in the package. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them can be expressed as:

\[ 80 + x = 220 + 23 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \(x\), we subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of blue ties John bought. Given that he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine the number of 6-inch pieces that can be obtained from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Given that 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is:
     \[
     15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - It is given that 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:

"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from his egg farm, we need to follow a series of calculations:

1. **Daily Egg Production**: Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
2. **Weekly Egg Production**: To find the total number of eggs produced in a week, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

3. **Eggs to Dozens Conversion**: Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we convert the total weekly production into dozens:
   \[
   \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
   \]

4. **Weekly Earnings**: Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find his total weekly earnings, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
   \[
   147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars per week from his egg farm."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels during his initial journey. Given that Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour and he sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, the duration of his initial journey is 3 hours. 

The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula, but solving for time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To address the issue of Uriah's heavy book bag, we need to calculate the weight reduction achieved by removing 30 comic books and then determine how many toys must be removed to meet the total weight reduction goal of 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the weight of the 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

After removing the comic books, Uriah has already reduced the weight of his book bag by 7.5 pounds. To reach the goal of 15 pounds, he needs to remove an additional:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve the remaining 7.5 pounds of weight reduction, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to meet his goal of reducing the weight of his book bag by 15 pounds.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the terms of her pension plan. According to the plan, Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years. However, starting after 20 years of service, she becomes eligible for an additional 5% of the full pension for each year beyond 20 years.

First, we calculate the number of years Marcy has worked beyond the 20-year mark:
\[ 30 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years} \]

Next, we determine the percentage of the full pension she is entitled to for these additional 10 years:
\[ 10 \text{ years} \times 5\% = 50\% \]

Now, we calculate 50% of the full pension amount:
\[ 50\% \times \$50,000 = 0.50 \times \$50,000 = \$25,000 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
\[ \$25,000 \]

"Given the problem, we start by defining the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David. 

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can express David's laundry as:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can express Raymond's laundry as:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, which means Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we sum the number of pets each person has:

\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is 28."

"To address the problem, we start by identifying the original running times of Lee and Gerald. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and was previously two seconds faster than Gerald, we can deduce Gerald's original time.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee's time: 38 seconds
   - Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald: \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time.
   - Improved time: \( 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \) seconds

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we start by defining the given relationships and values:

1. The number of dogs is given as 60.
2. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Then, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

Next, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[
60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's final batch of tomato sauce is 32 ounces.
   - Since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes is:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find the number of cans used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume per can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote this number as \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

"To determine the number of cookies Henry baked last year, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

"To determine Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate both the initial cost of the lumber and the revenue from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the initial cost of the lumber:
- Sasha has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total initial cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total initial cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total quantity used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, and the total amount of both combined is 120 units.

Let's denote the common factor by \( x \). Therefore, the amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons, and the amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups. The total amount can be expressed as:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the amount of sugar used by substituting \( x \) back into the expression for sugar:
\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express this relationship mathematically:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Therefore:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we calculate her new salary as follows:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

2. For the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. The distance covered in this period is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of the distances from both periods:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of letters Jennie stamped. Given that she has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps and she stamps one-third of them, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. After stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find out how many letters were already in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current total:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To calculate the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to determine both the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we start by defining the variables and setting up the relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

"To determine the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we can break down the observations as follows:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - 1/2 of the 30 bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Two times as many bees as initially left the hive leave again.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that had left and not yet returned come back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and had not returned = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and had not returned = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute.

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel their respective distances.

- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their travel times will tell us how long the winner will be waiting.

"To determine the total earnings from the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the cost for inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle, and then sum these costs.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires of their bicycles inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all the tires of their tricycles inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Since 100 cents equal 1 dollar, the total earnings in dollars are:
\[
500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we can set up an equation based on the sequence of events described. Let \( x \) represent the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
- Total weekly hours = \(9\) hours (MWF) + \(8\) hours (TTh) = \(17\) hours.

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
- Total semester hours = \(17\) hours/week \(\times 16\) weeks = \(272\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert the lengths of each type of baked good into feet and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To calculate the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we first determine the monthly banana consumption for all the apes combined:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

The total monthly consumption is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For a 2-month period, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

Thus, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - The initial depth on Monday is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - The depth on Wednesday is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:

\[
16 \text{ feet}

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we first need to calculate the number of each type of marine life caught by each individual and then sum these totals.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Next, we sum the totals for each type of marine life caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum the total number of all marine life caught:
- Total fish: \(15 + 9 + 8 = 32\)

Thus, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32."
"To solve the problem of determining the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Price and Increase Rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Price increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Number of Increases:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases over 36 months is:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
     \]

3. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is:
     \[
     1 + 0.20 = 1.20
     \]

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore, the final price is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $766.75.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the toys:
- Total cost of red cars = $20
- Total cost of action figures = $15
- Total cost of the doll = $15

Total value of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To evaluate the financial impact of Jackie's decision to either do her taxes herself or hire an accountant, we need to consider both the direct costs and the opportunity costs associated with each option.

1. **Opportunity Cost of Doing Taxes Herself:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of potential freelance work.
   - Her hourly rate for freelance work is $35.
   - Therefore, the opportunity cost of doing her taxes herself is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
     \]

2. **Cost of Hiring an Accountant:**
   - The accountant charges a flat fee of $90.

3. **Net Financial Impact:**
   - The net financial impact of hiring the accountant is the difference between the opportunity cost of doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.
   - This can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Net Financial Impact} = \text{Opportunity Cost} - \text{Cost of Accountant}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Net Financial Impact} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15
     \]

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Seth and Brooke. Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To determine the total time Billy will need to prep 60 potatoes, we need to consider the time required for both peeling and cutting each potato. 

First, let's calculate the time required for peeling:
- It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required for cutting:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

To convert the cutting time into minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we add the peeling and cutting times together to get the total prep time:

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into a set of equations and then solve for the unknowns.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information provided:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2

**Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each of the four members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 3 seconds less than the first runner, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 3 seconds less than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 3 seconds less than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The total time for Team 2 is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in their total times is:

"To address the question, we need to calculate the probabilities of two distinct events and then determine the relative likelihood of one event compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:
200%"

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we start by breaking down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - A pen of rabbits receives 20 pieces of straw.

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict is:

"To determine how much each of the three friends paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by three.

1. **Cost of tickets**: The total cost for 3 tickets is $20.25.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, the cost of food is:
   \[
   20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]
3. **Cost of rides**: Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides. Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   33 \times 2 = 66
   \]

Next, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Condition**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Total Increase Over 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Total Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Adding the total increase to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
6. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To address the problem, let's break it down methodically:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos, which is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) flamingos.
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and returned to the yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is now 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the yard.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we will calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month**: She collected three times the initial number of cards. Therefore, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. Therefore, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Third month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, we sum up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings, she has:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:

\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Sloane counted 100 customers.

2. **Second Day:**
   - She counted 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).

3. **Total Customers Over Three Days:**
   - The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

4. **Third Day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day.
   - The equation for the total number of customers over the three days is:
     \[
     100 + 150 + x = 500
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     250 + x = 500
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - 250
     \]
     \[
     x = 250
     \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( 250 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

Given the conditions:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

From the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

We substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the pair of shoes and the matching belt, we first calculate the total cost of these items. The pair of shoes costs $320.00, and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori must work to earn $352.00. Given that her hourly wage is $8.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:

\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance:

\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 220 \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower. Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we sum the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"Given the problem, we start by defining the current ages of the individuals involved. Let's denote Harriet's current age as \( H \), Adrian's current age as \( A \), and Zack's current age as \( Z \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Harriet's current age \( H = 21 \) years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age: \( A = 3H \).
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack: \( H = \frac{Z}{2} \).

First, we calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
A = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, we calculate Zack's current age:
\[
Z = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \( H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \) years
- Adrian's age in three years: \( A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 \) years
- Zack's age in three years: \( Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 \) years

To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we use the formula for the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{(H + 3) + (A + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[

"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we start by breaking down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points.
4. Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi.

First, we calculate Yuri's score:
- Half of Naomi's score: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate Brianna's score:
- Brianna's score: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we sum the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Total score of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

Finally, we find Jojo's score by subtracting the total score of the other three students from the overall total:
- Jojo's score: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to solve one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \( 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes solving puzzles over the weekend.

"To solve this problem, we start by noting the initial volume of water in the tank, which is 120 liters. Celine uses 90 liters of this water, so we subtract this amount from the initial volume to find the remaining water:

\[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding this collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives us the new total volume of water:

\[ 30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:
90 liters"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we start by calculating the number of petunias. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Given that he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias can be calculated as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Thus, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To determine the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we first note the expenditure for each year. In the first year, the company spent $15,000 on advertising. For the second year, the expenditure was a third of the first year's amount, which can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Adding the expenditures for both years gives us the total amount spent:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Thus, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we first need to calculate the new total number of cards and the new number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

The new total number of cards is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

"To determine the number of tomato vines Steve needs, we start by calculating the total weekly tomato consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Over a week (7 days), he consumes:
   \[
   6 \, \text{tomatoes/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
   \]

2. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Therefore, his girlfriend's weekly consumption is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \, \text{tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \, \text{tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. The total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is:

   Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   Colby takes 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \). According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

This difference is given to be twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

Let \( J_a \) represent the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) represent the number of bananas Jamal has. 

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Jamal's bananas and apples to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we sum up all the fruits to find the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is:

Given that 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can find out how many dozens of cookies 66 cookies represent:

\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \text{ dozens} \]

Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, the total amount of flour needed for 5.5 dozens is:

\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize, we will break down the problem into parts and calculate each step carefully.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines. All of these lines are Sean's to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Thus, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.

"To determine the number of cards with the letter D on them, we start by breaking down the distribution of the 80 cards based on the given fractions.

1. **Cards with the letter A:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Remaining cards after A cards:**
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards with the letter B:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Remaining cards after B cards:**
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Cards with the letter C:**
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Remaining cards after C cards (which have the letter D):**
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9 \text{ cards}
   \]

Thus, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9.

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of hole and then sum these times.

1. **Time for small holes:**
   - Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes: 30
   - Total time for small holes: \( 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time for large holes:**
   - Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes: 15
   - Total time for large holes: \( 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time for all holes: \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \)

4. **Convert total time to hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total time in hours: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours.

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. Each of them will age 10 years, so we add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to the current sum:

20 (current sum of their ages) + 10 (years for Mico) + 10 (years for Marco) = 40

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. 

40"
"To solve the problem, let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

   - Cost per popsicle: $0.25
   - Total cost for popsicles: \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5.00 \) dollars

2. Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
   - Number of ice cream bars: 4
   - Cost per ice cream bar: $0.50
   - Total cost for ice cream bars: \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 \) dollars

3. Sum the total costs:
   - Total cost for popsicles: $5.00
   - Total cost for ice cream bars: $2.00
   - Total amount paid: \( 5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00 \) dollars

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To determine half the number of spots that all the cobras and mambas have combined, we start by calculating the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks, we first need to determine the number of stories each wrote in the second week, given that they each doubled their output from the first week.

In the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, each doubled their first-week output:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we sum the stories written by each person over the two weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add the total number of stories written by all three:

"To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop for 55 cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

1 quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

1 dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these amounts together gives Kelly's total:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from her total amount:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine how many trucks are required to transport this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Thus, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the speeds of the two cars and the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

The car in the fast lane traveled a total distance of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of medals each person has. Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali. Therefore, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 39 \times 10 = 390 \text{ medals} \]

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will receive. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars, we find the number of chocolate bars left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will receive:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total working time and then apply her earning rate.

1. **Total Time Worked:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a span of 3 hours.
   - She takes a 30-minute break during this period.
   - Therefore, the actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Convert Working Time to Minutes:**
   - \(2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Calculate Earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes.
   - The number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes is \(150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals}\).
   - Therefore, her total earnings are \(15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the points each player has after the initial three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, which is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we consider the fourth round where each player receives an extra point if they have over 20 points:

- Mike has 21 points, so he receives an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not receive an extra point: \(18\) points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he receives an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points have been distributed is:

On the second day, the number of exercises he performed was:
- 120 pushups (100 + 20)
- 40 squats (50 - 10)
- 40 dumbbell presses (20 * 2)

Summing these up:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, the total count of activities over the two days is:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Daily Rice Consumption per Person:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice twice a day:
   \[
   0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Rice Consumption for the Household:**
   There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   0.4 \text{ kg/day/person} \times 5 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Rice Consumption:**
   To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. **Duration the 42 kg Bag Will Last:**
   Finally, to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives if the company performs well. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Total working days in April: \( 4.29 \times 5 \approx 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can only work whole days, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).

"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning. Given that the bakery produces 60 loaves each day and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This leaves us with the remaining loaves:

\[ \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, we are told that half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \]

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after consuming Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days, we need to break down the growth rates for both arms and legs.

1. **Growth of Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over a period of 15 days, the number of new arms can be calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **Growth of Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over a period of 15 days, the number of new legs can be calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total Number of New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Therefore, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Three family members consume 3 eggs each per day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
   - The remaining two family members consume 2 eggs each per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

2. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week): \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish a few key points from the information provided:

1. **Cera's Current Age**: Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago**: Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera was 40 years old six years ago, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
3. **Noah's Current Age**: Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.
4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago**: The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
5. **Population of Chile Now**: Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now. Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile. Then, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\). Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of players:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is given by:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required by setting up a proportion based on the given ratio.

The ratio 1:3 means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if we let \( x \) represent the number of electric poles, we can write the proportion as:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
3x = 45
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is:

"To determine the number of women left at the party, we start by calculating the total number of people initially present. There were 25 men and 15 women, which sums to:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ people} \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means the number of people remaining at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women remaining, we subtract the number of men remaining from the total number of people remaining:

"To determine the total number of boxes required to store all the pencils that Jam and her sister, Meg, have, we first need to calculate the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes. Given that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, given that each box holds 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the addition of cream. 

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

Let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

1. At the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Thus, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 students fewer than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[
C + 2C = 60
\]

\[
3C = 60
\]

\[
C = 20
\]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[
H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[
\text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H)
\]

Substituting the values of \( C \) and \( H \):

\[
\text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40)
\]

\[
\text{Total legs} = 80 + 80
\]

\[
\text{Total legs} = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given the problem, we start by noting the weight of the pink frog, which is 50 pounds. From this, we can deduce the weights of the other animals based on the relationships provided:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Summing these weights:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, we start by calculating the savings from the market price. The market price of the wallpaper is $400, and Ethan saves 20% by making it himself.

First, we calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80. To find the total cost of making the wallpaper, we subtract the savings from the market price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the sales for each day and account for any returns.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold half the number of pairs sold on Saturday, which is \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Next, we sum the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts based on the different milk yields from the two groups of sheep.

1. **First Group of Sheep:**
   - Number of sheep: 30 / 2 = 15
   - Milk yield per sheep: 1 kg
   - Total milk from this group: 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

2. **Second Group of Sheep:**
   - Number of sheep: 30 / 2 = 15
   - Milk yield per sheep: 2 kg
   - Total milk from this group: 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding the milk from both groups gives us the total daily milk collection:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Total number of pupils**: 40
2. **Pupils who like blue**: Half of the class likes blue, so:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ pupils}
   \]
3. **Remaining pupils after those who like blue**: 
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ pupils}
   \]
4. **Pupils who like green**: One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pupils}
   \]
5. **Pupils who like yellow**: The rest of the pupils like yellow, so:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ pupils}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can use the information that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means that the remaining land, 12.8 hectares, represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine the energy savings, we start by calculating the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner before and after the reduction in usage time.

1. **Initial Daily Energy Consumption:**
   - The air conditioner has a power rating of 900 watts.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption is calculated as:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. **Reduced Daily Energy Consumption:**
   - The usage time is reduced by 5 hours, so the new usage time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. **Daily Energy Savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the initial and reduced daily energy consumption:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. **Convert Daily Energy Savings to Kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. **Total Energy Savings Over 30 Days:**
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the total energy savings over 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To determine the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

2. Sum the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

3. Count the total number of zebras:
   \[
   2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]

4. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

Thus, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine the total cost Tyson will incur for the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches required:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the initial quantities of corn and cannolis at Allan's house. According to the problem, Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he initially has 40 cannolis.

1. Calculate the initial number of corns:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

2. Allan then buys 60 more cannolis:
   \[
   \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

3. Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Combined total} = 60 + 100 = 160
   \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
160

"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information provided:

1. Elliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps.
2. He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
3. He did an additional 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, we calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ (goal)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left)} = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

To find the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the total steps he had taken by the end of his jog:
\[ 8,000 \text{ (total steps by end of jog)} - 6,000 \text{ (steps before jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract this from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"To determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we can follow a step-by-step approach using the given probabilities and the total number of candles.

1. **Calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means there is a 1% chance that a candle will explode.
   - The total number of candles is 50,000.
   - Therefore, the number of candles expected to explode is:
     \[
     0.01 \times 50,000 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:**
   - We are given that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 500 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

"To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip through Europe, we can break down the trip into distinct segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Total distance for this day: \( 0 \, \text{km} \).

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

Now, we sum the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we first establish the elevation at which the comb landed. Given that Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, the comb's final elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we consider Oliver's current elevation, which is 3,000 feet. To find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial number of cats, which is 50. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats removed by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats. 

Subtracting the 20 cats that were carried away by the boats from the initial 50 cats, we have:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats remaining on the rock} \]

Next, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find this number, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtracting the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left, we get:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To address the problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( C \) represent the total number of cards Kenny initially had.

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5. The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Setting up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To address the problem, let's start by calculating the total number of hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, with the assumption that half of these guests would want two hotdogs, and the other half would want one hotdog.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for them.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we start by noting that Indras has 6 letters in her name. 

Next, we calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the number of letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 to this result gives us the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Finally, we add the number of letters in both names to find the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order, we first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the discount. The set of pots and pans is priced at $120.00, the set of mixing bowls at $20.00, and each of the 5 utensils at $5.00. The total cost for the utensils is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \times 5.00 = 25.00 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of $165.00:

\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:

\[ 132.00 \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we first calculate the total cost of these items. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we start by calculating the weight of each piece. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have consumed is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting the weight of the consumed pieces from the total weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total weight of onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine doubles this amount: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

2. **Calculate the cost of the onions:**
   - Onions are priced at $2.00 per pound.
   - Total cost for onions: \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box is priced at $2.00.
   - Total cost for beef stock: \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Calculate the total cost of all ingredients:**
   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock
   - Total cost = \(8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}\).

5. **Calculate the cost per serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings
   - Cost per serving = \(12 \text{ dollars} / 6 \text{ servings} = 2 \text{ dollars/serving}\).

The cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is \(2\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time difference in the departure times of Wayne and Bernadette to ensure Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - If Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \), Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine Bernadette's departure time:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Determine Wayne's departure time:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his travel time is 4 minutes).

6. **Calculate the difference in their departure times:**
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We are given that the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to follow the sequence of events and their effects on the temperature.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**: Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. Therefore, the total temperature increase due to baking is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]
3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - With the super ticket, you get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The regular movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let the regular price of the popcorn be \( P \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]
     \[

"To determine the cost Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we start by calculating the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, the original cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the car's average speed over the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- The total distance traveled is:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Now, we can find the average speed:
- The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
  \[
  \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
  \]

Thus, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"To determine the total number of cards in the set, we need to calculate the number of each color of card and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

Now, we sum up all the cards:
- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24
- Yellow cards: 39

Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, with 3 of them having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, with 4 of them having spots.

First, we find the total number of puppies:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of spotted puppies:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of spotted puppies, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** \(2 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ pound/box} = 2 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Carrots:** \(4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Hay:** \(42 \text{ bales} \times 75 \text{ pounds/bale} = 3150 \text{ pounds}\)
   - **Oats:** \(20 \text{ sacks} \times 65 \text{ pounds/sack} = 1300 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to a consistent unit. The shark's length is given in feet, and the remoras' lengths are given in inches. 

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each remora is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras:
   - There are 2 remoras, so the combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
   - The shark's length is 10 feet.
   - The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
   - The percentage is calculated as \( \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \).

- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Summing these temperatures:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Next, we divide the sum by the number of regions (3):
-30 / 3 = -10°F

Thus, the average highest temperature of these three regions is -10°F.

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount needed for the toy car, we first calculate the total amount the child still needs to save. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. Therefore, the remaining amount to be saved is:

\[ \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

The child plans to save $2 each day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the total amount needed by the daily savings:

\[ \frac{\$8}{\$2 \text{ per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Thus, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather effectively gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, and Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to sum the heights of the cheerleaders, considering their arrangement. The pyramid is structured as follows: 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the third level, and 1 at the top. The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Adding these heights together gives the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the number of walking breaks per day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours each day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. Therefore, she takes 8 walking breaks each day.

2. **Calculate the total walking time per day:**
   Each walking break is 5 minutes long. Thus, the total walking time per day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ breaks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/break} = 40 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total walking time over 5 days:**
   Charisma works for 5 days, so the total walking time over this period is:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided for each venue.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
   \[ L + D + B = 43 \]
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
   \[ L = D + 7 \]
3. David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.
   \[ D = \frac{1}{2}B \]

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Given the problem, we start by identifying the dimensions provided and the relationships between the objects:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, the length of the couch is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood he can purchase within his budget.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, we should consider the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood is cheaper, so we will focus on buying as many of these as possible within the budget.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Determine the total number of legs**: Each sled dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 sled dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed**: Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs. Thus, the number of pairs required is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Compute the total cost**: Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost for 12 pairs is:
   \[
   12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"To determine the savings Janet would achieve by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bus trips:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She does this 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 10 trips:
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The total cost for 10 trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

The savings by buying the weekly bus pass is:
- Savings = Total cost of bus trips without the pass - Cost of the weekly bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To determine the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo, we need to carefully analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Next, we calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Finally, we add the totals from the farm and the zoo to find the combined total number of animals:

"To achieve his New Year's resolution of losing 30 pounds by his birthday on July 19th, Andy needs to establish a consistent daily calorie deficit. Given that today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days until July 19th and the required daily calorie deficit.

First, let's determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:

- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it is not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Summing these days:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since 1 pound of body weight is approximately equivalent to 3500 calories, the total calorie deficit needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve the problem, let's define the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, which can be expressed as:

\[ H = 3L \]

We are also given that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour, we need to calculate the picking rate for each individual and then sum these rates.

1. **Tony's Picking Rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total Picking Rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we start by dividing the total quantity of raisins equally among the three intended uses: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Given that the jumbo bag contains 27 cups of raisins, each use will receive:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins, knowing that each batch requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins. The number of batches is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
\]

Thus, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the current daily cost of electricity:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.
   - Therefore, the current daily cost is:
     \[
     12 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 18 \, \text{\$}
     \]

2. **Calculate the additional daily cost of the new device:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.
   - Therefore, the additional daily cost is:
     \[
     2 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3 \, \text{\$}
     \]

3. **Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device:**
   - The total daily cost after adding the new device is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{\$} + 3 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The current weekly cost is:
     \[
     18 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 126 \, \text{\$}
     \]
   - The weekly cost after adding the new device is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{\$} \times 7 = 147 \, \text{\$}
     \]

5. **Find the difference between the two weekly costs:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     147 \, \text{\$} - 126 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$}
     \]

Thus, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by understanding the rate at which one person can paint.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it follows that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. Converting days to hours, since there are 24 hours in a day, one person would take \(10 \times 24 = 240\) hours to paint a whole house.
3. If 5 people are working together, the total time required to paint the house is divided by 5. Therefore, the time it would take 5 people to paint a whole house is \(240 \div 5 = 48\) hours.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem statement.

Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we determine the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount Tom spent: $48.
2. Identify the cost of the CD: $4.
3. Calculate the cost of the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44
   \]
4. Determine how many additional CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8-week period, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Regular Routine**: Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. **Variations**:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each week.
   - For one week, he spent 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks with 5 hours each: 2
- Week with 6 hours: 1
- Weeks with 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Now, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to track the number of passengers on the bus at each stop.

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The bus starts with 48 passengers.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - New total number of passengers: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second Stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - Remaining passengers: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - New total number of passengers: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining Jame's current age. Given that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we can calculate his current age as follows:

\[ \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:

\[ \text{Jame's age in 8 years} = 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[ \text{Twice Jame's age in 8 years} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

Now, we need to determine the cousin's current age. Since the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55:

\[ \text{Cousin's current age} = 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Finally, we find the age difference between Jame and his cousin by subtracting Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

\[ \text{Age difference} = 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To determine the cost of one monitor, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the necessary equations.

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we find the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ \text{Total cost of the computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800 \]

We then subtract this total from the overall expenditure to find the total cost of the 2 monitors:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600 \]

Finally, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To determine the number of seashells each girl brought back, we start by noting that each boy brought back 60 seashells. According to the problem, each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times that amount.

Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \). Therefore, \( B = 60 \).

The number of seashells each girl brought, \( G \), can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books arranged on a shelf, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum these values.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, which means its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to complete her monthly goal, we first sum the vlogs she has already produced over the first three weeks. The vlogs made are as follows: 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's monthly goal is to produce 72 vlogs. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already produced from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

"To determine the total amount you need to pay, we first calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the check is split evenly, each person would normally pay half of the original bill:

\[ \text{Each Person's Share} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

However, you are responsible for the entire tip. Therefore, your total payment is:

\[ \text{Your Total Payment} = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Thus, you end up paying $35.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To determine the total cost Daniel will incur for his purchases, we first calculate the cost of each item before applying the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\) dollars.
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times 12.00 = 12.00\) dollars.
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times 10.00 = 10.00\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\] dollars.

The shop offers a 10% discount on all purchased items. Therefore, the discount amount is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings. John works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, which totals:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $2 per hour, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Identify the number of buttons with two holes:**
   - There are 7 buttons with two holes each.

2. **Calculate the total number of holes for these buttons:**
   - Each of these 7 buttons has 2 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes for these buttons is \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) holes.

3. **Determine the number of buttons with four holes:**
   - The total number of buttons in the bag is 21.
   - Since 7 buttons have two holes, the remaining buttons have four holes.
   - The number of buttons with four holes is \( 21 - 7 = 14 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of holes for these buttons:**
   - Each of these 14 buttons has 4 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes for these buttons is \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) holes.

5. **Sum the total number of holes:**
   - The total number of holes in the bag is the sum of the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes.
   - This is \( 14 + 56 = 70 \) holes.

Thus, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"To determine the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to calculate the individual weights of each person.

1. **Mark's Weight:**
   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.

2. **Susan's Weight:**
   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   - Therefore, Susan's weight is \( 150 - 20 = 130 \) pounds.

3. **Bob's Weight:**
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   - Therefore, Bob's weight is \( 2 \times 130 = 260 \) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle and the rate at which the sun moves.

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.

3. **Total Movement Over 10 Hours**: 
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The reading rate is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \).
- Therefore, the number of pages read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent Shiloh's current age.
- Let \( N \) represent his nephew's current age.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Given the information, we can set up the following equations based on the goals scored by each teenager:

- Let \( R \) represent the number of goals scored by Richie.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of goals scored by Mark.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of goals scored by Anna.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 80 \)
2. \( R = M + 20 \)
3. \( R = A + 45 \)

First, we solve for \( M \) using the second equation:
\[ M = R - 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) using the third equation:
\[ A = R - 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 \]
\[ R + M + A = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage error is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be:

\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied. The original price for one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price for one box is:

\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Thus, the cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:

\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

The cost per pair of contacts is then:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories burned from her activities. 

For the aerobics session:
- Duration: 2 hours
- Calories burned per hour: 500 calories
- Total calories burned from aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)

For the running session:
- Duration: 1 hour
- Calories burned per hour: 600 calories
- Total calories burned from running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we sum the total calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned: \(1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\)

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, the amount of water she needs to drink is:
- Water needed: \(\frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}\)

Thus, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can determine the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

"To determine the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to identify the values of these measurements. Initially, Jared types at 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to improve and increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his third measurement will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

First, we sum the measurements:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Then, we divide the sum by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days it will take for a beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The initial height is 4 feet, and the height doubles each day. Therefore, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( H(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day:

- Day 0: \( H(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 1: \( H(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 2: \( H(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \text{ feet} \)
- Day 3: \( H(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \text{ feet} \)

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine the total grams of protein John consumes per week from mushrooms, we can follow a straightforward calculation process:

1. **Determine the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(2 \times 3 = 6\) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms each day, so he consumes 6 grams of protein per day.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the total protein intake per week is \(6 \times 7 = 42\) grams.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \). According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental procedures and then determine the additional amount he needs to earn, given his deposit and hourly wage.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an additional cost of $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to determine the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
90 degrees"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. Each type of coin can be converted to its equivalent in cents:

- Quarters: \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents
- Dimes: \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents
- Nickels: \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents
- Pennies: \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents

Summing these amounts gives the total amount of money Colby has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs Colby can buy is:
\[ \frac{345 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 69 \text{ gumballs} \]

Thus, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine the final weight Jamaal uses, we start with the initial weight of 8 pounds. He increases this weight by 50%, which can be calculated as:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 0.50 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this increase to the original weight:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

However, since 12 pounds is too heavy, Jamaal decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To determine the additional hours required for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we use this speed to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles. The time required is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa.

Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa's production rate is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Ruiz produces in two hours. Since Ruiz produces 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can produce in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals to find the combined production:
\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

   - Number of cups sold per hour: 15
   - Price per cup: $0.50
   - Earnings per hour: \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \)
   - Total earnings for 4 hours: \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Second Segment (Next 2 hours):**
   - Number of cups sold per hour: 10
   - Price per cup: $0.60
   - Earnings per hour: \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \)
   - Total earnings for 2 hours: \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Total Earnings:**

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire undergoes based on the distance driven and compare it to the maximum number of rotations the tire can handle.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - The tire can undergo a maximum of 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the maximum number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the outfit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25, and the shorts cost $35. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. We calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Thus, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need for his croissant production, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Butter Requirement per Dozen Croissants:**
   - It is given that 1/4 pound of butter is required to make 1 dozen croissants.

2. **Butter Requirement for 4 Dozen Croissants:**
   - Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we multiply the butter requirement for 1 dozen by 4:
     \[
     \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound} = 1 \text{ pound}
     \]

3. **Butter Requirement for a Week:**
   - Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily butter requirement by 7:
     \[
     \text{Butter for 7 days} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the repaving cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29,100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95,060 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in cost:
\[
\text{Difference} = 95,060 \text{ dollars} - 29,100 \text{ dollars} = 65,960 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

2. **Extended Research Period:**
   - The total research period is 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months.
   - The additional months beyond the initial 5 months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - Monthly funding for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding.
   - Increased monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional 45 months cost
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat. 

1. The first player consumed a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player had 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, which totals 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, this amounts to 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Summing these amounts:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

2. **Determine the total amount of water used per year:**
   - Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
   - Therefore, the total amount of water used per year is:
     \[
     104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water used:**
   - The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon.
   - Therefore, the total cost of water for laundry per year is:
     \[
     2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

Thus, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total daily meat sales and then divide the total weight of the bull by this daily amount.

First, we calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day:
\[ \text{Meat sold per hour} = 15 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Hours worked per day} = 10 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Total meat sold per day} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we determine how many days it will take to sell the entire bull:
\[ \text{Weight of the bull} = 750 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Number of days to sell the bull} = \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we start by calculating the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we account for the seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats gives us the remaining seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

Of these remaining seats, one-third are occupied by the parents:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats gives us the number of seats occupied by the students:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]"

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the truck over the week, we can break down the week into two segments: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the truck towed 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Thus, the number of cars towed each day for these four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the totals from both segments gives us the total number of cars towed over the week:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to reach the minimum height requirement of 4 feet to ride the roller coaster. 

First, let's convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more inches Adam needs to grow to meet this requirement. Adam's current height is 40 inches, so the additional height needed is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows at a rate of 2 inches per year. To determine how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the additional height needed by his annual growth rate:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine James's earnings from his job selling used cars, we need to calculate the total sales, the cost to the company for acquiring the cars, the profit from these sales, and finally, James's commission based on the profit.

1. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   - James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

2. **Acquisition Cost Calculation:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost.
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

4. **Commission Calculation:**
   - James's commission is 10% of the profit.
   - James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500 from his job selling used cars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob, given their respective speeds and the initial distance between them.

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.
   - The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to close the distance:**
   - The initial distance between Tom and Bob is 75 miles.
   - Using the relative speed, we can find the time it takes for Tom to close this distance:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}

"Given the information, we can set up the relationships between the number of fish caught by each individual as follows:

- Let \( N \) represent the number of fish Naomi caught.
- Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so Darren caught \( N - 6 \) fish.
- Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \( (N - 6) + 3 \) fish.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so \( N = 17 \).

Substituting \( N = 17 \) into the equation for Tommy's fish:
\[
\text{Tommy's fish} = (17 - 6) + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to analyze the cost per class as a function of the number of classes attended.

Given:
- Total cost for the classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

The cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum value of \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production of customers processed by Julie and Jewel, we start by calculating the daily and weekly customer throughput for each of them.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we are informed that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the combined total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. The volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) can be calculated as:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we start by calculating the amount of flour in one bag. Each bag is divided into 8 portions, with each portion weighing 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of flour in one bag is:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Since we have three bags, the total amount of flour in all three bags is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kg/bag} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each individual covered and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we sum the distances to find the total distance biked:
- Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
- Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To calculate the total time Bill will need to dig the well, we must consider the different rates at which he can dig through soil and clay, and the respective depths he needs to dig through.

1. **Determine the digging rate for soil:**
   - Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.

2. **Calculate the time to dig through 24 feet of soil:**
   - Time = Distance / Rate
   - Time through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours

3. **Determine the digging rate for clay:**
   - Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.

4. **Calculate the time to dig through 8 feet of clay:**
   - Time through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours

5. **Calculate the total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours.

"To address the problem, we start by identifying the sales from the green hats in the first month. Given that the sales from red hats were $400 and this amount is half of the sales from green hats, we can set up the following equation to find the sales from green hats:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month by summing the sales from both red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, we calculate the total sales for the second month as follows:

\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the total sales over the two months, we sum the sales from both months:

\[ \text{Total sales for both months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required:**
   Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the number of whole eggs required.
   \[
   \text{Number of whole eggs} = \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write for her 15-page research paper, we first calculate the number of pages she has already completed. Since she has finished 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Pages completed} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

Subtracting the pages completed from the total number of pages required gives us the number of pages left to write:

\[ \text{Pages left} = 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Mike to read a 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day, and then compare this to the 30-day deadline.

First, we calculate the total number of days required for Mike to complete the book:
\[ \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish reading:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total days available} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to acquire and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase cost and the ongoing monthly expenses for hanger rental and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Expenses**: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost**: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

To find the annual maintenance cost, we multiply the total monthly maintenance cost by 12:
- **Annual Maintenance Cost**: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total Cost for the First Year**: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, we start by defining the cooking times for each item based on the given information:

1. The cooking time for rice is given as 30 minutes.
2. The cooking time for pork is 20 minutes more than the cooking time for rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Next, we sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we first calculate the cost of each mixture individually.

For the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

The difference in cost between the two mixtures is:
- \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese. We can write the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the Coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of $5 is calculated as \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.
   - Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, using 1 pound per day, which totals 7 pounds.
   - The total cost for the coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the Donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

3. **Total Cost:**

2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The remaining days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of these days over the past 30 days is as follows:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

The next three days are specified as:

"To determine Karen's earnings over two days, we start by calculating her hourly wage. Given that Lorie earns $10 per hour and Karen earns twice that amount, Karen's hourly wage is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her earnings per day are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find her total earnings over two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by finding the ratio of hash browns to potatoes based on the given information. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of hash browns to potatoes is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Using this ratio, we can calculate the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is 576."
"To determine the extent to which the group exceeds the elevator's maximum load, we first calculate the total weight of the group. Given that the average weight of an adult is 80 kg and there are 9 adults (including Jack) in the elevator, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The elevator's maximum load capacity is 700 kg. Therefore, the amount by which the group exceeds the maximum load is:

\[ \text{Excess weight} = 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the number of cookies each individual has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, denoted as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
298

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extended length of the dress:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to the extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know this total length is 140 cm:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]
Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Add the time for ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode.
   - \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( T \) represent the age of one of the twins, and \( R \) represent the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes of homework.

John has 3 hours before he needs to eat dinner. Converting this time into minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Subtracting the time spent on homework from the total available time before dinner:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the cost of the lollipops and candies that Manolo initially bought. Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost for five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

The total cost for the five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Therefore, the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Thus, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we start by calculating their monthly savings and then extend this to the total period.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Over ten years, which is 120 months, Rong's total savings can be calculated as:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years, Neil's total savings can be calculated as:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

To find the combined total savings of Rong and Neil over ten years, we add their individual totals:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
5760"
"To solve this problem, we first calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( T \) represent the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can express the heartworm check as:
\[ 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

Thus, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To determine the total price of a crate of fresh fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The prices are as follows:

- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. **Bananas:**
   - 5 bananas \(\times\) $1.00 per banana = $5.00

2. **Apples:**
   - 12 apples \(\times\) $0.50 per apple = $6.00

3. **Oranges:**
   - 7 oranges \(\times\) $3.00 per orange = $21.00

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:

\[
5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00
\]

Thus, the total price for the crate of fruit is $32.00.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each type of colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Next, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire for the function, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required and then compare it to the number of chairs currently available at the restaurant.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs required:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
   - Each adult will need a regular chair, and each baby will need a high chair.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs required is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 15 \text{ (high chairs)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs currently available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs currently available is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs required is 57.
   - The total number of chairs currently available is 48.
   - The number of additional chairs needed is:

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationship between the speeds of the cat and the turtle. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is given as 15 feet per second. 

First, we calculate the turtle's speed:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to determine how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their fundraising goal, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the hourly fundraising rate:**
   - The firefighters raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
   - Therefore, the hourly rate of fundraising is:
     \[
     \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed:**
   - The total fundraising goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - The remaining amount needed is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total water usage by the city:**
   The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the industrial water usage:**
   80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the industrial water usage is:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
   This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the non-industrial water usage:**
   The non-industrial water usage is the remaining portion of the city's total water usage. Thus, it is:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice creams and then scale these rates to the 48-hour period.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
   - For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream:**
   - Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

"To determine Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount, we first calculate the total cost of each item he ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = \$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00 \]

Marcus has a loyalty card that provides a 10% discount on his purchase. We calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 10\% \times \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:

\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00 \]

Thus, Marcus' total bill is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we start by calculating the total amount of candy each person consumes over the 14-day period.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces Ginger eats:
\[
4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces Amy eats:
\[
3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we determine how much candy each person has left after 14 days. Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

For Ginger:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
\]

For Amy:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger:
\[
58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"To determine the savings James made by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost for picking: $20
   - Variable cost per pound: $1.5
   - Total pounds picked: 30

   The total cost of picking can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = \text{Fixed cost} + (\text{Variable cost per pound} \times \text{Total pounds picked})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Total pounds: 30

   The total cost of buying can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of buying} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Total pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of buying} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

"To determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, we first need to calculate the time each takes individually.

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog's time is:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Next, we calculate the average time by summing the times and dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches and add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

3. **Percentage of blue spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Converting to a percentage:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of the individuals involved. Let's denote Dora's age as \( D \), her father's age as \( F \), and her mother's age as \( M \).

Given:
- Dora's age, \( D = 15 \) years.
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidates A and B based on the given percentages and relationships.

1. Candidate A received 20% of the total votes. Given that there were 100 voters:
   \[
   \text{Votes for A} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Votes for B} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
   \]

3. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for the votes for candidates A and B:
   \[
   \text{Votes for C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for A} + \text{Votes for B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of apples each person has. Boris initially has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. Therefore, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, Boris gives 10 apples to Beck. After this transaction, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

Thus, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

\]

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books, which is twice the number of books Steven has, we can determine that Steven has \(20 / 2 = 10\) books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has \(10 + 6 = 16\) books. To find how many more books Clara has compared to Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \(20 - 16 = 4\).

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To address the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the distribution of their hobbies. The class consists of 50 students. Out of these, 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the remaining students are divided between playing video games and playing music.

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as follows:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine how many students are left for the hobby of playing video games. We subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of students who like to play video games is:

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the number of birds that were initially scared away. Jeremy saw 12 birds and threw a stone, scaring away 1/3 of them. 

\[ \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This leaves:

\[ \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[ \text{Total birds} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Thus, the number of birds now in the backyard is:

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we start by noting that the total number of students in both classes is 80, and each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, the number of students in each class is:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in each class as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is:

"To compare the costs of the two amusement parks for Jake's family, we need to calculate the total expenses for each park based on the given fees and the number of family members.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

The total cost for the first amusement park is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first park} = (2 \times 26) + (2 \times 12) = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14.
- The cost for each child is $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

The total cost for the second amusement park is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost for the second park} = (2 \times 14) + (2 \times 10) = 28 + 20 = 48 \]

To find the savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ \text{Savings} = 76 - 48 = 28 \]

Therefore, Jake's family will save \(\$28\) by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out over two 4-week months, we need to break down the calculation into weekdays and weekends, and then sum the totals.

First, let's calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- Each 4-week month has 4 weeks, and each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- Therefore, in one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- Over two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
- Total chairs rented on weekdays: \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).

Then, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:
- Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
- Total chairs rented on weekends: \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

Finally, we sum the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- Total chairs rented: \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\).

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the transactions and conversions of stickers to buttons. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Number of large stickers left: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \)

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

8. **Final Total of Small Buttons:**

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the equation \( F + A = 33 \):

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can start by analyzing the given information:

1. Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as \( P \). According to the problem, one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3}P = 6

"To determine the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of cases needed for the first house. According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distances covered both by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the rides on the usual days and the rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This occurs for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This occurs for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought from the pet store. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let:
- \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total number of trees planted in Ashley's school reforestation campaign, we need to consider the contributions from both students and teachers. 

First, we calculate the number of students:
- The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 40 \times 25 = 1000 \).

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Thus, the total number of trees planted by students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Then, we calculate the number of teachers:
- The school has 40 classes, with 3 teachers per class.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \).

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- Thus, the total number of trees planted by teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Finally, we sum the trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = \( 1000 + 240 = 1240 \).

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
1240"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Thus, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

For the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so the total hours played in this period is:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

For the next week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours played in this period is:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Thus, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **First Car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second Car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Thus, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To determine the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, and then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade's pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40, so the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80. Therefore, 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%.

Thus, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine the length of the mosaic Milo can create, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips available:**
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips.
   \[
   2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of square inches of mosaic that can be made with 144 chips:**
   It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height:**
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To determine the initial amount of tea in gallons at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total quantity of tea consumed and then add the remaining tea to this amount. 

First, let's calculate the total tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
  \[
  4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
  \[
  16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Next, we sum the tea consumed by all the students:
\[
6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
\]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the initial amount of tea is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea remaining:
\[
38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
\]

To convert quarts to gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts):
\[
48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Initial Stock**: Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.
2. **Sales**: He sold 150 butterscotch candies.
3. **Additional Order**: After selling 150, he ordered 100 more candies.

First, we calculate the deficit after selling 150 candies:
- Dale sold 150 candies but only had 100 initially, so he was short by \(150 - 100 = 50\) candies.

Next, we account for the additional 100 candies he ordered:
- After ordering 100 more candies, he now has \(100 - 50 = 50\) candies left.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

   - **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

3. **Number of students at the end of May:** 320 students.

4. **Number of additional students who joined by the end of May:**
   - Total students at the end of May: 320
   - Initial number of students: 10
   - Additional students: \(320 - 10 = 310\)

Thus, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed over the week. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 during the week, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Thus, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To determine the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends at the arcade, we need to calculate the duration each person can play with one quarter and then find out how many quarters each person uses over the 4-hour period.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), Jack can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Two Friends' Play Time:**
   - Each of these two friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes per quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), each of these friends can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - Since there are two such friends, the total quarters used by both is:
     \[
     24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **One Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes per quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), this friend can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Summing up the quarters used by all four friends:
     \[
     12 \text{ quarters (Jack)} + 48 \text{ quarters (two friends)} + 8 \text{ quarters (one friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
     \]

5. **Total Money Spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount of money spent is:
     \[
     68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information. Let \( z \) represent the amount of citrus zest in ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Similarly, the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, which is \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( z = 1 \) back into the expression for the amount of oil:
\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \( 3 \times 500 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \( 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = \( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \) dollars.

Thus, John spent a total of $4500.

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of Magic Cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we solve for \( P \):

\[ 7P = 341 - 12 \]
\[ 7P = 329 \]
\[ P = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P = 47 \), we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the amount of money Milly will lose, we need to consider both the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive from Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each of her activities and then sum these times.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly time spent recording videos: \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - Monthly time spent recording videos (4 weeks): \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours each week writing songs.
   - Weekly time spent writing songs: 2 hours.
   - Monthly time spent writing songs (4 weeks): \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup six days a week.
   - Weekly time spent doing makeup: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.

"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to first determine the number of additional items she requires beyond the standard package. The standard package includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed.

First, let's calculate the additional items:
- Mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\) additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\) additional chandelier
- Pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\) additional pictures

Adding these together, the total number of additional items is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 \]

Each additional item costs $15.00, so the cost for the additional items is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

The base installation fee is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela is:
\[ 129 + 195 = 324 \]

Thus, the total cost for Angela's installation is:

"To determine how much money Roy has, we start by identifying the amounts saved by Anthony and Eva. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Roy has saved:

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can break down his journey into two segments and then sum the distances of each segment.

1. For the first segment, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance for this segment can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second segment, after taking some rest, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. The distance for this segment is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance traveled, we sum the distances of both segments:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how the number of animals affects the total travel time.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory made:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes}
   \]
3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we sum the dishes made by each:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom has given her $80.
5. She still needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop.

Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine the number of apple slices left after Adam eats, we first calculate the total number of slices from the apples he has sliced. 

A large apple yields 5 slices, and a small apple yields 3 slices. Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current daily milk production:
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - The farmer has 3 cows.
   - Therefore, the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.

2. Determine the additional milk needed to reach the target of 25 liters:
   - The target daily milk production is 25 liters.
   - The current daily milk production is 15 liters.
   - The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.

3. Calculate the number of additional cows required:
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - To produce an additional 10 liters, the farmer needs \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) more cows.

Thus, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each partially used glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) of its original length left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs to purchase a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800, we first calculate the total cost of these items:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, we account for the money Gabriel already has:

- From working on weekends: \$5,000
- From his brother: \$200

\[ \text{Total amount Gabriel has} = \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs \$5,600.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Jack has:**
   - Jack has 60 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**
   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
   - Therefore, the number of socks Jack has is:
     \[
     \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

3. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Therefore, the number of socks Peter has is:
     \[
     \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

4. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
   - Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is:
     \[
     \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. However, this is not the correct way to interpret the interest rate. The correct interpretation is that the interest rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the principal amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1 = 0.75 \) (or 75%).

So, the correct interest rate \( r \) is 0.75.

- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

\[ I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ I = 675 \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 675 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of these shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts with no collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 of them have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of these shirts have buttons.

4. **Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 of them have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of goats sold from each farm. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we determine the number of goats remaining in each farm:
- For Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats.
- For Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from each farm:
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\).

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we need to follow a straightforward calculation process.

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This is calculated as:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Doubling this amount for the third year gives:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]

Adding the homes built over the three years, we get:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \text{ homes}

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- My brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to purchase, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required for his class. Given that there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required, knowing that each pack contains 8 glue sticks. We divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he must round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all students. Therefore, he needs to buy:

\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Thus, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we start with the initial number of infected individuals and calculate the spread of the infection day by day.

**Initial Condition:**
- Day 0: 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is:

3430"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating the total tips received by Rafaela. Given that each of the forty customers tipped her $20, the total amount of tips Rafaela received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

To find the combined total of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is:

1520"
"To determine how many oranges Jennifer has remaining, we start with the total number of oranges she initially purchased, which is 12. She then distributed these oranges among her children. Specifically, she gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, and 3 oranges to her only son. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we add the 3 oranges given to her son:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Subtracting the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, Jennifer remains with 3 oranges.

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each individual earns in a year and then determine the difference between Wendy's and Amber's badge counts.

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - Over 12 months, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, meaning she earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - Over 12 months, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.
   - Over 12 months, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number of badges Amber earns is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine the total amount of money raised by Paige from selling all the slices of banana bread, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked:**
   Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

2. **Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked:**
   Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she baked:
   \[
   2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of slices from all the loaves:**
   Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Thus, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money raised by selling all the slices:**
   Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount of money raised is:
   \[
   80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables. Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of books is 85: \( S + A + F = 85 \).
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, we first need to calculate the total amount each person contributes to the monthly grocery bill. Given that the total monthly cost is $400 and Madeline pays 60% of this amount, we can calculate Madeline's contribution as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's contribution} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's contribution is the remaining amount:

\[ \text{Keenan's contribution} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly contribution by the number of weeks in the month:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly contribution} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Keenan spends 40 dollars per week on groceries.

"To determine how many more glasses of lemonade Julie sold compared to Micah, we start by calculating the number of glasses sold by the boys. Given that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses, and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find the total number of glasses sold by the boys as follows:

\[ \text{Total glasses sold by the boys} = 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by each boy} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost for these is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, we sum up the total costs of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly’s budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Kelly has \(\boxed{5}\) dollars left in her budget."

"To address the problem, we start by calculating the number of microphones that cannot be paired. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones do not fit into the arrangement, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left unpaired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be formed is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Determine the number of flowering plants:**
   - Subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - Divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, based on the provided relationships and the speed of a whatchamacallit.

1. **Identify the speed of a thingamabob:**
   - A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
   - A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
   - Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of a whirligig:**
   - A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.
   - Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
     \]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is:

"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Ellen's daily diet consists of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt, with a total cost of $11. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad.

First, let's calculate the cost of the yogurt:
\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of salad} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:
\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of all items is $11, the cost of the two carrots can be found by subtracting the total cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of two carrots} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the two carrots by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Thus, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to break down the information provided and perform a few calculations.

1. **Identify the payments and the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the payment per lawn mowed:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we assume this is the total payment for all the lawns she mowed, we need to find the payment per lawn.
   - If \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume \( J \) is 1 for simplicity), then the total payment for 9 lawns is $6.
   - Therefore, the payment per lawn = \( \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \) dollars per lawn.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9J \times \frac{2}{3} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $6.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74.

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Given that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the initial number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Initial number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup available:**
   - The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Calculate the amount of soup used for dinner:**
   - Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl.
   - 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Therefore, 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife) are equivalent to \(2 \times 2 = 4\) child bowls.

3. **Calculate the remaining soup after dinner:**
   - The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup.
   - After using 4 child bowls for dinner, the remaining soup is \(8 - 4 = 4\) child bowls.

4. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:**
   - Calvin has two children.
   - The remaining 4 child bowls of soup can be divided among the two children.
   - Each child will get \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bowls of soup for lunch.

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first determine the material required for each type of mask individually.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for one small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the total material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for one large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the total material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket for the Fast and the Furious movies, we need to follow a straightforward calculation process. 

First, we calculate the total number of movie viewings:
- Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of viewings is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \).

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- Deepa spent a total of $216 on these viewings.
- The average price per ticket is the total amount spent divided by the total number of viewings: 
  \[
  \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to account for the hours he spends on various activities and subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we sum the hours spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Harold has 5 hours of free time each day.

"To address the problem, we start by identifying the initial quantities of blue and red shoe boxes in Tim's possession. Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. 

Next, we calculate the number of shoe boxes used for fishing. Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 9 is 3 red shoe boxes.

Subtracting the used shoe boxes from the initial quantities, we find:
- Blue shoe boxes left: \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- Red shoe boxes left: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of shoe boxes left:
- Total shoe boxes left: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \)

Thus, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age, and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.
   \[ D = 60 \]

2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   \[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the second equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total expenditure and then divide it by two, as they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Adding these costs together:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since the total cost of $28 was spent by combining their allowances, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to consider the time it takes for each trip and the total time available.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect a total of 24 berries.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, the initial volume of water in the tank is:

\[ \frac{10,000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Therefore, the total volume of water used over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining volume of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total volume of water used from the initial volume of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to consider the calorie content of the mini versions of the pastries and the quantities baked.

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, the calories in a mini cinnamon roll = \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

2. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, the calories in a mini blueberry muffin = \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

3. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

4. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:**

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days. We then divide this total by the number of days to find the average.

Here are the numbers of Junebugs removed each day:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

First, we sum these values:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

The total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

Next, we calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of days:
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:
\[

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle covered.

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using the 12-hour option plus the additional hours, and then compare it to the cost of a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12), the hotel charges 70 pesos per hour.

First, we calculate the cost of the additional hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, we add this to the cost of the initial 12 hours:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the individual requirements for the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay for his livestock.

"To determine how many 25-dollar pens John can buy after his expenses, we first calculate his total earnings for the week. Given that John earns 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours, his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we account for his expenses. John spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. Subtracting these expenses from his total earnings:

\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also buys 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25-dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

Thus, John can buy 4 pens.

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Given that the book is printed on paper with a density of 100 pages per inch and each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, we can calculate the total number of pages in a 1.5-inch thick book as follows:

1. Determine the number of pages per inch: 100 pages.
2. Multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches: \( 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \).

\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Thus, the book contains 150 pages.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this time into minutes, we have:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he can staple is:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

"To calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep duration without interruptions:**
   - Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Total time subtracted = Time spent sleepwalking + Time woke up early
   - Total time subtracted = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time on the bed = Total sleep duration without interruptions - Total time subtracted
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Given that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over the 2-week period. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these newly admitted patients to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we start by breaking down the total number of emails she sends and categorizing them.

1. **Total emails sent per day**: 16
2. **Work emails**: 7

First, we calculate the number of non-work emails:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we determine how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. The remaining emails are:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"Given the information, we can establish the following relationships:

1. Shawna's age is three times Aliya's age.
2. Shawna's father's age is five times Shawna's age.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

First, we calculate Shawna's age:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. If Courtney reported 48 people, this number is 20% more than the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) represent the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

"Given the problem, we can set up a system to determine the total number of basketballs based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( J \). According to the problem:

- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which implies \( J = 1 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of balls each person carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe,
- \( S \) as the number of Pokémon caught by Stan,
- \( X \) as the number of Pokémon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( A + S + X = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[ A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \]
Simplify:
\[ A + 8A - 26 = 334 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
Simplify:
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Thus, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the number of students leaving early from Mr. Roper's class, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the number of football players:**
   - 20% of the class are football players.
   - Total number of students in the class = 30.
   - Number of football players = 20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining students:**
   - Total students = 30.
   - Number of football players = 6.
   - Remaining students = 30 - 6 = 24 students.

3. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members:**
   - 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.
   - Number of cheerleaders or band members = 25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

4. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early:**
   - Number of football players = 6.
   - Number of cheerleaders or band members = 6.
   - Total number of students leaving early = 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To determine the total cost Pat will incur to fill her flower bed, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space required per plant, including the space between plants:**
   Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. Therefore, the total space required per plant, including the space between plants, is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. The number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   Each plant costs $6. The total cost for 27 plants is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To determine the total cost Katherine will incur for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to break down the costs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will contain 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, the total cost for all 5 baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00/\text{basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate the amount she saves each month for this purpose. Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly income for fancy shoes. 

The monthly savings for shoes is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we calculate her annual savings for shoes:
\[ \text{Annual Savings} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:
\[ \text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Rate of peeling}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the number of batches needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per batch}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time required to complete both tasks is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature change, we need to calculate the net effect of the air conditioner's operation and the room's natural warming.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on low: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we sum the total cooling and subtract the total warming to find the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.
- Net temperature change: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine Bill's age when he first saw Comet Halley, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time at 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes:

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill. Therefore, the number of checks per year is:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill. Therefore, the number of checks per year is:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes 2 checks per month for the church. Therefore, the number of checks per year is:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Therefore, the number of checks per year is:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we start by defining the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

Given that the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each:
\[ \frac{1}{8}F \]

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Thus, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by noting the total age of the four children, which is 20 years. We are given the ages of Akbar and Alessandro as 3 and 4 years, respectively. Let's denote the ages of Helene and Wilfred as \( H \) and \( W \), respectively.

The equation for the total age is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice this average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is:

The total amount collected from these sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer has offered to donate three times the total amount collected from all other sources. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we first calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices, in terms of \( x \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Thus, the total watermelon is \( 8x \).

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we first need to calculate the number of laps each individual can run based on the given information:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, which means Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, which means Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we compare the number of laps Bethany can run to the number of laps Quinn can run:

- Bethany runs 10 laps.
- Quinn runs 5 laps.

The difference in the number of laps is \(10 - 5 = 5\).

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To determine the amount of water remaining to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, accounting for the rate of discharge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours at 7% Loss:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours at 9% Loss:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 58.9%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

58.9%"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Determine Janet's total hourly earnings:**
   Janet earns $10 per hour from her wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   \[
   \text{Total hourly earnings} = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:**
   Janet works 40 hours per week.
   \[
   \text{Total weekly earnings} = 25 \times 40 = 1000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of weeks required to save the down payment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total weekly earnings}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices and quantities are as follows:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Summing these amounts gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[ 1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25 \]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:

\[ 10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75 \]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[ \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of pieces in the box. The box contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces gives us the number of pieces she gave away:

\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of 3 to account for the three-year period:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this factor by the initial price to find the future price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

"To determine the total number of selfies and portraits, we start by calculating the number of pictures in each album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and evenly distributed them into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain only selfies. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

Similarly, 2 of the albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Total number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits combined, we add the two quantities:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

"Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can determine his reading rate as follows:

\[ \text{Reading Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of Pages}}{\text{Reading Rate}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve the problem, we start with the initial number of guests at the hotel, which is 100. We then account for the checkouts and check-ins throughout the day.

1. **Initial Guests**: 100
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests leave, so the number of guests remaining is \(100 - 24 = 76\).
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests leave, so the number of guests remaining is \(76 - 15 = 61\).
4. **Afternoon Check-ins**: Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests check in, so the number of guests now is \(61 + 30 = 91\).
5. **Evening Check-ins**: 7 more guests check in after dinner, so the number of guests now is \(91 + 7 = 98\).

Thus, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) represent the price of a large stuffed animal. According to the problem, the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, so \( S = 4 \). The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Next, let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Price of small stuffed animal} \times \text{Number of small stuffed animals sold}) + (\text{Price of large stuffed animal} \times \text{Number of large stuffed animals sold}) \]
\[ 120 = 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption for each family member and then sum these amounts to find the weekly total.

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

The total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per day is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \]

To find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we first calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. 

The earnings from the cookies are calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

The earnings from the cupcakes are calculated as follows:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Adding these amounts gives the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we account for the money given to her two sisters. Each sister received \$10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Subtracting this amount from the total earnings gives the amount of money Suzanne has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Therefore, Suzanne has \$300 left from her earnings.

"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over a 30-day period, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily mining rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the mining rate doubles: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the mining rate is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate over 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then over 30 days they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To calculate the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Richard will take to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the total financial impact of Jim's decision to go to college, including both the cost of the loans and the income he foregoes by not working during his studies. We then need to determine how long it will take for him to earn back this total amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to complete his degree.
   - He takes out $50,000 in loans each year.
   - Total loans: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the income foregone during college:**
   - Jim had a job paying $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income foregone: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total financial impact:**
   - Total cost of loans and foregone income: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Calculate the time required to earn back the total financial impact:**
   - Total amount to earn back: \( 300,000 \) dollars.
   - New annual income: \( 75,000 \) dollars.
   - Time to earn back the total amount: \( \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \) years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income he lost while in school.

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we start by calculating the dimensions of the fabric required for each piece. The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width. Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum of letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To determine the average loss Johnny's dad experienced over the day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Next, we calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their summer growth, we first need to convert all measurements to a consistent unit. We will use inches for this calculation.

1. **Xavier's Initial Height:**
   - Xavier was initially 4 feet tall.
   - Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Xavier's Growth:**
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's new height is:
     \[
     48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Cole's Initial Height:**
   - Cole was initially 50 inches tall.

4. **Cole's Growth:**
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's new height is:
     \[
     50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Difference in Height:**
   - The difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights is:
     \[
     52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
     \]

Thus, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem into a series of steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours worked each day is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is \(9 \times 21 = 189\) hours.

5. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is \(\frac{189}{4} = 47.25\) hours.

Thus, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem statement:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of mailing all coupons:**
   Add the costs of the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents equal 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[
245

"To determine the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we start by calculating the initial number of sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which can be expressed as:

10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches

Next, Mark ate 4 of these sandwiches, leaving Sidney with:

7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches

Sidney then ordered an additional 3 sandwiches, bringing the total number of sandwiches Sidney had to:

3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Each sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 6 remaining sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

"To address the problem, we start by identifying the total number of trucks dispatched and the amount of fertiliser each truck was carrying. Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

Next, we need to determine how many of these trucks experienced mechanical failures. The problem states that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical issues. Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means that 5 trucks were unable to deliver their fertiliser. Consequently, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ \text{Number of trucks that successfully delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the current promotion, we need to break down the calculation step by step.

1. **Identify the total butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will require:
   \[
   6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the third pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, the cost is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.

4. **Sum the costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"To determine the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left after their expenditures, we first calculate the amount each spent and then subtract these amounts from their initial funds.

Maggie initially had $60 and spent a quarter of it:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Thus, the amount Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also initially had $60 and spent one-third of it:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Thus, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the remaining amounts of both Maggie and Riza gives:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is:

"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the total daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remainder for the third monkey.

1. **Daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

2. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, which is \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas.

3. **Total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:**
   - Combined, the first and second monkeys eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas each day.

4. **Total weekly consumption of the first and second monkeys:**
   - Over a week, the first and second monkeys together eat \(24 \times 7 = 168\) bananas.

5. **Total weekly consumption of all three monkeys:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is the total weekly consumption for all three monkeys.

6. **Total weekly consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas: \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which can be broken down into 12 roses and 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 roses at $2 each is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of 15 roses is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5-dollar bills, so the total amount of money she has is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money she has minus the total cost of the roses.
   - The change is \(25 - 21 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 4 quarters, 4 dollars is equal to \(4 \times 4 = 16\) quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul's train, we need to calculate the sequence of events and the time intervals between them.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring produces one jellyfish per second.

First, let's convert the time period from hours to seconds:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 14,400 seconds:
- One spring produces 1 jellyfish per second.
- Therefore, in 14,400 seconds, one spring produces 14,400 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish produced by one spring by 5:
- 5 springs * 14,400 jellyfish/spring = 72,000 jellyfish

Thus, the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider the entire journey he made, including the detour back home.

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway point**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

James walked 2 miles to the halfway point, then realized he forgot something and walked back home, covering another 2 miles. After returning home, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

3. **Total distance walked**:
   - 2 miles (to the halfway point)
   - 2 miles (back home)
   - 4 miles (from home to the store)

   Total distance = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

4. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine the savings Jenny achieved by purchasing bananas in bunches rather than individually, we need to compare the total costs of both purchasing methods.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny purchased 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought the bananas individually:
- The cost per banana is $0.80.
- The total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- The cost per bunch is $3.00.
- The total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, we determine the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information provided. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets. According to the problem:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]
\[
S = 20
\]

Thus, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

4. **MTB Bicycles Sold**:
   - The remaining bicycles were MTB bikes.
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the revenue from each type of bicycle:

- **Price of MTB**: $500
- **Price of BMX**: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
- **Price of Trekking**: $450

5. **Revenue from MTB**:
   - \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
6. **Revenue from BMX**:
   - \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
7. **Revenue from Trekking**:
   - \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of a 6-hour workday, we need to consider both the rate at which the farmer produces bales and the rate at which the truck removes them.

1. **Bales produced by the farmer:**
   - The farmer produces 5 bales per hour.
   - Over a 6-hour period, the total number of bales produced is:
     \[
     5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales}
     \]

2. **Bales picked up by the truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over a 6-hour period, the total number of bales picked up is:
     \[
     3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales}
     \]

3. **Net number of bales left in the field:**
   - The net number of bales left in the field is the difference between the bales produced and the bales picked up:
     \[
     30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales}

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week:**
   - John has 6 regular periods each day and 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods per day.
   - He attends classes 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of periods per week is:
     \[
     8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class each week:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total minutes spent in class each week is:
     \[
     40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday.
   - The extra learning time for each day is:
     \[
     \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
     \[
     100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

5. **Convert the total minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To determine the height the bouncy ball reaches on its second bounce, we start by calculating the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Given that each story in the mall is 24 feet high and the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, after the first bounce, the height the ball reaches is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the ball will again reach \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

"To determine the earnings of the apple orchard, we first need to calculate the number of bags sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag. The price per bag is $5:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

   \]

2. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, leaving:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. The group of Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"To determine the probability that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the remaining sodas and their states (shaken or unshaken) step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of remaining sodas.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we first need to calculate the distance each train travels individually. 

The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Over 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. Over 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is:
270 miles"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

2. **Determine the number of days Billy takes off:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   - Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

3. **Calculate the number of days Billy works:**
   - Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps:**
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
   - People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
   - Total people helped = People helped per day * Number of days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

Thus, the total number of people Billy helps is:

"To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we start by calculating the distance Micah ran. Given that Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we sum the distances run by Amber and Micah:

\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Since the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{T}{5} \]

It is also given that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \]

We know from the problem statement that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding the given information: 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Population} = 240 \]

To find the total population of the school, we solve for the total population:

\[ \text{Total Population} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since the total population is 600 and there are 240 boys, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Population} - \text{Number of Boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift. 

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \(2 \times 60 = 120\) toys.

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \(2 \times 40 = 80\) toys.

3. **Total production by the four workers:**
   - The total number of toys produced by the four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

4. **Determine the total number of toys needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

5. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - The total production by all five workers is 380 toys.
   - The production by the four workers is 200 toys.
   - Therefore, the production by the fifth worker is \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

6. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - The hourly production of the fifth worker is \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which means he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
4. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had a total of \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
5. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. Calculate half the circumference of the Earth:
   \[
   \text{Half the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, given that he flies 400 kilometers each day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can follow a step-by-step approach based on the information provided:

1. The average car can travel at 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

First, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
750 mph"
"To determine Vince's current age, we start by establishing the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago. Given that Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age. Let \( V \) represent Vince’s age two years ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To determine how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we start by breaking down the information provided:

1. **Total eggs painted by all four individuals:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:
     \[
     S + (S + 12) = 30
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
     \[
     S = 9
     \]
   - So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

4. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - The total number of eggs painted by all four individuals is 56.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs is:
     \[
     2A + 30 = 56
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2A = 26
     \]
     \[
     A = 13
     \]
   - So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

5. **Difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8
     \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8. The number of groups (and thus the number of boxes) is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes gives:
   \[
   200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is:
   \[
   \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we start by calculating each individual's earnings.

1. **Valerie's Earnings:**
   Valerie earns $5000 per month.

2. **Brother's Earnings:**
   Valerie's earnings are half of her brother's earnings. Therefore, her brother's earnings are:
   \[
   \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000
   \]

3. **Combined Earnings of Valerie and Her Brother:**
   The combined earnings of Valerie and her brother are:
   \[
   \text{Combined earnings} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000
   \]

4. **Mother's Earnings:**
   Their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, her mother's earnings are:
   \[
   \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000
   \]

5. **Total Amount of Money:**
   The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000

"To determine the total time Grandma spends on her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, considering the different walking speeds.

1. **Calculate the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we start by calculating her current savings. Jane has been saving $4 each week for the past 8 weeks. Therefore, her current savings are:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To determine the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10, we first need to establish how many marbles he currently has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the current number of marbles, \( x \):

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to use the principle of heat balance. When two different temperatures of water are mixed, the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures, based on the volumes of water mixed.

Given:
- The temperature of the first mug of water, \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug, \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug, \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce.
- The final temperature of the mixed water, \( T_f \geq 40 \) degrees.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:
\[ T_f = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in both cows and chickens over the 21 days and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

4. **Total number of cows after three weeks**:
   50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows

5. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
6. **Chickens added per day**: 10
7. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks**:
   20 initial chickens + 210 added chickens = 230 chickens

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost. We calculate the discount amount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Next, we determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to calculate the number of scoops of mashed potatoes he consumed. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be broken down as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs consumed over the two periods.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozens} \]

Thus, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To determine the average speed of Sid's travel, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The formula for average speed is:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part of the journey.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in the second part of the journey.
- Therefore, the total distance is \( 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \).

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Sid spent 2 hours on the first part of the journey.
- Sid spent an additional 3 hours on the second part of the journey.
- Therefore, the total time is \( 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we can calculate the average speed:

"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he consumes on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, for the weekdays (Monday through Friday), Mason eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, for the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 weekend days, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots consumed on weekdays and weekends gives the total weekly consumption:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To address the problem of determining how many additional bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to meet the full daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can break down the problem into a few clear steps:

1. **Determine the total number of bottles required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the current production capacity of Hortex:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the current production:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles of carrot juice to meet the full daily energy needs of 2300 people.

2. **Number of octuplets dressed in purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
3. **Number of octuplets dressed in blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to determine how many of these octuplets are wearing bows:

- **All blue-wearers wear bows**: 2
- **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:

- **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

We are asked to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as follows:

- **Number of purple-wearers with bows**: 2
- **Total number of babies with bows**: 4

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of babies with bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can use the following approach:

1. **Total Reports Last Week**: The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.
2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: The total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday combined is 1907.
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: The total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday combined is 2136.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we subtract the sum of the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports Last Week} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, calculate the sum of the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of reports received last week:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the annual fruit production for each year from age 5 to age 10 and then sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: The tree produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: The tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: The tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to determine the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: The tree does not produce any fruits, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: The tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can determine the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which is \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Next, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

The total number of fruits produced over 10 years is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes using algebraic expressions. Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. According to the problem:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money that Ronnie and Rissa have. Ronnie is given $5, and Rissa is given three times as much, which is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gives to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, this amount is \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to determine how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to break down the scoring for both halves and for both teams.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

"To address the problem, we need to calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received for the expired milk. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:**
   - The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   - Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000.

2. **Determine the amount of milk that was expired:**
   - 2/5 of the milk was expired.
   - Amount of expired milk = (2/5) * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

3. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The refund is for the expired milk, which is 1600 gallons.
   - Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5,600.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we start by calculating the total number of books he can purchase with his $27,000 budget. Given that 100 books cost $500, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing these books equally among 3 schools, the number of books each school will receive is:

\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples Newton brought home, we can break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples at each step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Next, we sum the apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - The net number of snowballs Jay can accumulate in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To determine the initial number of bandages the nurses' station had on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days and the final count of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: \( 50 - 38 = 12 \) bandages added

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( 38 - 10 = 28 \)
   - Bandages ordered: 0
   - Net change: \( -28 \) bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) (half a pack)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Net change: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) bandages added

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \) bandages
- Second day: \( -28 \) bandages
- Third day: \( +75 \) bandages

Total net change:
\[ 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \] bandages added

Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can determine the initial number of bandages by subtracting the total net change from the final count:

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red and black pens separately and then sum them up.

1. **Red Pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
     \[
     5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
     \]

2. **Black Pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
   - Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
     \]
   - Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
     \[
     10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Pens:**

"To determine the total amount John spends, we first calculate the cost per bottle of scotch. Given that John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, the cost per bottle is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys, which is twice the number of scotch bottles:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Day 1:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Day 2:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\).
- For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than the 40 he planted on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, making the total for the second day \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:

"To determine the distance the last dog needs to walk, we can use the concept of the average distance walked by the dogs. Given that the average distance is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, the total distance walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distances walked by the first three dogs are:
- The first dog: 1 mile
- The second dog: 4 miles
- The third dog: 3 miles

Summing these distances gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To determine the amount of money John has left after paying off his debts, we first need to calculate the total loan amount he received. Given that his house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value, the loan amount is:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we calculate the portion of the loan that John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount for this purpose:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Thus, the amount of money John has left after paying off his debts is:

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Summing the total water removed from all settings:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes. According to the problem, the number of brownies \( b \) is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

We also know that Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs to accommodate all her books, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. 

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the books each shelf can hold:
   \[
   20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \[
   \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes, and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   \[
   S + B = 116
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
S + 5S - 4 = 116
\]
\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]
\[
6S = 120
\]
\[
S = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 5(20) - 4
\]
\[
B = 100 - 4
\]
\[
B = 96
\]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is:
\[
96

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples compared to the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed for the pool party is:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the regular lemonade.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the number of lemons needed for 2 cups of lemon juice is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - Adding the lemons needed for the pool party and Allen's extra gallon:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by identifying the quantities of the other blocks and then use the total number of blocks to find the unknown quantity.

Given:
- The tower consists of 4 blue blocks.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks.
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

First, calculate the number of yellow blocks:
\[
\text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Next, calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks:
\[
\text{Total number of blue and yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
\]

Now, subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks:
\[
\text{Number of red blocks} = \text{Total number of blocks} - \text{Total number of blue and yellow blocks} = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of red blocks is:
\[

"To determine how much money Janet has left after her shopping trip, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract this from the $40 her parents gave her.

1. **Ice Cream**: $3.50
2. **Movie Tickets**: $7.50 per ticket for two people, which totals \( 7.50 \times 2 = 15.00 \)
3. **Bracelet**: $8.50

Adding these amounts together gives the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Next, we subtract the total expenditure from the $40 Janet initially had:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left.

"To determine Josh's earnings over a period of 2 weeks, we need to consider the following:

1. **Days of Operation**: Josh operates his car shop 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), as he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday.
2. **Daily Car Service**: He services 3 cars each day.
3. **Earnings per Car**: He earns $4 for each car serviced.

First, we calculate the number of cars serviced in one week:
\[ \text{Cars per week} = 3 \, \text{cars/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 15 \, \text{cars/week} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 15 \, \text{cars/week} \times 4 \, \text{dollars/car} = 60 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings over 2 weeks:
\[ \text{Earnings for 2 weeks} = 60 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 2 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (one of each flavor):**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

5. **Baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, we sum up the total number of cookies:
- Total cookies = 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

Thus, the total number of cookies Randy has now is 23."

"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we calculate the number of days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we start by calculating the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we need to subtract the quantities of the other types of cookies from the total number of cookies. The total number of cookies is 7995, which includes 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. 

The calculation is as follows:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Rainbow cookies} - \text{Oatmeal cookies} \]
\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 2595 - 3075 \]

First, subtract the number of rainbow cookies:
\[ 7995 - 2595 = 5400 \]

Next, subtract the number of oatmeal cookies:
\[ 5400 - 3075 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies is 2325.

"To determine the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to analyze the given information and set up an equation based on the items he actually placed on the lab bench.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables and then determine how many screws will be left over from the 40 screws James has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Distance Run by Each:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Time Taken by Aaron:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

3. **Speed of Aaron:**
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Speed of Vanessa:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

5. **Time Taken by Vanessa:**
   - To find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Time per mile}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To address the requirement for the caretaker of the docks, we need to calculate the total length of line needed based on the given ratio and the current length of the dock. The caretaker requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Given that the dock is 200 feet long, the total line required is:

\[ 3 \, \text{feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \, \text{feet of dock} = 600 \, \text{feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line needed is:

\[ 600 \, \text{feet of line} - 6 \, \text{feet of line} = 594 \, \text{feet of line} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we start by calculating the total cost and the total profit, then find the total selling price, and finally, the price per watermelon.

1. **Total Cost**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
2. **Total Profit**: The profit is 25% of the total cost. 
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Total Selling Price**: The total selling price is the sum of the total cost and the total profit.
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Selling Price per Watermelon**: The selling price per watermelon is the total selling price divided by the number of watermelons.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Thus, John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the peeling rates for both individuals and then find the difference in the number of oranges they can each peel in 60 minutes.

1. **Ana's peeling rate:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), Ana can peel:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Jane's peeling rate:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), Jane can peel:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference between the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

This gives us the following system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is \( 5 \).
