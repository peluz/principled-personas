"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total investment.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens:**
   - Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Total daily feed requirement = 3 cups/chicken/day * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed already given:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
   - Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total daily feed requirement = 60 cups.
   - Feed already given = 40 cups.
   - Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the distance John travels away from home:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back home during the 4 hours:
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, add the distances he traveled back home:
- Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Finally, subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, then she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.

2. **Calculate the remaining vacuum cleaners after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another hour

This means she has covered 6 miles in 2 hours. The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour. The total time required to achieve this average speed is:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
   - Cost per red tie = 40 + 0.5 * 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = 600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on ties = 200 + 600 = 800

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

"To determine how much money Bailey started with, we need to account for the total amount she had at the end of 8 weeks and subtract the total allowance she received over that period.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. The total allowance over 8 weeks is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received as allowance. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the $40 from the total amount:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:**
   - On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, the total number of classes is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
   - On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

2. **Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:**
   - Each class has 15 students.
   - So, the total number of students in a week is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:**
   - She charges $15.00 per student.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money she makes is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\) dollars.

So, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

"To solve this, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( W \) be the number of games won and \( L \) be the number of games lost. We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When cooked, the volume of the tomatoes is halved.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

The total number of cars initially is 30, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Poppy starts with a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
2. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board. So, she places:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. So, she places:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
5. After Poppy's mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then calculate the volume. 

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = \$100
  \]
- For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \times 24 = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  150 + 120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time. Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we can calculate her new salary as follows:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

- Therefore, the number of questions he completed in the first test is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions.
- The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed in the second test is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions.
- The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Total incomplete questions = \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs, and \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Finally, find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:

"To calculate how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[20 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate 14 of them.
   - Let the total number of fries be \( x \).
   - After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

2. A seagull stole the pack and ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
   - The remaining fries after the seagull ate are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
   - The total fries eaten by the pigeons are \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).
   - The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - The number of fries the raccoon took is \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \).
   - The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

5. Ants carried off one fry.
   - The remaining fries after the ants took one are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

6. Five fries were left.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means each increase is 20% of $20, which is $4.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, over 36 months, there will be 36 / 2 = 18 increases.

4. **Multiplier for Each Increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

5. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

6. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator, \((1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376\).
   - Therefore, the final price is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752

"To figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: calculating the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and calculating the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine How Much More Likely It Is to Roll a Number Greater Than 3
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

2. **First Batch of New Pens**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens.
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. From these, he can make 1 more full pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the sum of the initial pens, the first batch of new pens, and the second batch of new pens.

25 (initial) + 5 (first batch) + 1 (second batch) = 31

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can determine Robert's candies by dividing John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - So, the total number of letters he receives each week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of pages he needs to write in response:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Since he responds in kind, he needs to write \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages each week.

4. **Calculate the total time he spends writing these pages:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

Thus, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total minutes used for daily calls with his boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Add the extra minutes used for calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Calculate the total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Determine the minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the given information and setting up the necessary equations.

We have two aquariums:
- The first aquarium has 4 snails.
- The second aquarium has 32 snails.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

The problem states that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ 7 \]

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, calculate the daily cost:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \]

Next, calculate the weekly cost:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \]

Then, calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

40"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's start by finding out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we can determine the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After the morning sales, the number of loaves remaining is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Hello! I'm Aparna, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa. Let's break down his expenses:

1. **Business Suits**: 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Suitcases**: 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 students fewer than each of the other groups, will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is:
60"
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after increasing his daily run by 1/5, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"Sure, let's calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects every day.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each, and the other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each every day.

First, we calculate the milk from the first half:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

Next, we calculate the milk from the second half:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then determine the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the remaining land is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation can be written as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

\text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
\[
\text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

He also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
\[
\text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Now, we add the new number of corns and cannolis to find the combined total:
\[
\text{Combined total} = 100 + 60 = 160
\]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
160

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and then determine how many steps he needed to take to have 2,000 steps left.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Total steps needed to reach 10,000:
10,000 - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog:
8,000 (total steps needed) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book:**
   - The book is 45 pages long.
   - Each page has an average of 200 words.
   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport:**
   - Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.
   - It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
   - Time available to read = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Determine how early Toby will be:**
   - Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes.
   - Time left after reading = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

"To find out how much Tim spent in total on fireworks, let's break down the costs and apply the discount where applicable:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it is \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the first and second packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The total cost of the first and second packages after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 left for spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards sold:**
   - Kenny sells each card for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards.
   - The amount of money from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \).
   - \( C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( C = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hot dog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hot dogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hot dogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hot dog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.
   - The total number of hot dogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs.
   - The number of hot dogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hot dogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's drive time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine Wayne's departure time:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

5. **Calculate the difference in their departure times:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: 2 sheets/room * 80 rooms = 160 sheets
- **Total comforters**: 1 comforter/room * 80 rooms = 80 comforters
- **Total pillow cases**: 4 pillow cases/room * 80 rooms = 320 pillow cases
- **Total towels**: 8 towels/room * 80 rooms = 640 towels

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry:

160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = 1200 pieces of laundry

"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with all her sprinkles. 

Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs to bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in Marissa’s class.
   - Each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the information given. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are also told that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Since 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
\]

To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to consider the overlaps between the allergies. 

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Total: 9 + 6 = 15

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they have been counted twice. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
- Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total kids in the class: 32
- Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

"To figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oats Consumption for One Horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for Four Horses:**
   - Four horses eat 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - For five days, the total consumption is 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.

   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that provides the most sticks per dollar. However, since the question asks for the most sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we will focus on the 2 x 4 pieces.

4. **Calculating the Number of 2 x 4 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
   - With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To figure out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 sled dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Next, we need to determine the number of pairs of snowshoes:
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs needed = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, let's break down the costs:

1. Calculate the total cost of bus trips without the pass:
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips each day for 5 days a week.
   - Total bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - Total cost per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week.

2. Compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

3. Calculate the savings:
   - Savings = Total cost of bus trips without the pass - Cost of the weekly bus pass
   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- Total animals in the zoo: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

"To help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, starting from December 31st, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit he should aim for. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total number of days:**
   - From January 1 to July 19:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
   - Each pound requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 lbs = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of April compared to the first half. Let's break down the problem:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
3. Therefore, the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).
4. In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \).
5. The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
6. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]
7. We know the total savings should be $1125, so:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
9. The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars, with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day over the week, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

First, let's sum the total number of birds:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7):
\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

So, the average number of birds Mack saw each day is 40.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Starting value**: 20
2. **Half of the starting value**: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
3. **Sum of the starting value and half of the starting value**: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)
4. **Divide the sum by 5**: \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \)
5. **Starting value minus 12**: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \)
6. **Multiply the result from step 4 by the result from step 5**: \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

The final value of the number train is \( 48 \).

"To solve this, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

1. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
2. The difference is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
3. The percentage by which the oven is off is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to if she wants it to reach 520 degrees, given that it is off by 4%.

1. Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to.
2. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).
3. We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
   \[
   1.04x = 520
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
   \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To calculate the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets from mushrooms per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

Next, to find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour during this period were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. For 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total number of washes the bottle can provide. The bottle is designed to give 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes doubles:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The jumbo bottle costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy, taking into account the 30% discount.

The shirt costs $25, and the shorts cost $35. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Since there is a 30% discount, Joe will only pay 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Cost per month: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Cost per month for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, let's break down the information:

- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is 16 ounces (since 1 pound = 16 ounces).
- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - This amount is half of the total sales from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \).

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \).

3. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Total sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \).

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly hanger rental is $5,000.
3. The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000.

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal, we first add up the signatures they already have:

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:
\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much she earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then determine how much this exceeds the elevator's maximum load.

1. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
2. Jack and 8 other adults make a total of 9 people.
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out how much the total weight exceeds this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Therefore, Max has \( 68 + 5 = 73 \) cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \( 73 - 12 = 61 \) cookies.

3. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
   - Therefore, Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Katarina: 68 cookies
   - Max: 73 cookies
   - Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
   - Summer: 96 cookies
   - Total: \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \) cookies

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time to mow the entire lawn in each mode:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes.
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to mow half of the lawn in each mode:**
   - Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.
   - Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Add the times to find the total time to mow the lawn:**
   - Total time = Time in ""turtle"" mode + Time in ""rabbit"" mode
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost for the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rong's Monthly Savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Neil's Monthly Savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong.
   - First, calculate 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}
     \]
   - Therefore, Neil saves:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
     \]

3. **Total Savings Over Ten Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
     \[
     10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Rong's total savings over ten years:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]
   - Neil's total savings over ten years:
     \[
     28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
     \]

4. **Combined Total Savings:**
   - Add Rong's and Neil's total savings:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \).

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost for bananas: $5
- Total cost for apples: $6
- Total cost for oranges: $21

The total price for the crate is \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the fireworks from two sources: the city's display and the ones she sets off herself.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:
- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks in the city's display is \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks.

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her house:
- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- So, the number of fireworks she can see from the city's display is \( 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \) fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah has 3 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.
- Therefore, the total number of fireworks she will set off is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the fireworks she sets off herself to find the total number of fireworks she will see:

"Sure, let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item:
- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. We calculate the discount amount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final total:
- Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with her $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's determine how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Candy:**
   - Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy.

2. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

3. **Total Days:**
   - We need to calculate the amount of candy left after two weeks, which is 14 days.

4. **Total Candy Consumed:**
   - Ginger's total consumption in 14 days: \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy's total consumption in 14 days: \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \)

5. **Candy Left After 14 Days:**
   - Ginger's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \)
   - Amy's remaining candy: \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \)

6. **Difference in Candy:**
   - The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger: \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \)

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To find out how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of Buying Blueberries at the Store:**
   - Cost per pound of blueberries at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 people, so there are 5 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, we divide the total by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40%
4. **Number of girls in each class**: To find the number of girls, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

5. **Number of boys in each class**: To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the journey into the driving and hiking portions and calculate the distance for each.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To solve this, let's break it down:

- For 5 days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times each day.
  - So, for these 5 days: \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

- For the remaining 2 days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days.
  - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
  - So, for these 2 days: \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

- Adding the rides from both sets of days:
  - Total rides in a week: \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding these 17 fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \)
3. After adding these 17 fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \)

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \[
   4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the tea consumed by both groups:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. Convert quarts to gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   \[
   48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To solve this, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed on average each day. First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, we find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days in a week.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce salt scrub.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, let's start by calculating the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down:

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows required is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To figure out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first add up the total cost of the car and the phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Next, we add up the money Gabriel already has. He has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, which totals $5000 + $200 = $5200.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. He buys six squirt guns, each costing $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. He also buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total amount spent on both the squirt guns and the water balloons is:
   \[
   12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

   \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total number of socks:
  \[
  \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
  \]
- Total number of dishes:
  \[
  \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, I'll start by calculating the total time available for performances, excluding the intermission. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 110 minutes left for the performances.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group. 

To find out how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes, I divide 110 by 10:

\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest investment, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P + (P \times r \times t) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. This can be expressed as a rate of \( \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \) or 75% per year.
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now, let's calculate the interest:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
\[ I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ I = 675 \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 675 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[
\boxed{975}

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since we are cleaning one-half of the 90 rooms:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, let's start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required for his class. 

Each of the 27 students needs 2 glue sticks:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to determine how many packs are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks:

"To solve this, let's start by calculating the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, so:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

Let's denote:
- The number of books Anne has as \( A \).
- The number of books Sofie has as \( S \).
- The number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of one bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost of one bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

3. **Cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles of water * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total cost:**
   - $9.00 (soda) + $4.00 (water) = $13.00.

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm.
   - He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
   - Number of chickens to sell = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken is sold for $50.
   - Total revenue = 180 chickens \(\times\) $50 per chicken = $9000.

3. **Calculate the cost of the chickens:**
   - Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
   - Total revenue = Cost of chickens + Profit.
   - Therefore, Cost of chickens = Total revenue - Profit = $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many glasses of lemonade each of the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold. Julie sold 14 glasses, and together they sold 32 glasses. 

First, we calculate the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between them:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, each of the boys sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of the items Kelly has in her cart:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Since she has 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, as they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the information:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Next, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring cups as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, we need to subtract these 6 spoons from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360

"To find the total number of states in both India and the USA, we start by noting that the USA has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

First, we calculate half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, we add the number of states in both countries:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"To figure out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to determine how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
   \]
3. The total number of cherries is 60. We know Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries. So, the number of cherries Jerry has is:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, let's break down the sales and calculate the earnings step by step.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

Thus, Sunny earned a total of:

"Hi there! I'm Aparna, and I'm here to help you with the problem about Adrianne's beads.

Adrianne received beads from three different people:
- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we need to find out how many servings 21 pounds of crawfish make:
\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
\]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. To find the number of football players, we calculate 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find this number, we calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"Sure, let's calculate how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the remaining soil.

First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is:

"To find out how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month for shoes. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

This means Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. Over the course of a year, she will save:
$500.00 * 12 months = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find out how long it will take me to peel and cook 90 shrimp, I need to break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - I can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, I will need:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - I can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To cook 90 shrimp, I will need to do 3 batches (since 90 divided by 30 is 3).
   - Each batch takes 10 minutes, so the total cooking time is:
     \[
     3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Adding the peeling time and the cooking time together:
     \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Howl Duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the Combined Howl Duration to Minutes:**

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6, with 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids. So, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is \( 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30\).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Number of babies born each month = \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = \(120 \times 12 = 1440\).

4. **Determine the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = \(50 + 1440 = 1490\).

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * 10,000 = $2,000.

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   - Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25.

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - Total earnings per week = $25 * 40 = $1,000.

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   - Number of weeks = Down payment / Total earnings per week = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Hi there! I'm Aparna, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. Here are the prices of the fruits:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:
- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total spent: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
- Remaining amount: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
- Number of plums: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]

"To figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:
   \[
   150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
   \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To determine how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate Melissa's total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate Melissa's total expenses.
4. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the hourly rate after expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
- Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
- Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate Melissa's total earnings:
- Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
- Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate Melissa's total expenses:
- Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
- Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

Next, we find the net earnings by subtracting the total expenses from the total earnings:
- Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
- Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we calculate the hourly rate after expenses:
- Hourly rate = Net earnings / Total hours
- Hourly rate = $36 / 18 hours = $2

Therefore, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - He needs to move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Since Richard starts at the first bottle and drops the candy immediately, the time to drop the candy in the first bottle is included in the initial position.
   - Therefore, the total time is just the time to move between the bottles.

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

35 seconds"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add these distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \(180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\)

- Liam is currently 16 years old.
- Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
- At that time, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age.

Let's denote Vince’s age two years ago as \( V \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)
   - \( S = 9 \)

4. **Number of eggs Camden painted:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to group them into sets of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- So, \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- This means it takes \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes to make \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
- If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \( x \) potatoes make 18 scoops.
- The proportion is \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
- Total eggs for the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

For the next 30 days:
- Chester increases his intake to 5 eggs per day.
- Total eggs for the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

   - Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles required for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To find out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the costs into two periods: before and after the price increase.

1. **Before the Price Increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **After the Price Increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total Cost for All Visits:**
   - Total cost for 5 years before the price increase = $30.
   - Total cost for 3 years after the price increase = $45.
   - Total cost for all visits = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of students:**
   - There are 10 students in each grade.
   - There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).

   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can have 8 students.
   - We need to divide the total number of students by the group size.

   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. **Determine the total time required:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room.
   - Multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes.

   \[
   5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let:
- \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) be the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the distance Phineas Frog travels on land and the distance he travels in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
3. **Distance in Water**: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"Hi there! I'm Aparna, and I'm here to help you with your question about John's speed talking.

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his original speed. 

First, let's calculate his new speaking speed:
\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words:
\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
