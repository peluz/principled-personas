"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment Josh made, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total investment.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, then she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining how many jewels Aaron has. According to the information, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance for the gold javelin triples. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. With the gemstone, her throwing distance becomes:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from her enhanced throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amounts of potato salad for adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When cooked, the volume of the tomatoes is halved.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
   - To find out how many cans were used, divide the initial volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box, considering the wall thickness, and then calculate the volume. 

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90
  \]

Thus, Sasha's profit is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \).
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 40000 + 16000 \).
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 56000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \).
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 30769.23 + 12307.69 \).
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 43076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary for both Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56000 + 43076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99076.92 \).

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B \), which can be written as \( 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Finally, find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to consider the following:

1. John has 10 hectares of land.
2. Each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
3. John can harvest every 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year.

First, calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pineapples for all 10 hectares:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in their travel times is:
- Difference in time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry.
6. Five fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( x \).

After Dave ate 14 fries:
\[ x - 14 \]

After the seagull ate 7 fries:
\[ x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \]

After the three pigeons ate 9 fries:
\[ x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \]

The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
\[ \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30 \]
\[ \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \]
\[ \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \]

After the ants carried off one fry:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \]

We know that 5 fries were left:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries Dave bought is \( 48 \).

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the total length of the croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for both peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per gallon:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost of sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

3. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total revenue is \( 10G \).
   - The total cost is \( 5G \).
   - The profit is given as $25.
   - The profit equation is: \( 10G - 5G = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = 5 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   - \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. This results in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 * 40 grams = 1000 grams.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 * 20 grams = 1600 grams.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the costs and her earnings step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Items:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - 2 pairs of shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Initial Savings:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved.

3. **Additional Amount Needed:**
   - Total cost - Initial savings: $70 - $10 = $60

4. **Earnings from Babysitting:**

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park and then determine the time it takes for Gary to walk that distance at his walking speed.

First, calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the values for \( d \) and \( v \):
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We need to find the number of customers on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[
100 + 150 + x = 500
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
250 + x = 500
\]
\[
x = 500 - 250
\]
\[
x = 250
\]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[
250

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   - Janeth borrowed $2000.
   - She promised to return it with an additional 10%.
   - The additional 10% is calculated as: \( 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \).
   - Therefore, the total amount to be repaid is: \( 2000 + 200 = 2200 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:**
   - Janeth pays $165 each month.
   - Over 12 months, the total amount paid is: \( 165 \times 12 = 1980 \).

3. **Calculate the remaining balance:**
   - The remaining balance is the total amount to be repaid minus the total amount paid.
   - Remaining balance: \( 2200 - 1980 = 220 \).

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Calls with the Boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra Calls to Other People:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total Minutes Used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes Remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time required for each type of hole and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
- Number of small holes: 30
- Total time for small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
- Number of large holes: 15
- Total time for large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total times for both types of holes:
- Total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time in hours: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the total number of people at the beginning of the party:

- Initial number of men: 25
- Initial number of women: 15
- Total number of people: 25 + 15 = 40

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party:

- Number of people who left: 1/4 * 40 = 10

This means the number of people remaining is:

- Total remaining people: 40 - 10 = 30

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women remaining can be calculated as follows:

- Number of women remaining: 30 - 22 = 8

So, the number of women left is 8.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

   \[
   C + H = 60

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan is for 5 months. The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the remaining land represents \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. The equation can be written as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls.
2. This means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.
3. The performance is with just the female members, so initially, 26 girls are set to perform.
4. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, only half of the 26 girls can perform:
   - Number of girls who can perform = 26 / 2 = 13
5. The choir's 3 teachers decide to join the performance, adding to the number of people performing.

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:
- Total people = Number of girls who can perform + Number of teachers
- Total people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount of money David saves is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first calculate the total number of gifts she has to wrap. Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gift bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original daily energy consumption:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. Calculate the new daily energy consumption after reducing the usage time:
   - If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original daily consumption and the new daily consumption:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. Convert the daily energy savings to kilowatt-hours:
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}

"Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: 30% of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationships between the sizes of the lockers:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's position, so the new elevation of the comb is:
   10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"Starting with 50 cats on the rock, four boats each carried away 5 cats. This means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away by the boats. 

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we have 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find this number, we calculate 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.

Finally, subtracting the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left, we have 30 - 18 = 12 cats remaining on the rock.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds each type of feeder attracts.

Lillian has:
- 3 homemade feeders, each attracting 30 birds (20 birds + 10 more birds than store-bought feeders).
- 3 store-bought feeders, each attracting 20 birds.

First, calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Now, add the two totals together to get the total number of birds:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   - The money from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total money from selling the cards is $150.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \).
   - \( \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \).
   - \( C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( C = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of gas in each container.
2. Calculate the amount of gas needed for 1/4 of a container.
3. Convert the amount of gas from gallons to pints.

First, we divide the total gallons of gas by the number of containers:
\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we find out how many gallons 1/4 of a container is:
\[ \text{Gallons for 1/4 of a container} = \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we convert the gallons to pints (1 gallon = 8 pints):
\[ \text{Pints} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket:**
   - Movie super ticket: $20
   - One popcorn and one soda for $1 extra: $1

   Total cost with the super ticket: \( 20 + 1 = 21 \)

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Soda: $3
   - Popcorn: \( P \) (we need to find this)

   Total cost without the super ticket: \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

   Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket:
   \[
   15 + P = 21 - 2
   \]
   \[
   15 + P = 19
   \]
   \[
   P = 19 - 15
   \]
   \[
   P = 4

The regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding the original cost of filling one helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon went up by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
     \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

Let's start with the volume of one raised bed:
- Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
- Volume of one raised bed = 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Next, calculate the total volume of soil needed for 10 raised beds:
- Total volume = 10 beds × 32 cubic feet/bed = 320 cubic feet.

Now, determine the number of bags of potting soil required:
- Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
- Number of bags needed = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.

Finally, calculate the total cost:
- Each bag costs $12.
- Total cost = 160 bags × $12 per bag = $1920.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the total weight of each type of feed and then calculate the total weight. Finally, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the weights to find the total weight of all the feed:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ pounds (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ pounds (hay)} + 1300 \text{ pounds (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips required:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - The total weight of the feed is 4500 pounds.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this, we first need to convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to account for the overlaps in allergies. 

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Total: 9 + 6 = 15

However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they have been counted twice. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
- Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total kids in the class: 32
- Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many songs Luri has on his media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of songs they can each add:
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oats Consumption per Horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, each horse eats 5 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. **Daily Oats Consumption for All Horses:**
   - Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
   - Total daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Total Oats Consumption for Five Days:**
   - Over 5 days, the total consumption = 40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. **Number of 50-Pound Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Number of bags needed = 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per individual razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

5. **Converting the Cost to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the order they are stacked. 

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl)**: The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \), Lily found as \( L \), and Bodhi found as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

Now, let's sum up the total picking rate for all four individuals:

- Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
- Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
- Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Heather has a total of 27 cups of raisins.
2. She divides these raisins equally among three uses: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. This means each use gets:
   \[
   \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom bought a CD for $4.
2. The total amount Tom spent was $48.
3. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44
   \]

4. Now, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To meet his monthly saving target of $1125 in April, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month compared to the first half. Let's break down the calculation:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
3. Therefore, the total savings in the first half is \( 15x \).
4. In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so the amount saved each day is \( 2x \).
5. The total savings in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
6. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]
7. We know the total savings should be $1125, so:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
9. The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. 

First, we know there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. The rest of the buttons, which is \(21 - 7 = 14\) buttons, have 4 holes each.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 4 holes:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the two totals together to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we find the average weight by dividing the total weight by the number of friends:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information given and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
- The difference is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to so that it reaches 520 degrees, considering the 4% error:
- Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to.
- The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).
- We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
  \[
  1.04x = 520
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500

"To solve this, we need to track the height of the beanstalk each day until it surpasses 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets from mushrooms per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

Next, to find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy, let's first convert all his coins into cents and then see how many 5-cent gumballs he can purchase.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives us the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to determine the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two periods and calculate the earnings for each period separately.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total number of washes the bottle can provide. The bottle is designed to give 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Thus, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items with the discount applied.

1. Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount:
   - Shirt: $25
   - Shorts: $35
   - Total cost before discount: $25 + $35 = $60

2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost:
   - Discount amount: 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18
   - Total cost after discount: $60 - $18 = $42

3. Subtract the total cost after discount from Joe's initial amount of money:
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Money left after purchase: $50 - $42 = $8

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to do a few calculations:

1. First, convert the height requirement from feet to inches. The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet, and since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the requirement is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many more inches he needs to grow to meet the requirement, we subtract his current height from the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To determine how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to calculate the total sales, the cost to acquire the cars, the profit, and finally, James's commission.

1. **Total Sales:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James's commission is 10% of the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, James made $17,500.

$17,500"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of riders**: 100
2. **Percentage of riders who can stay upright**: 25%

First, calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of a Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of a Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

The total price for all three jewels is \(4800\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we add up all the stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45
\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To solve this, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour. This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week.

First, let's calculate the number of customers Jewel processes in a week. Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how far Reggie ran:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine how far Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, \( 20 = L + 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L + 3 = 20 \)
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( L = 20 - 3 \)
   - \( L = 17 \)

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.

1. **Calculate the volume:**
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the time to shovel the earth:**
   - Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth.
   - Total time = volume \(\times\) time per cubic foot
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds}

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly hanger rental is $5,000.
3. The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
2. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 
   - 20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.
3. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and buys a week's worth, which is 7 days.
   - The total cost for the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.
4. He also buys a donut for $2.
   - The total cost for everything is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. If Janey has 21 books and this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can represent the number of books Sally has as \( S \). The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

First, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own, which means:
   - 3 children × 3 grandchildren per child = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children of their own, which means:
   - 9 grandchildren × 3 great grand-babies per grandchild = 27 great grand-babies.

So, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

"Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She allocates 50% of her paycheck to her retirement account, which amounts to:
\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

She also uses 20% of her paycheck for her monthly car payment, which is:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

To find out how much money she has left after these expenses, we subtract the amounts for her retirement and car payment from her total paycheck:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the fireworks from two sources: the city's display and the ones she sets off herself.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks from the city's display:
- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks, with each box containing 20 fireworks.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks from her house:
- Fireworks visible to Hannah = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah has 3 boxes of fireworks, with each box containing 5 fireworks.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the fireworks she sets off herself:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve the problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches gives us the total length of Topher's shoe:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Convert to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Calculate the votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Calculate the votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This means she trades:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This means she trades:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Adding up all the buttons she has by the end:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Large buttons: 20

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, the 20 large buttons are equivalent to:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first calculate the total revenue from the eggplants. Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

This means Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from the corn, we subtract the revenue from the eggplants from his total goal:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find the price per ear of corn, we divide the total needed revenue by the number of ears of corn:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the trip into the driving and hiking portions and calculate the distance for each.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob has 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. Bob buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third grade: 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate. The fourth grade's pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40, so the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80. Therefore, 0.80 * 400 = 320 fifth graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

"To solve this, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed on average each day. First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, we find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce salt scrub.
- The amount of citrus zest (\(Z\)) is equal to the amount of fragrance (\(F\)).
- The amount of salt (\(S\)) is equal to the amount of sugar (\(G\)).
- The amount of oil (\(O\)) is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \(Z\). Therefore, the amount of fragrance is also \(Z\).

Since the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, the amount of salt is \(2Z\). The amount of sugar is also \(2Z\).

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \(2 \times 2Z = 4Z\).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10 \]
\[ 10Z = 10 \]
\[ Z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \(4Z = 4 \times 1 = 4\) ounces.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we start by determining how much Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:

\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each character can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then add them together.

1. For the first part of the journey, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the journey, after taking some rest, Mason travels at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Adding the distances from both parts of the journey gives us the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

Now, we add up the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in, the contributions from her part-time job and her mom, and the additional amount she still needs.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To solve this, let's break it down:

- A large apple yields 5 slices.
- A small apple yields 3 slices.
- Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

First, calculate the total slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, calculate the total slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, add the slices from both types of apples:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down:

1. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so the current daily milk production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows required is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

"To figure out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to add the cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The cost of the car is $10000, and the cost of the phone is $800. So, the total cost is:
\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, which totals:
\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, I'll start by calculating the total time available for performances, excluding the intermission. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have:

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling:

2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform in the 110 minutes, I divide the total available time by the time each group needs:

110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/group = 11 groups.

Therefore, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

Now, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
23

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of Kelly's grocery items:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs at a total cost of $10, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   Since she has 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the length of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes.
2. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the concert duration without the encore is \( 2x \).
3. The encore adds 15 minutes to the final concert, making the total duration \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.
4. We know the total duration of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
5. Subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 50

6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and this payment covers all the lawns she mowed, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, let's break down the problem:

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl for dinner. This means 2 adult bowls will be used.
3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls.
4. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls
5. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to break down the requirements for each type of mask and then sum them up.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to account for the time he spends on various activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Calculate his earnings per hour.
3. Compute his total earnings for an eight-hour workday.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour:
- Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
- This means he completes \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) packages per hour.

Next, we calculate his hourly earnings:
- Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
- Therefore, his hourly earnings are \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \) dollars per hour.

Finally, we compute his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:
- He works 8 hours a day.
- His total earnings are \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

So, Colby earns 64 dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To figure out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total distance Jon drives in a 30-day month. 

Jon drives 100 miles each day, so over 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for tune-ups:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For each additional hour beyond the initial 12 hours, the charge is 70 pesos.

First, we calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Adding this to the initial 12-hour rate:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, let's break down the requirements for the goats and the sheep.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15, so the total cost before any discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on the total cost:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Subtracting this from the original total cost gives:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then sells 5 of the CDs for $40. This means he recovers $40 from the sale.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the amount he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming initially.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal = \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Points**: The team scored a total of 45 points.
2. **Bahati's Points**: Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati,
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo,
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( B = D + 10 \)
- \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( A = B - 20 \)
- \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
- \( A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \)
- \( D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \)

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40

   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To figure out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these up:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
   \]
3. The total number of cherries is 60. Since Robert and Richard together have:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ cherries}
   \]
   Jerry must have:
   \[
   60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To solve this, let's break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Total warming: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) flights in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the howl durations for each wolf:

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. There are 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies:
   \[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

2. The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:
   \[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

3. Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
   \[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve the problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. Here are the prices:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:
- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total spent: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
- Remaining amount: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
- Number of plums: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know:
- \( S = 4 \) dollars
- \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily mining rate for 40 dwarves:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total monthly mining rate:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then in 30 days, they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he might not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can distribute to their friends and family. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats allocated for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give.

Let's start with the total number of seats available for friends and family:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]
\[ \text{Seats for graduates} = 950 \]
\[ \text{Seats for faculty} = 300 \]
\[ \text{Seats for friends and family} = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Next, we divide the number of seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Total food consumed per day = 360 grams/day.
   - Number of days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the height of the first child is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total weight of the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine the amount of paint required and its cost.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Total remaining sodas: 8
   - Shaken sodas left: 2
   - Unshaken sodas left: 6

   The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add these distances together to find the total distance apart.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \(180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\)

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = People helped per day * Number of days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

Thus, the total number of people Billy helps is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. So, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug, which is 33 degrees.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.

3. **Set up the proportion to find the number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \( x \) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - Proportion: \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Cross-multiply: \( 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \).

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three:

\[
27 \text{ (Jim)} + 22 \text{ (Carlos)} + 11 \text{ (Carrey)} = 60 \text{ seashells}
\]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves:

\[
60 \text{ seashells} / 3 = 20 \text{ seashells per person}
\]

Each person got 20 seashells.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine the current production capacity of Hortex.
3. Find the difference between the required number of bottles and the current production.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles required

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the current production capacity

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

### Step 3: Find the difference

The additional number of bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:

1. First, determine the cost of one book. Since 100 books cost $500, the cost per book is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Finally, since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, the number of books per school is:
   \[
   \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
   \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's go through the sequence of events step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event.
- 5 apples from the second event.
- 6 apples from the third event.

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made - Snowballs melted
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs

4. **Time to Make 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of production.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost per visit is $2.
   - For the first 5 years, the total cost is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \text{ visits/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} \times 5 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Price Increase:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is:
     \[
     1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The new cost per visit is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

"To solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time taken for each side:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the times:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the land part and the water part.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 100 yards (half of 200 yards)
3. **Distance in Water**: 100 yards (half of 200 yards)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**:
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**:
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
