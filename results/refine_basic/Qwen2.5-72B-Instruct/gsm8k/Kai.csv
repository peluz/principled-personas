"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment, which includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs, given the increase in value.
3. Subtract the total investment from the new value to find the profit.

**Step 1: Total Investment**
- Purchase price: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: New Value of the House**
- The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original value.
- Original value: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- New value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

**Step 3: Calculate the Profit**
- New value: $200,000
- Total investment: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house.

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is determined by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days of the year.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food, so we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag to find the number of bags needed:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amounts of potato salad for adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( d \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can set up the equation:
\[ 300 = 50d \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \):

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To figure out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she originally bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90
  \]

So, Sasha's profit is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water and the total amount of both combined.

1. **Identify the ratio and total amount:**
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the common factor for the ratio.
   - Therefore, the amount of sugar used is \( 7x \) teaspoons.
   - The amount of water used is \( 13x \) cups.
   - The total amount is the sum of the sugar and water: \( 7x + 13x = 20x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

"To solve this, let's start by determining Lylah's salary four years ago. Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's and Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%), we calculate her new salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

99076.92"

"Sure, let's calculate how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.

1. First, determine the total number of pineapples John has in his field:
   - John has 10 hectares of land.
   - Each hectare has 100 pineapples.
   - Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

2. Next, determine how many times John can harvest his field in a year:
   - John can harvest every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Number of harvests per year = 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests.

3. Finally, calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
   - Total pineapples per harvest = 1000 pineapples.
   - Number of harvests per year = 4.
   - Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the travel times for both Steve and Tim.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting:

"To figure out how much Shawnda made, let's break down the costs based on the number of tires inflated:

- Bicycles have 2 tires. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is:
\[20 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

"Let's solve this step by step, starting with the information given:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry.
6. Five fries were left.

Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( x \).

1. After Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. After the seagull ate 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. After the three pigeons ate 9 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. After the ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

\[
x = 48

"To figure out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, we calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
- Total hours per week = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
- Total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to feet and then sum them up.

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To figure out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, let's break down the distances each person covers.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there + 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there + 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Rate:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the price multiplier for each two-month period is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752

   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

3. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total revenue is \( 10G \).
   - The total cost is \( 5G \).
   - The profit is given as $25.
   - The profit equation is: \( 10G - 5G = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( G = 5 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.

"To solve this, let's break down Zaid's monthly expenses and donations step by step:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount After Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Expenses for Daughter and Wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total Given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final Amount Left:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will have 350 dollars left.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
2. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

First, let's find the number of white carnations:
- If 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations, then the number of white carnations is \( \frac{200}{5} = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the number of red roses:
- Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   - \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: calculating the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and calculating the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine How Much More Likely It Is to Roll a Number Greater Than 3
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages * \( r \) rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 18r pieces.
   - We know that 18r = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the costs and her earnings step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Items:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - 2 pairs of shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Sara's Initial Savings:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved.

3. **Additional Amount Needed:**
   - Total cost - Initial savings: $70 - $10 = $60

4. **Earnings from Babysitting:**
   - Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting: 4 * $5 = $20

5. **Total Amount After Babysitting:**
   - Initial savings + Babysitting earnings: $10 + $20 = $30

6. **Remaining Amount Needed:**
   - Total cost - Total amount after babysitting: $70 - $30 = $40

7. **Earnings from Mowing the Lawn:**
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
   - Number of times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, which is:
   \[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We need to find the number of customers on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of these items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori has to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay back an additional 10% of the amount.
2. The additional 10% of $2000 is calculated as:
   \[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]
3. Therefore, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
   \[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]
4. Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over this period is:
   \[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]
5. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:
   \[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. We have two aquariums:
   - Aquarium 1 has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium 2 has 32 snails.

2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
   \[
   32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

4. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2f
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   28 = 4f

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours each day to apply the makeup.
3. The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, calculate the total number of hours of makeup application:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total cost without the discount:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount:
\[ 30,000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30,000 \text{ dollars} - 3,000 \text{ dollars} = 27,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:
\[ 27,000 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's start by figuring out the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, a mamba must have:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the total number of stars and the rows:

- There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
  \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

- There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
  \[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

- Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
  \[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

- The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
  \[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

- Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
2. There are 5 members in the household, so the total rice consumption per meal is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]
3. The household eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), so the daily consumption is:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]
4. To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]
5. Finally, to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
2. They need twice as many plant pots for the roses, which means:
   \[
   30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses}
   \]
3. The total number of plant pots needed is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots}
   \]
4. April had already bought 100 plant pots. So, the number of plant pots she has left over is:
   \[
   100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots}
   \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to start with the total amount of money she had initially and subtract the amount she spent and gave away.

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

First, we calculate the total amount spent and given away:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time spent boating:** 6 hours
2. **Time spent swimming:** Half of the boating time, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Time spent watching shows:** 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Adding these times together gives the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

3. From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:
   \[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts to her current savings:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then divide the total amount (principal + interest) by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan is for 5 months. The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50

"To figure out how much money David saves, we need to compare the total cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount of money David saves is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"To figure out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives us:

6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gift bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet.
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's elevation, so the comb landed at:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.
4. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made a total of $150 from selling his Pokemon cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

We know this amount is $150:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

- The 5 utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - The total distance traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

The equation for the number of cookies Matt can have is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors Without Discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - The total cost after the buy one get one free offer is $4.00.

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls)**: Each of these girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[

"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \), Lily found as \( L \), and Bodhi found as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To hit his monthly saving target of $1125 in April, Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month compared to the first half. Let's break down the problem:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
3. In the first half, he saves \( 15x \) in total.
4. In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) each day, so he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) in total.
5. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]
6. We know the total savings should be $1125:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
8. Therefore, the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half is:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Mark's Weight**: Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. **Susan's Weight**: Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. **Bob's Weight**: Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the average weight of the three friends is:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this, we need to figure out the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's determine the percentage error:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees but reaches 468 degrees.
- The difference is \(468 - 450 = 18\) degrees.
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to so that it reaches 520 degrees, considering the 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets from mushrooms per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams.

Next, to find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and his earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount George needs to pay:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy, let's first convert all his coins into cents and then see how many 5-cent gumballs he can purchase.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent = 15 cents

Adding these up gives us the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy:
345 ÷ 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to determine the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To figure out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the tires rotate \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, the total number of rotations per month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of rotations per year is \( 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \) rotations.

4. **Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.
   - The number of years before replacement is \( \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \) years.

"To figure out the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to start by understanding the total number of washes she can get from the bottle. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   - I sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **Commission:**
   - My commission is 10% of the profit.
   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, I made $17,500 from selling the used cars.

$17,500"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of riders**: 100
2. **Percentage of riders who can stay upright**: 25%

First, calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of a Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of a Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of a Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of a Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the difference in their speeds and the initial distance between them. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. The initial distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. Here's what he bought:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding those up: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Total days recorded: 30 days.
- Good days: 12 days.
- Bad days: 8 days.
- Neutral days: \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of the first 24 days is:
- First 8 days: All good.
- Next 8 days: All bad.
- Next 8 days: All neutral.

This leaves us with the last 6 days of the month. According to the problem, the next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Now, let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- 2 good days.

Adding the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.
- Total good days: \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

where \( J \) is the number of books Janey has, and \( S \) is the number of books Sally has. We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( S \). First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Alright, let's break this down step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for 12 dogs.
3. After buying these 8 toys, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left. This means there are 24 dogs in total.
4. He needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.
5. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs.
6. He already has 20 toys (4 initial + 8 first purchase + 8 second purchase), so he needs to buy 1 more toy to have enough for 21 dogs.

Total toys needed: 4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 1 (final purchase) = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then determine how much this exceeds the elevator's maximum load.

1. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
2. There are 9 people in total (Jack + 8 other adults).
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out how much the total weight exceeds this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

3. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

4. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, which amounts to:
\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment, which is:
\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

To find out how much money she has left to spend, we subtract the amounts for her retirement and car payment from her total paycheck:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. This means:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday, leaving 3000 people who had not voted yet. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Thus, 2000 more people voted by 16:00, leaving:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house be \( x \).
2. The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases. Substituting \( x = 50 \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to break down the trip into the driving and hiking portions and calculate the distance for each.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}\).

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob buys
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob buys

From the problem, we know:
1. \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
2. After adding these fish, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish.

So, the equations we have are:
1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Sure, let's break it down:

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. That's 14 days, so:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days, so:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding these together, the total hours played so far is:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

"To figure out how much money Jack and his friends used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):**
   - Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
   - One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce salt scrub.
- The amount of citrus zest (\(Z\)) is equal to the amount of fragrance (\(F\)).
- The amount of salt (\(S\)) is equal to the amount of sugar (\(G\)).
- The amount of oil (\(O\)) is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \(Z\). Therefore:
- \(F = Z\)
- \(S = 2Z\)
- \(G = 2Z\)
- \(O = 2S = 2(2Z) = 4Z\)

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so:
\[ Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10 \]
\[ 10Z = 10 \]
\[ Z = 1 \]

Now, substituting \(Z = 1\) into the equation for oil:
\[ O = 4Z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate how much more Roy has saved compared to Anthony. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
   \[
   0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings:
   \[
   30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:
\[
\boxed{42}

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then add them together.

1. For the first part of the journey, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the journey, after taking some rest, Mason travels at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Adding the distances from both parts of the journey gives us the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance \( D \) they cover.
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same for all kangaroos, so the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To figure out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information:

- The laptop costs $600.
- Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika has $150 from her part-time job.
- Her mom gives her $80.
- She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, let's start by calculating the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- Large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices
- Small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{16}

1. Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which means he has:
   \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. He buys six squirt guns, each costing $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

3. He also buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
   \[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

4. The total amount spent on both the squirt guns and the water balloons is:
   \[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

5. To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

"To figure out how many groups can perform at the concert, I'll start by calculating the total time available for performances, excluding the intermission. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have:

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling:

2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes per group.

Now, to find out how many groups can perform in the 110 minutes, I divide the total available time by the time each group needs:

110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/group = 11 groups.

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest on her investment and then add it to the original amount.

1. **Principal (P):** $300
2. **Interest Rate (r):** Three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year.
3. **Time (t):** 3 years

The formula for simple interest is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break down the costs of Kelly's grocery items:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs at $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet} \]
   With 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]
   With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. She mowed Joe's lawn a certain number of times, and Joe paid her $6 in total.
3. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
4. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

- The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

The total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

Since Joe paid her $6 in total, and this is the total payment for all the lawns she mowed, we can assume that the $6 is the total payment for all 9 times she mowed lawns. Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, we can calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} + \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} \]
\[ 80 = 6 + \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6 = 74 \]

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down:

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- This means each small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, Jo will need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- This means each large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, Jo will need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Sure, let's break it down:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is the sum of the pieces thrown at the red and yellow balloons:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:

"To solve this, let's break down the expenses:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, let's add this to the initial 12-hour cost:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours, we subtract the total cost of his stay from the 24-hour stay cost:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."

"Sure, let's break it down:

James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15. So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on the total cost:
\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the discount amount is $60. Subtract this from the original total cost to find the amount James paid:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then sells 5 of the CDs for $40. This means he recovers $40 from the 5 CDs he no longer wants.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the amount he paid:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players.
2. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find the number of players on Zeke's team:
   \[
   13 + 7 = 20
   \]
3. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:
   \[
   13 + 20 = 33
   \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy.
   - \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights go to Greece, so \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights go to Greece.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the remaining flights are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), and each destination (France and Germany) gets half of this, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up an equation. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total costs and then determine the earnings. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: 4

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- Cost to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week: $120
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and the costs are the expenses, the expected earnings would be the negative of the total cost (assuming no revenue is generated from the students).

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30\).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Number of babies born each month = \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = \(120 \times 12 = 1440\).

4. **Determine the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = \(50 + 1440 = 1490\).

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the down payment amount:**
   - The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

2. **Determine Janet's total earnings per hour:**
   - Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   - Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25

3. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - Total earnings per week = $25 * 40 = $1,000

4. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**
   - Number of weeks = Down payment / Total earnings per week = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. Here are the prices:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:
- Cost of peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Cost of pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Cost of kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Cost of apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total spent: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
- Remaining money: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
- Number of plums: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the prices:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of animals sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x = 12x \).
   - The total earnings from all sales is \( 8x + 12x = 20x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know the total earnings are $120, so:
     \[
     20x = 120
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{20} = 6

   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher gives a personal extension: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, let's break it down step by step:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
   \[
   150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
   \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"Sure, let's calculate the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater.

First, we need to determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class
- 13 family members

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we account for the 4 people who said they could not come:
Total guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater has a base fee for 20 guests, which is $125. For each additional guest beyond the initial 20, there is an additional fee of $6.

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total weight of the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Total remaining sodas: 8
   - Shaken sodas left: 2
   - Unshaken sodas left: 6

   The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"To solve this, let's break it down:

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train travels \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).
- The second train travels \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\).

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
- Total distance apart: \(180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\).

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00

"To figure out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate how much Jane has already saved:
- Jane saves $4 every week.
- She has been saving for 8 weeks.
- So, the total amount saved so far is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) dollars.

Next, determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
- The total amount she wants to save is $60.
- She has already saved $32.
- Therefore, the remaining amount she needs to save is \( 60 - 32 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining $28:
- Jane saves $4 each week.
- To find out how many more weeks she needs, divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings: \( 28 \div 4 = 7 \) weeks.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to consider both the fixed cost of the color and the variable cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut off is:
   \[
   10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The cost of the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. **First 16 minutes:**
   - Cost per minute: $0.25
   - Total cost for 16 minutes: \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \) dollars

2. **Remaining 20 minutes:**
   - Cost per minute: $0.20
   - Total cost for 20 minutes: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \) dollars

3. **Total cost for the 36-minute call:**
   - Sum of the costs for both parts: \( 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \) dollars

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is \( 8.00 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let:
- \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has,
- \( S \) be the number of paintings Shelley has,
- \( M \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:

3. Compute the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Total doughnuts made each day**
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

**Step 2: Total doughnuts made in June**
June has 30 days, so:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 3: Total revenue from selling all the doughnuts**
Each doughnut sells for $2, so:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
\[ 7200 \]"

"Sure, let's break it down:

1. John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
2. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
   \[
   150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
   \]
3. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, so the total number of words is:
   \[
   10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words}
   \]
4. To find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To figure out how many lemons Tim will need, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Lemons for the Pool Party:**
   - Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's Extra Gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% off: $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount. The original price of the shoes is $40.

- The discount is 40%, so Jake pays 60% of the original price: $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distances run by Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
