"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the new value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original value ($80,000) is calculated as: 
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[
\boxed{70000}

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement:
- Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the sheep from each city:
   - Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial partial download, the Windows restart, and the full re-download.

1. **Initial Partial Download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - At a download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Full Re-download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down John's journey into segments and calculate the distances for each segment.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next 0.5 hours, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled Back Home:**
   - Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Final Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled back home = 135 miles.
   - Final distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Sales at the Green House:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Sales at the Red House:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners left after the red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Sales at the Orange House:**
   Melanie sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Final Condition:**
   We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solving the Equation:**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire makes a 3-egg omelet each morning.
2. **Total Days in 4 Weeks**: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.
3. **Total Eggs in 4 Weeks**: Multiply the daily consumption by the total number of days: \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).
4. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: \(84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 7 \text{ dozens}\).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining part of her hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking:
- 1 hour for the first 4 miles
- 1 hour for the next 2 miles

So, the total time she has already spent is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to complete the remaining distance.

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

     \]

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - The remaining amount of orange drink is:
     \[
     10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Determine the total amount of water in the final mixture:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is:
     \[
     9 \text{ liters (remaining orange drink)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple drink)} = 24 \text{ liters}

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the information provided:

- Henry's total trip is 60 miles.
- He made his first stop after 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, we calculate the position of the second stop:
- Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, it is located at:
  \[
  60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, we find the distance between the first stop and the second stop:
- The first stop is at 20 miles, and the second stop is at 45 miles. Therefore, the distance between these two stops is:
  \[
  45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots in dollars.

The cost of the first pair of high heels is given as $33.

The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \] dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and their total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Next, we solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:

- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the individual guesses and then find their mean.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[
23

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we add the points from both periods to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total expenditure for the 30-day period.

**Step 1: Total Number of Yoghurts Consumed**
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts he consumes is:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Cost Per Yogurt**
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

**Step 3: Total Expenditure**
To find the total amount Terry spends on 60 yogurts, we multiply the number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ 75.00 \]"
"John initially possesses 13 lego sets, each of which he sells for $15. Therefore, the total amount he earns from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then uses this money to buy 8 video games, each costing $20. The total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After purchasing the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount spent on the video games and the remaining money is:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John used all the money from selling his lego sets and has $5 left, he has already sold all his lego sets. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

"To determine John's average running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running each week.

John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time spent running per week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we use the total distance and total time to find the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18 miles"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire 300g bag of chips. The nutritional information states that there are 250 calories per serving, and the bag contains 5 servings:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, so we can calculate the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 × Number of blue ties
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie.
   - Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
   \[
   \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties × Cost per red tie
   \[
   \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties

"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[ \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} = 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[ \text{Occupied units} = \text{Total units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \]

Finally, we can determine the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to estimate the distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
- Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Distance traveled / Gallons used
- Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Next, we use the car's fuel efficiency to find the total distance she can travel on a full tank:
- The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
- Total distance = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
- Total distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate David's laundry as follows:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate Raymond's laundry as follows:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and using the information provided:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of dogs \( D \) is 60.
- The number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Now, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of tomatoes before and after cooking, and how many tomatoes are in each can.

1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. This means the initial volume of the tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce.

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Volume per Can**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume by the volume per can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and understanding the given information:

- Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
- Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
- 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5.

Since the total number of cars initially is 30, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Summing these times:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Given that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate both the total cost of the lumber she initially bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:

  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars per board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars per board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps to determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%) as Adrien's:
   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 + 12307.69 = 43076.92
   \]

4. **Calculate the total salary four years later:**
   \[
   \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

"To calculate the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to determine both the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Total Revenue from Patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To solve this problem, we start with the total number of seasonal workers, which is 60. A third of these workers quit after an unpleasant incident with children, so we calculate the number of workers who quit as follows:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

This means 20 workers quit, leaving:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining workers quit after another incident. Therefore, the number of workers left is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of elves left is 30.

"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to calculate the total number of rides each of them took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. Therefore, the total number of rides Pam took is:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. Therefore, the total number of rides Fred took is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Adding the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred gives:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Thus, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the miles walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles.
   - Miles walked on Tuesday = 24 miles.
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the miles walked on Wednesday:**
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - To find the miles walked on Wednesday, subtract the total miles from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage:
   - Miles walked on Wednesday = \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

Thus, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

The number of questions Mark completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, let's consider the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

The number of questions Mark completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we start by defining the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, calculate \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

"To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hasn't already returned comes back to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people each had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people each had all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person had their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[
10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step, considering the sequence of events and the quantities involved.

1. **Dave's Initial Consumption:**
   - Dave ate 14 fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack initially.
   - After Dave ate, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 \).

2. **Seagull's Consumption:**
   - The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
   - After the seagull ate, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

3. **Pigeons' Consumption:**
   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
   - Total fries eaten by the pigeons is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
   - After the pigeons ate, the number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

4. **Raccoon's Consumption:**
   - The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - The number of fries the raccoon took is \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \).
   - The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

5. **Ants' Consumption:**
   - The ants carried off one fry.
   - The number of fries left after the ants is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).

6. **Final Number of Fries:**
   - According to the problem, 5 fries were left.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
     \]

7. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Add 1 to both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3:
     \[
     x - 30 = 18
     \]
   - Add 30 to both sides:
     \[
     x = 48
     \]

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 48 \).

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then extend it over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours spent in class in one semester:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total Length:**
   - The total length of all the baked goods is the sum of the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught individually and then sum these amounts.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, we sum the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

- Total fish: \(15 + 9 + 8 = 32\)

Thus, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price:**
   - The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means each increase is a multiplication by 1.20 (since 20% is 0.20, and 1 + 0.20 = 1.20).

3. **Number of Increases:**
   - Over 36 months, the number of two-month periods is 36 / 2 = 18.

4. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Final Price:**
   - Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
     \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Seth and Brooke. Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. Let \( J \) represent Jean's age.
2. Let \( M \) represent Mark's age.
3. Jan's age is given as 30.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark: 
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, the equation is:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5
   \]

Now, let's solve the second equation:
\[
M - 2 = 19
\]
\[
M = 19 + 2
\]
\[
M = 21
\]

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:
\[
J = M + 2
\]
\[
J = 21 + 2
\]
\[
J = 23

- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they complete it in \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete it in \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete it in \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds.
- Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

The difference in their total times is:

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the profit per bag, and then use the total profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Cost per bag**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and incurs a transportation cost of $2 per bag. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30. Therefore, the profit per bag is:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400. To find the number of bags sold, we use the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To determine how much each of the three friends paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by three.

1. **Cost of tickets**: The total cost for 3 tickets is $20.25.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, the cost of food is:
   \[
   20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]
3. **Cost of rides**: Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides. Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   33 \times 2 = 66
   \]

Next, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
\]

Finally, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
\[
102 \div 3 = 34

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert this weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing the total weekly amount by 7 days:

\[ 35 \, \text{pounds/week} \div 7 \, \text{days/week} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual changes**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, including the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:

\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount due to find the remaining balance:

\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be:

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the sum of the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent on puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to complete one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Thus, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games.

"To solve this problem, we start by noting the initial amount of water in the tank, which is 120 liters. Celine uses 90 liters of this water to water her garden. 

The amount of water left in the tank after this usage is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding this collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives us the total amount of water in the tank now:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we start by calculating the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. When Ashlyn visited after two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

This means that the number of watermelons that were not ready at that time is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Last night:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.
     \[
     \text{Cougars killed today} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.
     \[
     \text{Wolves killed today} = 3 \times 12 = 36
     \]

3. **Total animals killed today:**
   \[
   \text{Total animals killed today} = 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48
   \]

4. **Total animals killed over both nights:**
   \[
   \text{Total animals killed} = (10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars}) + (36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars}) = 25 + 48 = 73
   \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each child went down the water slide, starting with the information given about Mitchel.

1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find this, we calculate 30% of 30:
   \[
   30 \times 0.30 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
   \]
3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
   \[
   21 \times 4 = 84
   \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

84"
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial number of cows in the stalls. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of currency and then sum these values.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has, and \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

4. Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[ A_a = 52 \]

First, we can use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we sum up all the fruits to find the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the total number of cookies she plans to bake. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which sums up to:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Given that 2 cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens 66 cookies make:

\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \text{ dozens} \]

Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, the total amount of flour needed for 5.5 dozens is:

\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine how much more the total cost of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total expenses associated with the purchase, including the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

1. **Selling Price**: The selling price of the house is $350,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee**: The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee**: The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget**: Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of cards with the letter A on them. Given that 2/5 of the 80 cards have the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of A cards} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the number of A cards from the total to find the remaining cards:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Of these remaining cards, 1/2 have the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of B cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Subtracting the B cards from the remaining cards, we get:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Of these remaining cards, 5/8 have the letter C. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of C cards} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, the remaining cards have the letter D. We find the number of D cards by subtracting the C cards from the remaining cards:

\[ \text{Number of D cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of cards with the letter D on them is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of hole and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole: 3 minutes
- Number of small holes: 30
- Total time for small holes: \( 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole: 10 minutes
- Number of large holes: 15
- Total time for large holes: \( 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we sum the total times for both types of holes:
- Total time: \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \)

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time in hours: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks, we first need to determine the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week.

In the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled their output:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add the stories from both weeks for each person:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \]

Thus, the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether is 360."
"Given that Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's current age as follows: \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) years old. To find out how old her brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: \( 18 + 3 = 21 \) years old.

"To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop for 55 cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has. 

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

The total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find the number of stars in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, given its speed.

First, we know the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the time as follows:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the question.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total for the adults is:

\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will receive:

\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she spends working, excluding her break, and then calculate her earnings based on her rate of $5 every 10 minutes.

1. **Total Time Worked:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
   - She takes a 30-minute break during this period.
   - Therefore, the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. **Convert Working Time to Minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

3. **Calculate the Number of 10-Minute Intervals:**
   - 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.

4. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 per 10-minute interval.
   - Total earnings = 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Thus, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to account for the fourth round, where each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

Therefore, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

83"
"To solve this problem, we first determine the ages of Will's two sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half the age of the oldest, which makes him 4 years old. 

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will originally bought 15 oranges. Subtracting the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges gives us the number of oranges left unwashed: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

On the second day, he increased his efforts:
- 120 pushups (100 + 20)
- 40 squats (50 - 10)
- 40 dumbbell presses (20 * 2)

Now, let's sum these up:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these totals together gives us the overall count of activities:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

Thus, the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 370."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks.

1. **Calculate daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Each member eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).

   Therefore, the total rice consumption per meal for the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

   Since they eat two meals a day:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The household consumes 2 kg of rice per day.
   - The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg.

   Therefore, the number of days the rice will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is:
   \[
   \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to sum the crates sold over the days he was open and then compare this total to his target of 120 crates.

Here's the breakdown of the sales:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \text{ crates} \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \text{ crates} \]

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To determine the total annual cost John incurs for his driving service, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonus he gives to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so the weekly mileage is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so the annual mileage is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- John gives a $150 bonus each month, so the annual bonus is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the annual bonus to find the total annual cost:
- Total annual cost = $30,000 (mileage) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:
$31,800"
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first add the minutes he exercised on Sunday and Monday. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

The total exercise time for Sunday and Monday is:
23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday, we multiply the total by 2:
39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to meet his goal.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to break down the information provided and perform some calculations.

1. **Total number of books initially**: 250 books.
2. **Number of unsold books**: 50 books.
3. **Books sold over the three years**: 250 - 50 = 200 books.
4. **Books sold in the current year**: 45 books.
5. **Books sold in the first year**: Twice the number of books sold in the current year, so 2 * 45 = 90 books.

Next, we calculate the number of books sold in the second year:
- Total books sold over the three years: 200 books.
- Books sold in the first year: 90 books.
- Books sold in the current year: 45 books.
- Books sold in the second year: 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books.

"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning. Given that the bakery produces 60 loaves each day and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[ \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

According to the problem, half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a series of logical steps:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.
- The total number of players on the team is 105.

We can set up the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has and then determine the total weight of these marbles.

1. Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in his store.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

First, calculate the number of marbles his father gave him:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
\]

Next, add up all the marbles Solomon has:
\[
20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (initially in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles}
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[
78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
156 kg"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in depth. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

"Given the problem, we need to calculate the total number of children in a classroom based on the provided ratios and the number of boys.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to figure out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together gives:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils, given that each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the cream on the strength of Shannon's iced coffee.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to determine the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total monthly salary paid to all the programmers in the company. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than that of a junior programmer.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. 

First, calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, we need:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

First, substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given the problem, we start by noting the weight of the pink frog, which is 50 pounds. From this, we can deduce the weights of the other animals based on the relationships provided:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on vacation. We know the following:

1. John spent 6 hours boating.
2. He spent half that time swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. He watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so the total time spent watching shows is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

Adding these times together gives us the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, these 15 hours represent 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her current savings.

From her first job, she earns:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these earnings to her current savings:
\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the heights of the three trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has based on the information provided about Axel's pesos.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos that Axel and Anna have together.

For silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

For gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:

"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land remaining. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

The equation can be set up as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]
\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of boys and girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and is equally divided between boys and girls, we can calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since the performance is with only the female members, we initially have 26 girls performing. However, on the day of the performance, half of these girls can't make it due to their bus breaking down. Therefore, the number of girls who can attend is:

Number of girls who can attend = 0.5 * 26 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to join the performance. Thus, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can attend + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16."

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his goal, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. Additionally, he walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After these activities, he went for a jog and found that he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can set up the following equation:

Total steps = Steps to and from school + Steps with friend + Steps during jog + Steps left

10,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 + Steps during jog + 2,000

Simplifying the equation:

10,000 = 8,000 + Steps during jog

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

Steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000

Steps during jog = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 4 magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the second package of fireworks, which is twice the cost of the first package.
2. Add the costs of both packages together.
3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages.
4. Add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total.

Let's break it down:

1. The cost of the first package is $400.
2. The cost of the second package is \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of both packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. The discount on the total cost of both packages is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The total cost of both packages after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The cost of the finale firework is $150.
7. The total amount spent is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of 1110 dollars.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make to last her 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she will consume. Shannon eats 2 cookies each night, so over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies (12 cookies) at a time, we need to find out how many dozens are required to make 60 cookies. This is calculated by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we determine the number of candles that are likely to explode. Given that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% (0.01).

\[
\text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the exploding candles have this defect.

\[
\text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount on each blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price of each blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

First, let's calculate the discount on each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we find the discounted price of each blouse by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price.

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses by multiplying the discounted price by the number of blouses.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

For her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels and \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head) is 180:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip through Europe, we can break down the trip into distinct segments and sum the distances for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers.

Now, we sum the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
3140 kilometers."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker based on the sizes of Zack's and Peter's lockers.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the elevation at which Stanley's comb landed and then calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet.
2. The comb falls 4,000 feet from this elevation: 
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, the comb lands at an elevation of 6,000 feet.
3. Oliver's current elevation is 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[
6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital. 

1. The first bank provided $4000.
2. The second bank provided twice the amount of the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
3. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.

Adding these amounts together:

\[ \text{Total Capital} = \text{Initial Capital} + \text{First Bank} + \text{Second Bank} \]
\[ \text{Total Capital} = 5000 + 4000 + 8000 \]
\[ \text{Total Capital} = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial number of cats, which is 50. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting the 20 cats taken away by the boats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 remaining cats, we get the final number of cats left on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per homemade feeder: 20 + 10 = 30 birds

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders: 3
   - Birds attracted per store-bought feeder: 20 birds

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of his cards, meaning he sells 2/3 of his cards. The total amount of money he needs to make from selling the cards is $150, which includes $100 for the amusement park ticket and $50 for spending cash.

Let \( C \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

The revenue from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 \]

We know the revenue must equal $150:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}C \right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Thus, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the number of hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, with enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs and the other half to have one hotdog.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for them.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we start by calculating the weight of each piece. The cake, weighing 20 ounces, is divided into 8 equal pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the total weight of the pieces they have eaten is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} \times 2 \text{ pieces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting this from the original weight of the cake gives us the weight of the remaining cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's drive time from his hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine Wayne's departure time:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).

5. **Calculate the difference in their departure times:**
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

98 feet"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = \(1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60\) beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = \(3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140\) beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = \(140 - 60 = 80\) beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to follow the sequence of events and their effects on the temperature.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**: Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. Therefore, the total temperature increase from baking is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]
3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon:

1. **Swim:**
   - Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
   - James finishes 10% faster:
   \[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Bike:**
   - Jon's bike time: 80 minutes
   - James takes 5 minutes longer:
   \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Run:**
   - Let \( R \) be the time it took James to run.
   - Jon's total time: 170 minutes
   - James' total time: \( 36 + 85 + R \)
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so:
   \[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + R = 180 \]
   \[ R = 180 - 121 \]
   \[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how much change Michael will have after buying the hay for his horse.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail of hay per mile.
   - Total hay needed = 16 miles × \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail per mile = 8 bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24.

4. **Determine the total amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket:**
   - The super ticket costs $20.
   - You get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

2. **Cost Without the Super Ticket:**
   - The movie ticket costs $12.
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Let the regular price of the popcorn be \( P \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + P = 21 - 2
     \]
     \[
     15 + P = 19
     \]
     \[

The regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining the original cost of filling one helium balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon went up by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley went to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. To find the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price, we calculate:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use these to find the average speed.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- The total distance traveled is:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Now, we can find the average speed:
- The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
  \[
  \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
  \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Determine the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
3. Calculate the number of bags of potting soil required.
4. Compute the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.**

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of potting soil required.**

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total cost.**

Each bag costs $12:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To find \( c \), we first isolate the term involving \( c \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Thus, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to a common unit. The shark's length is given in feet, and the remoras' lengths are given in inches. 

1. Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each remora is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras:
   - There are 2 remoras, so the combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
   - The shark's length is 10 feet.
   - The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
   - The percentage is calculated as \( \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \).

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of songs each person has on their media player. Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we calculate how many more songs each person can add to their media player, given that the maximum capacity is 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack but gets 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the costs provided for each venue.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of insects found by each person using variables. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found, \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found, and \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of insects found by all three is 43.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Next, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the couch is 18 feet long."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, let's break down the information provided:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs were strawberry.
- 1 pack was grape, costing $2.
- 1 pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, which is $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We need to find the cost of each strawberry pack, which we'll call \( S \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the savings Janet would achieve by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She does this 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 10 bus trips:
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The total cost for 10 trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

The savings by buying the weekly bus pass is:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by July 19th, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:**
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 19 days

   Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds:**
   - Each pound of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.
   - Total calories to lose 30 pounds = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, which can be expressed as:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Then, we subtract 5 years to find the cousin's age in 8 years:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

Now, we need to determine the cousin's current age. Since the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Finally, we find the age difference between Jame and his cousin by subtracting Jame's current age from the cousin's current age:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of the computer:**
   The computer costs $1,100.

2. **Determine the cost of the printer:**
   The printer costs $400 less than the computer. Therefore, the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:**
   \[
   1100 + 700 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Find the total cost of the 2 monitors:**
   The total amount spent is $2,400. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from this amount to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
   \[
   2400 - 1800 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost of one monitor:**
   Since the total cost of the 2 monitors is $600, the cost of one monitor is:
   \[
   \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back based on the information provided.

1. The boys each brought back 60 seashells.
2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of seashells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books arranged on a shelf, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, which means it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To determine how much more Jairus will earn compared to Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each based on the number of tasks completed and the payment per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. Since he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. Since she also completed 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives \( 4B \).

The total amount of money to be divided is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Thus, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the ages of James's two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, making him 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed:
- The older son needs 12 candles.
- The younger son needs 8 candles.
- Therefore, the total number of candles required is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs are needed:
- We divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(\frac{20}{5} = 4\) packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks, we need to break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert this total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \) pages per minute.
- Therefore, the number of pages she read in the first week is \( 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \) pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \) pages

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( N \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

We know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

1. Distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( N \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 per tooth, which totals to 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, she received half of $1.00 per tooth, which is $0.50 per tooth, totaling 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Adding these amounts together:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark and 45 more than Anna, we can determine the number of goals each of the other two players scored. 

First, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Next, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total:
\[ 80 - 45 = 35 \]
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual scores together:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it with the number of roses Ford can supply each month.

First, let's determine the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Next, we calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per month, assuming there are 4 weeks in a month:
- Total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

Now, let's determine the total number of roses Ford can supply per month:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- Total roses Ford can supply per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

Finally, we find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:
- Roses required per month = 260 roses
- Roses Ford can supply per month = 160 roses
- Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

"To address the issue with Maggie's oven, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting. When Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be:

\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount applied. 

The original price for one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price for one box is:
\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue jelly beans), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue jelly beans).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \). According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

First, we simplify the equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Next, we isolate \( J \) by subtracting \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are twice and three times the smallest angle, which can be expressed as \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we need to determine the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
90 degrees"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide that by the cost of one gumball. Each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).

First, let's convert each type of coin into cents:
- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
- Total = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Now, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
- Number of gumballs = 345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa.

Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can produce in 12 hours. For Ruiz:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total production for both:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the sales into two periods and calculate the earnings for each period separately before summing them up.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- The earnings per hour during this period are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- The earnings per hour during this period are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per mile is:
     \[
     \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
     \[
     400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. Therefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we start by understanding the total volume of shampoo and its cost. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. This means the total number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 \text{ pumps/wash} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.
3. Subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Total cost before discount: \( 25 + 35 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, we apply the 30% discount:
- A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost.
- Discounted total: \( 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the discounted total from Joe's initial amount of money:
- Joe has $50.
- Amount left after purchase: \( 50 - 42 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."
"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need for his croissants, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Butter per dozen croissants**: It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
2. **Butter for 4 dozen croissants**: Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, we multiply the butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]
3. **Butter for a week**: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily butter requirement by 7:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 7 days} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the repaving cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95060 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference in cost:
\[
\text{Difference} = 95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the initial 5 months: $100,000

2. **Extended period:**
   - The total research time is 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months.
   - The additional months beyond the initial 5 months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - The funding per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding.
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of seats in the auditorium. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many of these seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by administrators. We then subtract these seats from the total to find the number of remaining seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats gives us the number of seats occupied by students:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To determine how much James made from selling the used cars, we need to calculate his commission based on the profit from the sales. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the total sales amount:**
   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total acquisition cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James receives a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

2. **Determine the price of the silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is $1600, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price for all three jewels:**
   Now, we sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob, given their respective speeds and the initial distance between them.

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.
   - The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to close the distance:**
   - The initial distance between Tom and Bob is 75 miles.
   - Using the relative speed, we can find the time it takes for Tom to close this distance:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production of customers processed by Julie and Jewel, we need to consider their individual daily processing rates and the number of days they work in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the combined total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the distances each person ran:

- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, which is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
- Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

Let \( L \) represent the distance Lynn ran. According to the problem, Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's distance. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles.

   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. The volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) can be calculated as:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

- **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost**: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

Then, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- **Annual Maintenance Cost**: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- **Total Cost for the First Year**: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cooking time for rice**: It is given that it took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than it did to cook rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is:
\[

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the Coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of $5 is calculated as \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.
   - Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (1 pound per day for 7 days).
   - The total cost for the coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the Donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for everything is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the donut: \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

Thus, the total cost of Roger's purchases is \( 44 \) dollars.

2. The cost of the bucket of fried chicken:
   \[ 8.00 \]

3. The cost of the bottle of soda:
   \[ 1.00 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items excluding the apple pie:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00 \]

Subtracting this total from the $20.00 Gus spent gives the cost of the apple pie:
\[ 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To determine the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we can use the following information:

"To determine how many good days are left in the month, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of these days over the past 30 days is as follows:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

The next three days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and we know Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first isolate the term involving \( S \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height, given its growth rate.

First, convert the current height from feet to inches:
- Current height = 20 feet
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, calculate the additional height needed:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Additional height needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

1. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
2. There are 9 people in total (Jack + 8 other adults).
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, which we'll denote as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( T \) be the age of one of the twins, and \( R \) be the age of one of the triplets.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

This means the total cost for the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - The total bill is $100.
   - Amount left: \( 125 - 100 = 25 \) dollars.

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

"To determine the total price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The prices are as follows:
- One apple costs $0.50.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollar.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:
- The total cost for the bananas is \(5 \times 1.00 = 5.00\) dollars.
- The total cost for the apples is \(12 \times 0.50 = 6.00\) dollars.
- The total cost for the oranges is \(7 \times 3.00 = 21.00\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total price of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \]

Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit is $32.00.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area will be the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then compare this total to the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to compare the total costs of each option.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The fixed cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound of blueberries picked is $1.5.
- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

The total cost of picking is:
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = \text{Fixed cost} + (\text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Pounds picked}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + 45 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of picking} = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound of blueberries at the store is $2.5.
- James would need to buy 30 pounds of blueberries.

The total cost of buying is:
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = 2.5 \times 30 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = 75 \]

Now, we can determine the savings by subtracting the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost of buying} - \text{Total cost of picking} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = 10 \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to consider the different rates at which she taps her feet based on whether her arms are raised or at her sides.

1. **Tapping Rates:**
   - When her arms are at her sides:
     - Right foot: 300 taps per minute
     - Left foot: 250 taps per minute
   - When her arms are raised:
     - Right foot: 200 taps per minute
     - Left foot: 200 taps per minute

2. **Time Distribution:**
   - Total dance time: 5 minutes
   - Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
   - Time with arms at her sides: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes

3. **Calculating Taps:**
   - **With arms at her sides (3 minutes):**
     - Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
     - Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)
   - **With arms raised (2 minutes):**
     - Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
     - Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

4. **Total Taps:**
   - Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\)
   - Combined total: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450 \text{ taps}\)

The combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant after some were sent for repair, we need to perform a few simple calculations.

First, let's find the total number of chairs initially available:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

Total chairs initially:
\[ 170 + 23 = 193 \]

Next, we need to account for the chairs that were sent to the carpenter for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

Total chairs sent for repair:
\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Now, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available:
\[ 193 - 33 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is:
160"
"To determine the number of pizza slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Bryce and his four friends and then subtract this from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Slices eaten per person = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Number of people = 2.
   - Slices eaten per person = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages.

First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The problem states that the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. Since the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages, the dog's time is:

\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the cat's time and the dog's time, divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

"To solve this problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert the feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the relationship provided in the problem: the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given relationship is:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the windows of the students' cars and the windows of the teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Total number of windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Total number of windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows:
- Number of windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total:
- Total number of windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashed is 112."
"To determine the percentage of blue spools among all the spools Candy has, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

1. **Total number of spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Percentage of blue spools:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

   Converting to a percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools is 40%.

40%"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of People:**
   - At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.

2. **Voting by Midday:**
   - By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted.
   - The number of people who voted by midday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
     \[
     5000 - 2000 = 3000
     \]

3. **Voting by 16:00:**
   - By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted.
   - The number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
     \[
     3000 - 2000 = 1000
     \]

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the ages of the individuals involved. Let's denote Dora's age as \( D \), her father's age as \( F \), and her mother's age as \( M \).

Given:
- Dora's age, \( D = 15 \) years.
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Adding these together:
\[ 4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidates A and B based on the given percentages and then subtract these from the total number of votes.

1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters:
   \[
   \text{Votes for A} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Votes for B} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
   \]

3. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidates A and B together are:
   \[
   \text{Votes for A and B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes}
   \]

4. The remaining votes, which were given to candidate C, are:
   \[
   \text{Votes for C} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
   \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of apples each person has. Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. Therefore, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, Boris gives 10 apples to Beck. After this transaction, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

Thus, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used by Peter to make the ice cubes and then subtract this from the initial 32 ounces of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the cubes:

\[
12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces of water:

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the distribution of their hobbies. The class consists of 50 students. Out of these, 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest are divided between playing video games and playing music.

We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther had:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas left}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:
\[
43

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

First, let's convert the dozens to individual items:
- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses is:
  \[
  8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, the total number of plates is:
  \[
  4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

Next, we account for the broken items:
- 10 glasses were broken, so the remaining number of glasses is:
  \[
  96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- 6 plates were broken, so the remaining number of plates is:
  \[
  48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:
\[
86 + 42 = 128
\]

Therefore, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is:
\[
128

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the transactions step by step and calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

4. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Number of large stickers left: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
   - She trades these remaining large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons: \( 27 + 60 = 87 \)

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

7. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons.
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

8. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 87
   - Total small buttons from large buttons: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 87 + 60 = 147 \)

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can start by analyzing the information given:

1. Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]
Solving for the total number of Pomeranians:
\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( T \) be the total number of puppies. We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times T = 18
\]
Solving for \( T \):
\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so it also needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases needed for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distances covered both by driving and hiking, and then sum these distances.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - The family drove for a total of 6 hours, but they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving Distance} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking Distance} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

"Given that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars, and two of those pizzas cost 30 dollars in total, we can determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas as follows:

1. Calculate the total cost of the remaining two pizzas:
   Total cost of four pizzas - Total cost of two pizzas = 64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

2. Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2:
   34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the different riding patterns over the week. 

First, let's calculate the number of rides on the usual days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- This happens for 5 days.
- Therefore, the total number of rides on the usual days is \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

Next, let's calculate the number of rides on the special days:
- On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
- Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
- This happens for 2 days.
- Therefore, the total number of rides on the special days is \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

Finally, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
- Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
- Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Initially, Bob has:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He buys 17 more fish from the pet store, which includes both orange and white fish. Let:
- \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob buys.
- \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob buys.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish bought is 17:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

2. After adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
   \[
   3 + y = 2(4 + x)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
3 + y = 2(4 + x)
\]
\[
3 + y = 8 + 2x
\]
\[
y = 8 + 2x - 3
\]
\[
y = 5 + 2x
\]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
\]
\[
x + 5 + 2x = 17
\]
\[
3x + 5 = 17
\]
\[
3x = 12
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the portion of the twenties she used.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Total value of the quarters: \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent:
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Total value of the twenties: \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.
- Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.
- Amount spent on the twenties: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the portion of the twenties she spent to find the total amount spent on lunch:
- Total amount spent: \( 35 + 120 = 155 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

For the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

For the next week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"To determine the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed the standardized test and divide it by the total number of students who took the test.

First, let's break down the data by grade:

- **Third Grade:**
  - Number of students: 500
  - Number of students who passed: 340

- **Fourth Grade:**
  - Number of students: 100
  - Number of students who passed: 40

- **Fifth Grade:**
  - Number of students: 400
  - Pass rate: Twice the fourth grade's pass rate
  - Fourth grade pass rate: 40/100 = 0.40 (or 40%)
  - Fifth grade pass rate: 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 (or 80%)
  - Number of students who passed: 0.80 * 400 = 320

Next, we sum the number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700
- Total number of students: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%

"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total quantity of tea consumed and then add the remaining tea to this amount.

First, let's calculate the total tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, we calculate the total tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we add the tea consumed by both groups:
\[ 6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the initial amount of tea is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts):
\[ 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

5. **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to calculate the total number of branches he climbed over the week. Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 during the week, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower Rose picks.
2. Subtract the petals from the flowers that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
  \[
  4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
  \]

Next, we sum these totals to find the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Since Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of these dropped flowers:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Finally, we subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the total number of marshmallows used and lost, and then determine how many are left for John and DeSean to share.

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag:** 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John:** 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean:** 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground:** 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

Next, subtract this total from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends at the arcade, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses over the 4-hour period and then convert that into dollars.

First, let's break down the playtime per quarter for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- \( g \) be the amount of sugar in ounces.
- \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance: \( z = f \).
2. The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar: \( s = g \).
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).
4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).

We also know that the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the known relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Finally, we add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Thus, John spent a total of $4500.

"Given that Robert has 20 cars and Joe has twice as many, Joe initially has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

He then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After selling and giving away cars, the number of cars Joe has left is:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To determine how much each student raised, we start by calculating the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250.

"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the walking time on the second day:**
   Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total walking time in hours:**
   We add the walking time from both days to get the total time in hours.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Convert the total time to minutes:**
   Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert the total time from hours to minutes.
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"Let's denote the number of Magic Cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance for the initial 4-hour segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance for the subsequent 6-hour segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we sum the distances from both segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how the number of animals affects the total travel time.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to account for all the sources of her funds and the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the new laptop's cost to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom has given her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current daily milk production:
   - The farmer has 3 cows.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - Therefore, the total current production is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.

2. Determine the additional milk needed to reach the target:
   - The target is 25 liters a day.
   - The current production is 15 liters a day.
   - The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.

3. Calculate the number of additional cows required:
   - Each cow produces 5 liters a day.
   - To produce an additional 10 liters, the farmer needs \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) more cows.

Thus, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each partially used glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"Given the information, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

"To determine how many groups can perform at the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will use, including the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. Each group will use:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes (on stage)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performance)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time gives:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time each group uses:

\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes per group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of these shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts with no collars:**
   - Total white shirts = 40.
   - White shirts with collars = 20.
   - Thus, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of these shirts have buttons.

4. **Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts = 50.
   - Floral shirts with buttons = 20.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 30.
   - Number of white shirts with no collars = 20.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables. Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of books is 85: \( S + A + F = 85 \).
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale is:

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Micah and Mitchell combined. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can calculate the combined sales of the boys as follows:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

This means Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, both Micah and Mitchell each sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

"To determine in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her current age, we first need to establish her current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the number of years, \( x \), from now when her age will be three times her current age. We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the relationships between the speeds of the different objects mentioned. We know the following:

1. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
2. A whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob.
3. The speed of a whatchamacallit is given as 121 meters per second.

First, let's determine the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of a whatchamacallit}}{11} \]

Substituting the given speed of the whatchamacallit:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig. Since a whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

Substituting the speed of the thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To calculate the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first determine the material required for each type of mask.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for one small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the total material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for one large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the total material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket for the Fast and the Furious movies, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa purchased.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- Deepa saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times/movie = 27 tickets

Next, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total number of tickets = 27

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 = $8

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to account for the hours he spends on various activities and subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Adding these up:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time each day.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the initial quantities of blue and red shoe boxes Tim has:

- Blue shoe boxes: 7
- Red shoe boxes: 9

Next, we calculate the number of shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing:

- Blue shoe boxes used: 3
- Red shoe boxes used: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the used shoe boxes from the initial quantities to find out how many are left:

- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

Finally, we add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes to get the total number of shoe boxes left:

- Total shoe boxes left: 4 + 6 = 10

Thus, the total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age, and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.
   \[ D = 60 \]
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   \[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the second equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Jon drives in a 30-day month and then determine how many tune-ups are required based on the car's maintenance schedule.

First, let's calculate the total distance driven:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups are required. The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \text{Tune-up interval} = 1000 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: He works twice the amount of time he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: He works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information provided and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}
   \]
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ gerbils}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
\[
3 \text{ (cats)} + 9 \text{ (dogs)} + 7 \text{ (rabbits)} + 21 \text{ (fish)} + 7 \text{ (gerbils)} = 47 \text{ pets}

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

2. **Determine the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect a total of 24 berries.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he must pick up \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10,000 gallons, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for each type of mini pastry and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, the calories in a mini cinnamon roll = \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, the calories in a mini blueberry muffin = \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

Finally, we sum the total calories from both types of pastries:

- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle covered.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance: \( 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance: \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in one day:

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Widgets per day: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \)

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Widgets per day: \( 45 \times 24 = 1080 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over 30 days:

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per day: 1440
  - Days: 30
  - Total widgets: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \)

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per day: 1080
  - Days: 30
  - Total widgets: \( 1080 \times 30 = 32400 \)

Now, we calculate the total revenue generated by each machine, given that each widget sells for $6:

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Total widgets: 43200
  - Revenue per widget: $6
  - Total revenue: \( 43200 \times 6 = 259200 \)

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Total widgets: 32400
  - Revenue per widget: $6
  - Total revenue: \( 32400 \times 6 = 194400 \)

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:

- Difference in revenue: \( 259200 - 194400 = 64800 \)

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel offers two options: a 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos or a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos. After the initial 12 hours, the hotel charges an additional 70 pesos per hour.

First, let's calculate the cost for Cameron's stay using the 12-hour option plus the additional hours:
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours (17 - 12) cost 70 pesos per hour, which totals 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock, we start by calculating the hay requirements for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Hay for Goats:**
   - Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Hay for Sheep:**
   - Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Total Hay Needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the pencils:**
   John buys 5 pencils, each costing $10.
   \[
   5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:**
   \[
   150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy:**
   Each pen costs $25.
   \[
   \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens}
   \]

Therefore, John can buy 4 pens.

"To determine the total charge for the plumbing repair, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge based on the time spent, and the cost of the parts used. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Visit Charge**: The fixed cost for visiting the house is $40.
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor is charged at $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 2.25 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 78.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Parts Charge**: The cost of the parts used is $60.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 78.75 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 178.75 \text{ dollars}

"James purchases 10 new CDs, each costing $15, for a total of:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost, the amount James actually pays is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. This means he recovers $40 from the sale of these CDs.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the amount he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From equation 2:
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From equation 3:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, substitute these expressions into the total points equation (equation 1):

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied, we calculate:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted over the course of 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we calculate:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these newly admitted patients to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert needs, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to determine the number of hours he must work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow a series of steps to calculate the total number of plants required and the associated cost.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy:**
   Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. Therefore, the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant and the space between it will occupy:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. The number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}

"To solve the problem of how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two main tasks: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

   - Total cooling on low: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Next, we calculate the net temperature change:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.
- Net temperature change: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:
     \[
     F = 2 \times 44 = 88
     \]
   - So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights:
     \[
     \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22
     \]
   - Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To determine Wilfred's age, we start by using the information provided:

1. The total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to calculate the total amount collected from all sources before the lawyer's donation. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund. Additionally, his friend donates $200. 

The total amount collected from these sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer has offered to donate three times the total amount collected from all other sources. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. With 100 guests each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person at the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church who received cookies is:

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we start by defining the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices, in terms of \( x \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into \( 8x \) parts.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which translates to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which translates to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps to determine the total number of porcupines in the park after one year.

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   \[
   \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Find the total population after a year:**
   The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   \[
   \text{length} = 25 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{width} = 14 \, \text{feet}, \quad \text{depth} = 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company provided a conversion factor of 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = V \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   G = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining, considering the rate at which the power bank lost charge over time.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge After 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased. The prices and quantities are as follows:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits already purchased:

\[ 1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25 \]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:

\[ 10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75 \]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

\[ 0.75 / 0.25 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of sweets Anne had initially. She purchased a box containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces she gave away is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

First, we calculate the growth factor:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this growth factor to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

"To determine the total number of selfies and portraits, we first need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally across 8 albums. 

First, we calculate the number of pictures per album:
\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies and 2 of the albums are portraits. We can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits as follows:

- Total number of selfies:
\[ \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

- Total number of portraits:
\[ \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to get the total number of selfies and portraits:
\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]
3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]
4. **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests check in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]
5. **Evening check-ins:** 7 more people check in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

Therefore, John has 22 bananas."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. According to the problem, the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, so \( S = 4 \). The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Price of small stuffed animal} \times \text{Number of small stuffed animals sold}) + (\text{Price of large stuffed animal} \times \text{Number of large stuffed animals sold}) \]
\[ 120 = 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption for each family member and then sum these amounts to find the weekly total.

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family each day:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day, and then scale that up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the daily mining rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, then 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total mining rate for 40 dwarves over 30 days:**
   - If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, then over 30 days they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tickets each graduate can distribute to their friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to account for the seats allocated to graduates and faculty, and then divide the remaining seats equally among the graduates.

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 6000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Seats for graduates} = 950
   \]
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop the candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount the first person received as \( x \).

The second person received \( x + 80 \).

The third person received twice what the second person received, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

Therefore, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Total days = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Determine the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

3. **Convert the fraction of a day to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. **Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:**
   - Number of painters = 4.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we start by calculating the total distance she has already covered. Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. 

First, we calculate the total distance driven:
\[ 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City, which is 1955 kilometers:
\[ 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cups she drinks over this period. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water each day, so over 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of laundry loads Greg does in a year based on his weekly routine.

First, let's break down the weekly laundry:

- Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed.
- The laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.

For the twin beds:
- He needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets.
- Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets per load, he will need:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
  \]

For the king-size bed:
- He needs to wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Since the machine can wash 1 king set per load, he will need:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheets}
  \]

So, each week, Greg does:
\[
2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load for king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of loads for the entire year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, the total number of loads in a year is:
  \[
  3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes to complete his part. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, we calculate Betsy's time as follows:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, given her current rate of saving.

First, let's calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring produces one jellyfish every second.

First, let's convert the time from hours to seconds:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14,400 seconds

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 14,400 seconds:
- One spring produces 1 jellyfish per second.
- So, in 14,400 seconds, one spring produces 14,400 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish produced by one spring by 5:
- 5 springs * 14,400 jellyfish/spring = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"Given that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we can set up the following equation to find Frankie's score:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"James decided to walk to the store, which is 4 miles away. He walked halfway to the store, realized he forgot something, and had to walk back home. Then, he walked to the store again. 

First, let's calculate the total distance James walked:
- Halfway to the store: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles
- Back home: 2 miles
- From home to the store: 4 miles

Total distance walked:
2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To determine the savings Jenny made by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to compare the total cost of buying the bananas both ways.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, determine the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets. We know two things:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]
\[
S = 20
\]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles during the month, we need to break down the sales by bike type and then calculate the total revenue.

1. **Total Bikes Sold**: 300
2. **Trekking Bikes Sold**: Half of the total bikes
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes}
   \]
3. **BMX Bikes Sold**: 15% of the total bikes
   \[
   0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes}
   \]
4. **MTB Bikes Sold**: The remaining bikes
   \[

- **Price of BMX**: Half the price of an MTB
  \[
  \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- **Price of Trekking**: $450

Now, we calculate the total revenue for each type:
- **Revenue from MTB**:
  \[
  105 \times 500 = 52,500 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- **Revenue from BMX**:
  \[
  45 \times 250 = 11,250 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- **Revenue from Trekking**:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has in a week:**
   - John has 6 periods a day and 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day.
   - He attends classes 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of periods per week is:
     \[
     8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class each week:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total minutes spent in class per week is:
     \[
     40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - John spends an additional \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on both Saturday and Sunday.
   - The extra learning time per day is:
     \[
     \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
     \[
     100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how much paint is required and its cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each pair of walls:

1. **North and South Walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **East and West Walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

Next, we add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required:
- One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint:
- Cost per gallon = $12.
- Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen took 1 unshaken soda.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Probability as a percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

We can calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first train:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second train:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to account for the initial charge, the return, and the subsequent purchases with their respective discounts.

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. **Return**: She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this amount from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. **Frying Pan Purchase**:
   - The original price of the frying pan is $20.00.
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:
     \[
     20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
     \]
   - The discounted price of the frying pan is:
     \[
     20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
     \]
4. **Towels Purchase**:
   - The original price of the set of towels is $30.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
     \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( T \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Thus, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T}{15} = 6
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two steps:

1. **Divide the total length of the ribbon into 4 equal parts:**
   - The total length of the ribbon is 100 centimeters.
   - Dividing 100 centimeters by 4 gives us:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. **Divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts:**
   - Each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.
   - Dividing 25 centimeters by 5 gives us:
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - So, each of the smaller parts is 5 centimeters long.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 centimeters.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school's population consists of 240 boys. This means that 240 boys represent 40% of the total student population.

First, we calculate the total number of students in the school. Let \( T \) represent the total number of students. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To solve for \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 600 and there are 240 boys, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of apples each person will take and then find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left.

First, let's calculate Pierre's share:
- Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples.
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, let's calculate Paul's share:
- Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples.
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add the shares of Pierre and Paul to find out how much they have taken together:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the total 12 kg to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}

"To determine the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to break down the problem into a few simple steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph) for 2 hours.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
   \[
   \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip involves driving to his parents' house and back.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Thus, the total monthly distance is:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break down the information and calculations step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production by the first four workers:**
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   For the first two workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   For the next two workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Total production by the first four workers:
   \[
   120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys produced by the end of the shift:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Total production by all five workers: 380 toys.
   - Total production by the first four workers: 200 toys.
   - Production by the fifth worker:
   \[
   380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the hourly production of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - Hourly production of the fifth worker:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}

"Let's solve the problem step by step, using algebra to find the initial number of stickers Seth had.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To determine Vince's current age, we start by establishing the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago. 

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age. Let \( V \) represent Vince’s age two years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:
     \[
     S + (S + 12) = 30
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
     \[
     S = 9
     \]
   - So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

3. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

4. **Total Eggs Painted by All Four:**
   - The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total eggs painted by all four is:
     \[
     2A + 30 = 56
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2A = 26
     \]
     \[
     A = 13
     \]
   - So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

5. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8. The number of groups (and thus the number of boxes) is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
   \[
   \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the earnings of each individual involved. 

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since this amount is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:
\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we find the combined earnings of Valerie and her brother:
\[ \text{Combined earnings} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount Jane has saved over the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 each week, we can calculate her total savings as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane continues to save $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given information: Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we need to use the principle of heat mixing. When two different temperatures of water are mixed, the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures, based on the volumes of water mixed.

Given:
- The temperature of the first mug of water is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug.
- The final temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees.

Let \( T_2 \) be the temperature of the water in the second mug. The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is:

\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (from the first mug)
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (from the second mug)
- \( T_2 \) is the unknown temperature of the second mug
- \( T_f \) is the final temperature of the mixed water, which must be at least 40 degrees.

Substituting the known values into the formula:

\[ 40 \leq \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 40 \leq \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[ 200 \leq 132 + T_2 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ 68 \leq T_2 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in both cows and chickens over the 21 days and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

4. **Total number of cows after three weeks**:
   50 initial cows + 420 added cows = 470 cows

5. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
6. **Chickens added per day**: 10
7. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks**:

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell is ordering 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem provides a ratio: it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the first 30 days: \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \).

2. **Next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the next 30 days: \( 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Total eggs for 60 days:**
   - Sum of eggs from both periods: \( 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \).

4. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - Total dozens of eggs: \( \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs hidden:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Therefore, 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. **Determine the number of eggs found by each participant:**
   - Lamar finds 5 eggs.
   - Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar: 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
   - Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy: 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
   - Mei finds half as many as Charlie: 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs found:**
   - Total found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs
   - Total found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

4. **Determine the number of eggs still hidden:**
   - Total hidden - Total found = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week from collecting garbage, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, the first two complexes have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes.
   - 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:**
   - Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week = \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total earnings per week = \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1248}\) dollars in a week."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruit production for each year from age 5 to age 10 and sum these values.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits (no production).
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Next, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Ronnie's Remaining Money:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie's remaining money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we start by noting that half of the mural is yellow. Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the remaining half of the mural to be divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints. The total amount of paint for these three colors is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses:

\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then sum these areas.

1. **Area of the bedrooms:**
   Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet.
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms:
   \[
   \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Area of the living room:**
   The living room is 5 times the area of one bedroom.
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Area of the rest of the house:**
   The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}

2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the special size box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**

"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. The number of $20 bills he gets is:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

He loses 10 of these bills on his way home, so the number of $20 bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

He then uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of $20 bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

The value of the remaining $20 bills is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thomas then triples this amount, so the new total is:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, he converts this $1200 into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he gets is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Therefore, the number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to break down the scoring for both halves and for both teams.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches, given that he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk for each subsequent day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk, so 80% of the chalk remains.
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

3. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"To determine the number of students not on varsity in Miss Albert's class, we start by calculating the number of students who are on varsity.

First, we calculate the number of girls on varsity:
- There are 12 girls in total.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity:
- There are 12 boys in total.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity:
- Total students on varsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

The total number of students in the class is:
- Total students = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.

Finally, we calculate the number of students not on varsity:
- Total students not on varsity = Total students - Total students on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then find what percentage this is of the total number of teeth.

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Next, we add the number of teeth drilled and capped to find the total number of teeth fixed:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \text{ teeth} \]

James has a total of 30 teeth. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation:**
   - Net snowballs made per hour = Snowballs made per hour - Snowballs melted per hour
   - Net snowballs made per hour = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.
   - Time required = \(\frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backward from the final count.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days:
- First day: +12 bandages
- Second day: -28 bandages
- Third day: +75 bandages

Total net change over three days:
12 - 28 + 75 = 59 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day can be calculated by subtracting the total net change from the final number of bandages:

Starting bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece of the board. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so the longer piece is \( 4x \).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need for 80 meatballs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required. Given that Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef, we can find the number of pounds needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for each pound of ground beef. Therefore, the total amount of seasoning needed for 5 pounds of ground beef is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of paintings each person has using variables:
- Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings: \( M = 27 \).

First, substitute \( M = 27 \) into the first equation:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 39 \) into the second equation:

"To determine the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40: 
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - So, the price in December is $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36
     \]
   - So, the price in January is $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so over 14 days, the total number of holes is:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Jane's peeling rate:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference between the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Labor:**
   - Mechanic's hourly rate: $50
   - Hours of work: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of labor
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of slices available. Given that there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among the 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
