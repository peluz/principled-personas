From Clue 8, we know the horse owner lives in the third house.

- House 3: Horses

From Clue 4, the dog owner lives directly left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, the radio and carnations arrangement live next to each other.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (next to each other)

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 10, there is one house between the banana and the carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 7, the apple is to the left of the cat lover.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 12, there is one house between the apple and the orange.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 13, there are two houses between the banana and the cat lover.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 5, the horse owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 6, the gameboy lives directly left of the rose bouquet.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 14, the computer does not live in the fifth house.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

The person with the phone must be in House 2.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1. So, the answer is (A) 1."
"The basketball player lives in House 4.

So, the correct answer is (C) 4."
The mystery book reader lives in the third house. So the answer is (B) 3.
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2. So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the clues given, let's figure out where each person lives:

1. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, and from clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is also in house 3. 

From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left. Since the romance book lover cannot be in house 1 (clue 4), and the root beer lover is in house 3, the only possible consecutive houses are 2 and 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the romance book lover must be in house 2 and the history book buff in house 1.

From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in the fourth house, which is consistent with our placement. 

From clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, so the tea drinker must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the history book buff and house 3 is the root beer lover, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

From clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is the romance book lover).

So, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"The cat lover lives in house 2.

Answer: (B) 2"
"The person who only drinks water lives in the 4th house. So, the answer is (E) 4."
The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So the answer is (A) 1.
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

(A) 1"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The cat lover lives in the first house.
2. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person with daffodils does not live in the second house.
4. There is one house between where the horse owner lives and where the carnations arrangement lives.
5. The person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover

From clue 2, if the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the tulips must be in house 3. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips can't be there. So, let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, and the tulips are in house 2.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From clue 3, the daffodils can't be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils

From clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the lilies must be in house 3.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. So the answer is (A) 2.
"The person who likes green lives in house 2.

(A) 2
(B) 1
(C) 3"
"The bird keeper lives in the second house. So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues given, let's figure out where each person lives.

1. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The swimmer lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white.

From clue 3 and 6, we know the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is to the left of the SUV (clue 3), and the SUV is to the left of the swimmer (clue 4), the only way to fit these is if the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the SUV in house 3.

Since the violinist does not live in the first house (clue 5), the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white (clue 7), so the person who likes white cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes white is in house 1, and the guitarist is in house 2.

Now, the baseball player and the person who likes blue have one house between them (clue 2). Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue is in house 3, and the baseball player is in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned, but based on the clues, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. So, the answer is:

(E) 1"
"Based on the clues given, let's figure out where each person lives and what they have.

1. The pianist does not live in the first house.
2. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis.
3. The pianist and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
4. The percussionist and the person wearing running shoes live next to each other.
5. The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots.
6. The person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist can't be in the first house, let's assume the pianist is in the second house and the person wearing high heels is in the third house. This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first and second houses, or vice versa.

Since the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots, and the person wearing high heels is in the third house, the person wearing boots must be in the second house. This means the person eating kiwis must be in the first house.

Now, the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the person wearing boots is in the second house, the person eating oranges must be in the first house, and the person with a television must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 3. The correct answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."

- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.

So, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"The history book buff lives in the first house. So, the answer is (B) 1."
"The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

(D) 2"
"The person who likes green lives in House 1. So, the answer is (A) 1."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the coffee drinker and tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1.

2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. So, these two must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. This means the truck driver and the carnations arrangement are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies.

6. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the tennis player is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

7. The swimmer does not live in the first house. So, the swimmer is in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house. So, the minivan is in house 4.

10. The root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The minivan is in house 4.
- The root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- The basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- The lilies are to the right of the basketball player, so the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- The daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- The coffee drinker and tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- The tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- The swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

3. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4 (Clue 2).
4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house (Clue 4), so the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. But since House 2 is the history book buff, the person eating apples must be in House 1.
5. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, and there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. So, the person wearing boots must be in House 4 (Clue 6).

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals

- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic, eating banana

The science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house. So the answer is (B) 2.
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover is in the third house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house, so they must be in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

From Clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues one by one and see where we can place the information.

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

6. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
8. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
9. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
10. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
11. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
13. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
14. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
16. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
17. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing some information:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Since the person who likes blue is in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 1, 2, or 3. The person who likes yellow is in House 3, so the person who likes red cannot be in House 3. The person who likes red cannot be in House 5, so the person who likes red must be in House 1 or 2.

The person who ate grilled cheese is in House 5, so the person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5. Since the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who likes white, the person who likes white must be in House 1, 2, or 3. The person who likes yellow is in House 3, so the person who likes white cannot be in House 3. The person who likes white cannot be in House 2 because the person who is wearing high heels is in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

The person who is wearing high heels is in House 2, so the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1 or 2. Since the person who likes white is in House 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4.

The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone, so the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who has a phone must be in House 2 or 3. Since the person who is wearing high heels is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 1, and the person who has a phone must be in House 2.

The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner, so the cat lover must be in House 1 or 2, and the dog owner must be in House 2 or 3. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 1 and the person who has a phone is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1, and the dog owner must be in House 2.

The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover, so the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers, so the person who has a gameboy must be in House 4 or 5. Since the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television, the person who owns horses must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who has a television must be in House 2 or 3. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 1 and the person who has a phone is in House 2, the person who owns horses must be in House 1, and the person who has a television must be in House 2.

The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house, so the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the person who owns horses is in House 1 and the person who has a television is in House 2, the person who is wearing boots must be in House 4 or 5.

The person who is wearing sandals is in House 2, so the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3. The person who has a gameboy must be in House 4.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We know the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (Clue 1).
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other (Clue 3).
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other (Clue 4).

From Clue 1, the running shoes are in the second house. So, the loafers must be in the first house.

The person who likes white and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other. Since the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti are also next to each other, the only way to fit everything is:

- House 1: The person who likes white and drinks water.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti and drinks milk, and is a baseball player.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

"The person who likes red lives in the first house.

So the answer is:
(C) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues one by one and try to place the characteristics in the houses.

1. The person wearing running shoes is in House 1 (Clue 13).
2. The person wearing boots is in House 3 (Clue 17).
3. The swimmer lives in House 4 (Clue 7).
4. The tennis player lives in House 2 (Clue 18).

Now, let's use the other clues to figure out the rest:

- The bird keeper cannot be in House 4 (Clue 14), so they must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5.
- The computer owner cannot be in House 1 (Clue 15), so they must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.
- The fish enthusiast cannot be in House 4 (Clue 3), so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the fish enthusiast must be in House 2.
- The dog owner cannot be in House 1 (Clue 4), so they must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, and House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the dog owner must be in House 5.
- The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet (Clue 16). Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5.
- The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house (Clue 2), so they must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, and House 5 is occupied by the computer owner, the person who has a radio must be in House 3.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement (Clue 6). Since the dog owner is in House 5, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 5.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels (Clue 1). Since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 3.
- The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player (Clue 5). Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the tennis player is in House 2, this is consistent.
- The cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 11). Since the dog owner is in House 5, the cat lover must be in House 2 and the soccer player must be in House 3.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (Clue 8). Since the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2, this is consistent.

From the above, we can see that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 2.

The correct answer is \boxed{C}."

   - House 3: Fish

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not fried rice

   - House 4: Grilled cheese

6. The cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - House 2: Cat lover

7. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
   - The cricketer must be in House 1 or 2, and the tennis player must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

8. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - The basketball player must be in House 4 or 5, and the tennis player must be in House 3 or 2.

9. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
   - The cricketer must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

10. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

11. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating apples must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

12. There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

    - The person eating oranges must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating mangos must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

15. There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 5: Pizza, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

The only remaining option for House 1 is:
- House 1: Fried rice.

So, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"The person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house. So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think this through step by step:

1. We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, so the person eating kiwis must live in the third house.
3. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the person who likes green can't be in the second house. So, the person who likes green must be in the first house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in the first house and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

From this, we can see:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

Since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green, and the person who likes green is in the first house, the person who likes white must be in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"The dog owner lives in house 2. So, the answer is (B) 2."

(A) 1
(B) 3
(C) 2"
"The number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

(D) 4"

12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. So, house 5 is taken.

From clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since house 5 is taken by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since house 5 is taken by the person who likes blue, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. Since house 5 is taken by the person who likes blue, the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 13, there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 3, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 3 or 4.

From clue 4, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.

From clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes white must be in house 3 or 4.

From clue 9, the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3 or 4.

After analyzing all the clues, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"The dog owner lives in house 2. So, the answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

1. We know the person with the vase of tulips lives in the third house.
2. The person with the computer lives in the second house.
3. The person with the phone lives directly left of the person with the television, so the phone must be in the first house and the television in the third house.
4. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth or fifth house.
5. The person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio, and the radio cannot be in the fourth house (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fourth or fifth house). So, the radio must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so the radio must be in the third house. This means the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth house.
6. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first, second, or fifth houses, it must be in the fourth house. This means the rose bouquet is in the third house.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (C) 4"
The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\).
"The person who had pizza lives in House 2.

Answer: (A) 2"

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The coffee drinker must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 8, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

Given the clues, let's place the items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

Since the person who likes green does not live in the first house, it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. Given the placement, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Since the person who likes green does not live in the first house, it must be in House 2.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)
- House 4: Horse owner

Since the person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house, they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner, so they must live in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

So, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

4. The person eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the apple eater is in house 3. So, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, the coffee drinker cannot be in house 2 (clue 3), so the coffee drinker must be in house 1. This means the milk drinker must be in house 3 (clue 1).

So, the milk drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

(A) 3
(B) 1
(C) 2"

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

Let's put this together:

- If the rose bouquet is in the first house, the sedan must be in the second house.
- If the rose bouquet is in the third house, the sedan must be in the second house.

Now, let's consider the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in the first house, the SUV must be in the second house, and the lilies must be in the third house.
- If the rose bouquet is in the third house, the SUV must be in the second house, and the lilies must be in the first house.

Since the vase of tulips can only be in the first or second house, and the rose bouquet can only be in the first or third house, let's test the scenarios:

1. If the rose bouquet is in the first house, the sedan is in the second house, and the SUV is in the second house. This doesn't work because the SUV and lilies can't both be in the second house.
2. If the rose bouquet is in the third house, the sedan is in the second house, and the SUV is in the second house. This works because the lilies can be in the first house.

"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's try to figure out where each person lives.

1. The person with daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover.

9. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
10. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

From these clues, we can start placing people:

- The SUV and the rose bouquet must be adjacent, so let's place them in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- The person with a convertible is directly left of the fish enthusiast, so they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- The fish enthusiast is to the right of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover must be in house 1 or 2, and the fish enthusiast in house 2 or 3.
- The person with daffodils is directly left of the cat lover, so they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff live directly next to each other, and the history book buff does not live in the fifth house, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns a sedan, so the bird keeper must be in houses 1, 2, or 3, and the sedan in houses 2, 3, or 4.
- The person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

By process of elimination and placing the clues, we can deduce:

- House 1: SUV, Daffodils
- House 2: Convertible, Fish Enthusiast
- House 3: Romance Book Lover, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Bird Keeper, Sedan
- House 5: History Book Buff

The person who drives a minivan lives in House 4.

So, the answer is (D) 4."
"The number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

(B) 4"
"The dog owner lives in house 2.

(A) 2
(B) 3
(C) 1"
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (A) 2."

"The person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the answer is (C) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person with the carnations lives in the fifth house.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers, so the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house and loafers in the fifth house.
3. The person with sandals cannot live in the fifth house, so they must live in the first house.
4. There is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since the fifth house is taken, the only possible positions are the second and third houses.
5. The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person with running shoes live directly next to each other, so the daffodils must be in the second house and running shoes in the third house.
6. The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in the third house.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The number of the house where the pianist lives is:

(C) 1"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in either house 1 or house 2.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in either house 1 or house 3.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house. So, the person who had stew must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 2, the person in house 1 likes white. From clue 4, the person in house 2 likes green. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

So, house 3 must have stew. From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

Now, we know:
- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Stew

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. This is consistent with our placement.

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Stew, White, White

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic are next to each other. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the first house (because the science fiction book fanatic would then be in the second house, which is not possible), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.
4. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in the third house.
5. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement and directly left of the person with the vase of tulips. So, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.
6. This leaves the romance book lover in the third house and the vase of tulips in the fourth house.
7. The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."
"The romance book lover lives in House 2.

Answer: (B) 2"
"The percussionist lives in house 1, and the person in house 2 has the radio. So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."
"The person who likes yellow lives in house 1. So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the house numbers for each characteristic:

11. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
12. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
13. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 3: Sedan
- House 4: Bird keeper (since there are two houses between the running shoes and the bird keeper)
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not minivan

Since the dog owner does not live in the third house and the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the dog owner must be in the second house.

- House 2: Dog owner

The sandals must be to the left of the bird keeper, so they must be in the second house, but since the dog owner is there, the sandals must be in the first house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Sandals
- House 3: Sedan
- House 4: Bird keeper
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not minivan

The high heels must be directly left of the truck, so the high heels must be in the third house, and the truck must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Sandals
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not minivan

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the SUV, and since the SUV cannot be in the third or fifth house, it must be in the second house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not minivan

The loafers cannot be in the fifth house, so they must be in the first house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not minivan

The fish enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Fish enthusiast

The person who owns horses must be to the right of the minivan, and since the minivan cannot be in the fifth house, it must be in the second house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Fish enthusiast

The person who owns horses must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Horses
- House 5: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the person who owns horses lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

So the answer is:
(C) 3"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. So, the person who ate fried rice and is a fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house. This means the person in the first house ate spaghetti and is a science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. So, the science fiction book fanatic in the first house ate spaghetti.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The only food left is grilled cheese, and the only book type left is mystery. So, the person in House 3 must have eaten grilled cheese and be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person with the carnations lives in house 1. So, the answer is (B) 1."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

So the answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right.
2. Each person has a different device: one has a television and one has a phone.
3. Each person wears different shoes: one wears sandals and one wears high heels.
4. Each person drinks a different drink: one drinks tea and one drinks water.
5. Each person eats a different fruit: one eats kiwis and one eats grapes.

From the clues:
- The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
- The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

So, if the person wearing high heels is to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other, it means:
- House 1 (left) must have high heels and tea.
- House 2 (right) must have sandals and grapes.

Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person with a television is in House 2, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (the only fruit left).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house. So, house 1 is the tea drinker.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. This means the cellist can't be in house 3, and the water drinker must be in house 2 or 3 if the cellist is in house 1 or 2.
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the violinist and the guitarist can't be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from clue 3)
- The violinist can't be in house 3, so the violinist must be in house 1 or 2.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (one house between them). This means the cellist must be in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). So, the water drinker would be in house 3.

This fits all the clues:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

So, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

8. The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
9. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know:
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From clue 6, the person who has a radio must be in House 2:
- House 2: Radio

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other. Since House 2 is occupied by the radio, the only possible pair is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

The only devices left are the television and the phone. The person who has a television must be to the left of the person who has a phone. Since House 1 is the only house left, it must have the television:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 3."

"The person who had pizza lives in house 2. So, the answer is (A) 2."
The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).
"Based on the clues given, let's figure out where each person lives and what they like.

5. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.
6. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist.
7. The cat lover is in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce:

- The cat lover is in the first house, so the cat lover is a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The fish enthusiast must be in the third house because the person eating a banana is in the first house, and the fish enthusiast is to the right of the person eating a banana.
- The flutist is in the third house because the flutist is to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house because the person eating oranges is to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in the first or second house. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the pianist must be in the second house.
- The person wearing running shoes is in the second house because the fish enthusiast is in the third house and the fish enthusiast is to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

So, the person in the second house is the percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.

The person in the third house is the flutist, eating apples, and a fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

The correct answer is: (C) 3"

1. The person with daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone. This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.
2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The person with a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person with a television lives to the right of the person with tulips.

From clue 3, the first house has the root beer drinker and tulips.
From clue 2, the second house has the water drinker.
From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the third house.
From clue 5, the person with the television (third house) is to the right of the person with tulips (first house), so the tulips must be in the first house and the television in the third house.

Now, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses, but since the first house has tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house and the phone in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. The person wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Not boots

5. The person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

7. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Not kiwis

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- House 1: Grapes, Loafers (from clue 1 and 3)
- House 2: Water, Phone (from clue 2 and 3)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (from clue 4, 5, and 6)

1. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Oranges

2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible must be in consecutive houses.

3. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1.

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.

5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Horses

6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Oranges

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. We know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. So, they must be in either house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 1.
2. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader, so the cellist can't be in house 2, and the mystery book reader can't be in house 1.
3. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover, so the history book buff can't be in house 2, and the cat lover can't be in house 1.

Let's try the arrangement where the root beer lover is in house 2 and the guitarist is in house 1:
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.
- The cellist can't be in house 2, so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader can't be in house 1, so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff can't be in house 2, so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover can't be in house 1, so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This doesn't work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1.

Now, let's try the arrangement where the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2:
- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- The cellist can't be in house 2, so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader can't be in house 1, so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff can't be in house 2, so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover can't be in house 1, so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This works:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person living there, and each person has different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who had stew lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Using Clue 4, the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. So, the mystery book reader must be in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Using Clue 5, the person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Using Clue 1, the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Using Clue 3, the golfer lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Using Clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, using Clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The percussionist lives in house 3.

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"The person eating apples lives in the fourth house. So, the answer is (A) 4."
"The coffee drinker lives in House 3.

So, the answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3. So, the answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's think through this step by step. We have four houses and different people living in each one. Each person has a different car, favorite color, lunch, sport, and musical instrument. We need to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the right of the tennis player.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live next to each other.

13. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
14. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
15. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player is in house 2. From clue 9, the SUV owner is in house 4, which means the basketball player is also in house 4. From clue 13, the person who likes white is in house 4.

Since the flutist is in house 3 (clue 7), and the cellist and flutist live next to each other (clue 10), the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the soccer player is in house 2, so the cellist must be in house 3.

Now, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan (clue 3). Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3.

The answer is: \boxed{C}"

6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
7. The person who ate stew lives in the fifth house, because there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew.
8. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes red lives in the fifth house.
10. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, because there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
12. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, because the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
13. The person who is a root beer lover does not live in the third house.
14. The person who likes green lives in the third house, because the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other, and the person who likes red lives in the fifth house.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

Answer: (D) 3"
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's try to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic, so the science fiction book fanatic is in the fifth house.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes white is in the first or second house.
4. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader is in the third house.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives, so the person who had stew is in the fifth house.
8. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes white is in the first or second house.
9. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so the person who drives a minivan is in the second house.
10. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house.
11. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person who drives a convertible is in the fourth house.

14. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue, so the person who ate spaghetti is in the fifth house.
15. The person who had pizza lives two houses to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the person who likes yellow is in the fifth house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

From the clues, we can deduce that the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 1."
"The person who had pizza lives in House 3.

So, the answer is (B) 3."
"The clues tell us that:
1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

Since the basketball player and the violinist can't both live in the second house, let's think about it differently. The second house must be occupied by one of these people, and the other person's characteristic (instrument or sport) must be in the first or third house.

If the violinist is in the second house, the basketball player must be in either the first or third house. But the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't be in the third house. This means the cricketer is in the first house, and the cellist is in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

This leaves the basketball player in the third house, but since the cellist is already there, the basketball player must be in the first house. This means the soccer player is in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The tea drinker lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."

9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2 and 11, we know:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

Since the flutist and coffee drinker are the same person, and the horse owner is in House 4, we can place:
- House 4: Flutist, Coffee drinker, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in House 4, so the tennis player must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. This means the tennis player and the water drinker are in House 1 and 2, or House 2 and 3.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they are in House 1 and 2, or House 2 and 3.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

Since the violinist does not live in House 3 (clue 6), the violinist must be in House 2. This means the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

So, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

3. The person owning a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person owning an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4, since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3, since the person in House 3 owns a sedan, we can place the sedan in House 3.

From clue 2, the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, the only shoes left are running shoes. Since the cat lover, high heels, and boots are already assigned, the running shoes must be in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
