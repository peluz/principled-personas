"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4, as there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis
- House 2: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)
- House 3: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. Therefore, the percussionist must live in House 3.

- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

Summarizing the placements:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 4.

10. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
    - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Apples
- House 2: Pizza (since it must be next to mangos)
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Mangos (since it must be next to pizza)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing high heels (House 3) is not the root beer lover, tea drinker, or coffee drinker. Therefore, the root beer lover, tea drinker, and coffee drinker must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 or 3 (since it is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti and to the left of the coffee drinker).

- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (since it is to the left of the person who drives a convertible).

- The person who drives a truck must be in house 1 (since it is to the left of the person who owns an SUV).

- The person who owns an SUV must be in house 2 (since it is to the right of the person who drives a truck).

- The person who is wearing loafers (House 1) is not the root beer lover, tea drinker, or coffee drinker. Therefore, the root beer lover, tea drinker, and coffee drinker must be in houses 2, 3, or 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti and to the left of the coffee drinker).

- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1 (since it is to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes).

- The person who is a coffee drinker must be in house 4 (since it is to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes).

- The person who is a root beer lover must be in house 2 (since it is to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes).

Therefore, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

The correct answer is: (B) 2."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, which aligns with the first clue.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
6. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.
- The coffee drinker is in house 4.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who had stew is in house 3.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who had pizza cannot be in house 1, so it must be in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since houses 2 and 3 are already occupied, pizza must be in either house 4 or 5.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who only drinks water is in house 5, which aligns with the first clue.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Radio
- House 3 or 4: Carnations

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 1 or 4: Banana

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 4: Cat lover

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Apple

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can conclude:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their book preference and sport.

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Starting with the golfer:
- Clue 5: The golfer lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Golfer

Next, we use Clue 3:
- The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
  - This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible). The only possible positions are:
    - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
    - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Now, using Clue 1:
- The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
  - This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible). The only possible positions are:
    - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
    - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Since the swimmer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 4), the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover

Finally, using Clue 2:
- The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
  - Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as per Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person based on their favorite color, drink, and book preference.

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the white person and the coffee drinker must be in positions that are two houses apart.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green must be to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's place the root beer lover (red) in house 3.

- Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who likes red is in house 3.
- The romance book lover must be in house 2 (since they live directly left of the history book buff).
- The history book buff must be in house 1 (since the romance book lover is in house 2).

Now, we need to place the white person and the coffee drinker. From clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green.

- If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.
- If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.
- If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff).
- If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person in house 1 likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a radio.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), and the person in house 2 had pizza (from Clue 4), we can deduce:
- The person in house 1 has a radio.
- The person in house 2 likes green.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Therefore, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the third or fifth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
12. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
13. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
14. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
16. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- The dog owner (2nd house) and the person who likes red (3rd house) are next to each other.
- The person who likes milk (1st house) and the person who likes blue (2nd house) are next to each other.
- The person who ate spaghetti (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who likes red (3rd house).
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice (4th or 5th house).
- The bird keeper (1st or 2nd house) and the fish enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) are one house apart.
- The root beer lover (2nd or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are next to each other.
- The fantasy book enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are next to each other.
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are two houses apart.
- The person who likes yellow (1st or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are two houses apart.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the cellist must be in the second and third houses, respectively.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, fruits, lunches, and flowers. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know that the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples. From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis. From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the tulips must be in house 3, and so on.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils can only be in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses. Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio, and the first house must have the horses.

So, we can summarize:
- First house: Phone and Horses
- Second house: Boots and Radio

The only characteristic left is high heels, which must belong to the person in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses step by step.

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Starting with the baseball player in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Given that the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Kiwis

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

From clue 3, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house, the person in house 2 must be driving a truck.

From clue 1 and clue 2, since the person who drives a truck (house 2) and the person who owns an SUV (neither house 1 nor house 3) are accounted for, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

Using Clue 11:
- The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.
- The person who owns an SUV must live in the second house.

Now, we have:

"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

Given this information, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The only book type left for the third house is science fiction, and the only lunch type left for the first house is fried rice, and the only lunch type left for the second house is pizza.

20. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
21. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
22. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, and House 5 is the stew eater, the remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 3 and Clue 7:
- House 2: History book buff, daffodils
- House 3: Loafers

From Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- House 1: Not yellow
- House 3: Not yellow

From Clue 6:
- House 3: Loafers

From Clue 7:
- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 8:
- The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since House 3 has loafers, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2, and the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

From Clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2 and the person who is wearing boots is in House 1, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1, and the person who likes blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 5:
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2 (history book buff) or House 3 (loafers), the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- House 1: Not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, must be science fiction book fanatic and green
- House 3: Not yellow, not daffodils, must be lilies and green

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person in the second house drives a minivan, and the person in the third house is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person in the fourth house is wearing sandals, and the person in the fifth house drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other, so the person in the second house is wearing boots.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From these deductions, we can summarize the information as follows:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3, as the person who owns a sedan is in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player cannot be in House 3 (since the cat lover is there), so the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the soccer player would be in House 2, and the truck driver would be in House 3, which satisfies the condition that the truck driver is to the right of the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 1.

14. **Clue 18**: The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
15. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

Starting with Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house.

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 7. The vase of tulips must be to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, and the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the vase of tulips would be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips cannot be there. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Using Clue 8, the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house.

Using Clue 9, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the gameboy. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies would be in the first house, and the gameboy would be in the third house.

Using Clue 10, the television does not live in the second house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the television would be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television would be in the first or third house.

Using Clue 11, the fish enthusiast is to the left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the fish enthusiast would be in the first house.

Using Clue 12, the bird keeper is to the right of the convertible. If the convertible is in the first house, the bird keeper would be in the second house, but the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, so the convertible must be in the third house, and the bird keeper in the fourth house.

Using Clue 13, the guitarist is to the left of the horses. If the horses are in the fifth house, the guitarist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the horses must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the third house.

Using Clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the SUV live next to each other. If the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the SUV would be in the second house.

Using Clue 15, the percussionist is to the left of the carnations. If the carnations are in the fifth house, the percussionist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the carnations must be in the fifth house, and the percussionist in the fourth house.

Using Clue 17, the pianist is to the left of the SUV. If the SUV is in the second house, the pianist would be in the first house.

Using Clue 18, the percussionist is to the left of the cat lover. If the percussionist is in the fourth house, the cat lover would be in the fifth house.

Using Clue 19, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the guitarist. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist would be in the second house, but the fish enthusiast is in the first house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

   - Since the lilies are in house 2, the daffodils must be in house 1.

6. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - The coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1.
   - Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player must be in house 3.

7. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - The tennis player is in house 3, and the tea drinker must be in house 4.

8. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 2 or 3.

   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

4. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4. But we already know House 4 is the banana eater, so this must be re-evaluated. The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4, and the banana eater must be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 is the history book buff, so the person eating apples must be in House 1.

6. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in House 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 2, the person eating mangos must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person eating apples is in House 1, the person wearing boots must be in House 4.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above deductions:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

The person in the second house is not wearing loafers, so they must be wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Person who owns horses

From Clue 5, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. The only possible pair is (2, 3), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the flutist and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 4: Violinist

From Clue 8, the violinist lives in the fourth house. This is already placed.

From Clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house. This is already placed.

- House 5: Bird keeper

From Clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. The only possible pair is (1, 2), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the guitarist and the percussionist must be in houses 1 and 2.

"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their sport and lunch choice.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 3).

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti are (1, 3) or (2, 4). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6:
- Stew is left of spaghetti, so Stew: House 1, Spaghetti: House 3.

From clue 5:
- Pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Given the clues, the consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: The person who likes white, drinks water, and is a swimmer.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti, drinks milk, and is a baseball player.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.
3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader. Since the tennis player cannot live in the first house (clue 2), the tennis player must live in the second house. Consequently, the second house must be occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by placing the cellist in the first house as per Clue 4:

1. **House 1:** Cellist

Next, we use Clue 5, which states that the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person who likes red must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person who likes red must be in House 4.

We will try the basketball player in House 3 and the person who likes red in House 4:

- **House 2:** Running shoes (from Clue 8, the basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes)
- **House 3:** Basketball player
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 7, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 1 and the person who likes yellow in House 2:

- **House 1:** Flutist
- **House 2:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 3:** Basketball player
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Next, we use Clue 9, which states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 2 and the person who likes yellow in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 6, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1:

- **House 1:** Person who is wearing boots
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Next, we use Clue 10, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Since the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cricketer
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 11, which states that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 4 (but House 4 is the person who likes red, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 3 and the person who likes yellow in House 4:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Now, we use Clue 12, which states that the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Finally, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing high heels cannot be in House 4 (Clue 3).
- The violinist cannot be in House 4 (Clue 2).
- The golfer cannot be in House 4 (Clue 1).

Since the cellist is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the person who only drinks water, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 4 and the person who likes yellow in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Flutist

Now, we use Clue 11, which states that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 4 (but House 4 is the flutist, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Using clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white must live in the second and third houses, respectively.

Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer must live in the third house.

Clue 5 indicates that the soccer player lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must also be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

Clue 2 states that the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

Clue 4 tells us that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is consistent.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."

3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other (Clue 3).
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house (Clue 4).
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house (Clue 5).

From Clue 4, the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house.

From Clue 1, the kiwi eater is in the first house.

From Clue 5, since the dog owner is not in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From Clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live next to each other. Given the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**

   - This means if mangos are in House 2, red must be in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV must be in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples must be in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 2, red must be in House 3. But red is already in House 3, so mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From these deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

Since the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person who likes green is House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues and the setup of the houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Soccer player
   - House 2: Mystery book reader

2. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the soccer player is in House 1 and the mystery book reader is in House 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

3. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the only person left is the root beer lover, and the only house left is House 2, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we need to place the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D) such that there are two houses between them:
- If D is in house 2, T must be in house 4.

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in a position to the right of the fish enthusiast (F):
- M must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Finally, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Thus, the cat lover (C) must be in house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions step-by-step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (Clue 5).
2. The root beer lover lives in the second house (Clue 3).
3. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk (Clue 2). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 1). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker, so the blue person must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (Clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Starting with Clue 6, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. This means the second house is occupied by someone who likes blue.

Next, let's use Clue 7: The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house. Consequently, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house.

Now, let's use Clue 3: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who is eating grapes is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the first house as well. This means the basketball player is eating oranges and is the one who is wearing boots.

Using Clue 1: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the basketball player (who is eating oranges) is in the first house, the cricketer must be in the third house. This means the cricketer is wearing loafers and is the one who is eating mangos.

Now, let's use Clue 2: The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the baseball player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the third house. This means the cat lover is the one who is wearing sandals and likes green.

Finally, using Clue 4: The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the cat lover likes green and is in the third house, the dog owner must be in the first house. This means the dog owner is the one who is wearing boots and likes white.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

From clue 16, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who likes milk is in house 3. From clue 8, the guitarist is in house 3, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker is in house 5, and the tennis player is in house 4.

From clue 15, the fish enthusiast is in house 5, and the swimmer is in house 3.

From clue 6, the pianist is in house 3, and the bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 4, the flutist is in house 5, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 7, the guitarist is in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice is in house 3, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 18, the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing boots

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4 and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - These two must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**

- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3.

   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - Let's denote the house with grapes as G and the house with daffodils as D. G and D are 2 houses apart.

6. **Clue 17**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

7. **Clue 18**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

8. **Clue 14**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - Let's denote the house with carnations as C and the house with the cricketer as Ck. C and Ck are next to each other.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1, the person with lilies must be the golfer. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the soccer player in house 3 has daffodils, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the person with tulips must be the basketball player in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- Clue 7: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 7).

Since the pianist is in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

- Clue 1: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
- Clue 6: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- Clue 10: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in a house with a lower number than the root beer lover.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house with a lower number than the person who only drinks water.

5. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- **Tea drinker in house 3.**
  - House 3: Tea drinker

- **Person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
  - This means the person who had stew is in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2 or 3.

- **Root beer lover is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
  - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1 or 2, and the root beer lover is in house 2, 3, or 4.

- **Person who only drinks water is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
  - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4, and the person who only drinks water is in house 3, 4.

- **Person who is wearing running shoes is to the left of the person who had stew.**
  - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew is in house 2 or 3.

- **Person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
  - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

- **Person who ate grilled cheese is not in the first house.**
  - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Combining Clues:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese).
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

### Arranging the Remaining Information:

- The person who ate stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

### Conclusion:

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Basketball player

3. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Cricketer

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Since the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer, and the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step-by-step:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person is a science fiction book fanatic and the other is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we can infer:
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot live in house 2, as the root beer lover would then have to live in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can summarize the following:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover, does not like white

Since the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Given that the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the information step by step.

1. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
2. **The person who had stew lives in the second house.**

6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Fried Rice
  - House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots (since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 and the person who likes white must be in House 1)
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 1)
- House 3: Likes red, history book buff (from Clue 6 and Clue 7)

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**

  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)

- **House 2:**

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This means the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the green lover must be in the first or second house. But the yellow lover is in the first house, so the green lover must be in the second house.

   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**

Let's start placing the known information:

- Swimmer: House 3
- Violinist: House 2
- Cricketer: House 4
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 6, the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 4, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in Houses 3 and 4, but the swimmer is already in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 2, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist, so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

   - House 4: Television

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. However, House 4 is already assigned to Television, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

The only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know that the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. From Clue 3, the person with running shoes cannot be in the third house, so the only possible positions are:
- House 1: Running shoes, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Rose bouquet

From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew. This means:
- If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
- If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
- If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
- If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
- If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
- If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
- If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
- If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person with the lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the saxophonist cannot live in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From the above deductions, we can conclude:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 14**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, their musical instruments, flowers, drinks, and favorite books. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 14**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 13**: The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
8. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

10. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
11. **Clue 11**: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 9**: The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
14. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 2 and Clue 10, we know:
- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we can place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:
- Since they are next to each other, we need to find a way to fit these pairs into the remaining houses.

From Clue 13 and Clue 7, we can place the history book buff and the percussionist:
- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we can place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:
- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know:
- Violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 11, we know the science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.

From Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house.

Using Clue 5, we can place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:
- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we can place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:
- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is already occupied by the yellow lover, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1 and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Green (favorite color)

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations and House 3 has yellow, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the horses and blue must be in House 1 or House 3. However, House 1 already has carnations, so the horses and blue must be in House 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - The horses are in House 3, so the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - The percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the percussionist and the truck must be in House 1 and 3.

7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - The sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Carnations, Horses, Blue
- House 2: Tulips, Bird Keeper
- House 3: Yellow, Rose Bouquet

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist. 

From clue 3, since the first house is to the left of the second house, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person in the second house must be the mystery book reader (since the only remaining book type is mystery) and likes red.

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer:

1. The golfer lives in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 3).
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives (Clue 1).

Since the history book buff is in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be there. The golfer is in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

This leaves the swimmer to be in the first house, as there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 1, we know:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 owns horses.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2, as the history book buff must be in house 2 or 1 to the right of them.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**
- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti).
- This would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals.

**Scenario 2:**
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff.
- This would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals.

Given these scenarios, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- In Scenario 1, the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, so the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- In Scenario 2, the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, so the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Since we need to find the house number where the person who ate fried rice lives, and based on the consistency of the clues, the correct answer is:

(B) 2

This is because if the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, the person in house 1 would have eaten fried rice, and this scenario fits all the given clues."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.
- From Clue 2, since the flutist does not live in the first house, the flutist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

- **Clue 6:** The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Using **Clue 8**:
- There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Next, using **Clue 1**:
- There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Using **Clue 4**:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, using **Clue 2**:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 5**:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Using **Clue 7**:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using **Clue 9**:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:

   - If the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the clues, let's deduce the positions:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the person who likes blue to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively. Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

From clue 5, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only remaining options for the basketball player are the second or third house. However, the violinist is in the first house, so the basketball player must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Hence, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

   - Clue 4: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - Clue 13: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they are in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist and the kiwi-eater are in houses 1 and 3, respectively, and the pianist is in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, the first house is occupied by the kiwi-eater.
- The fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we can deduce that the root beer lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know that the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must live in the first house and the cellist must live in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step:

   - House 4: Boots

3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips
   - House 5: Loafers

4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - House 1: Sandals

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - Possible positions: House 2 and House 3

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes

7. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Consistent with Clue 5 and Clue 4.

8. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - Consistent with Clue 2.

From the above, we can deduce the following arrangement:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white, and the swimmer is to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who likes white in the middle.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Given Clue 2, the person in house 1 likes white. From Clue 4, the person in house 2 likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 must be wearing boots (to satisfy Clue 6), the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 1: White, Boots, Red (since white and green are already taken)
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green (already assigned)
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White (since red and green are already taken)

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house (House 1), the coffee drinker must be in the first house as well because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- This means the person in the second house (House 2) must be wearing sandals.

Since the coffee drinker is in House 1 and the science fiction book fanatic is also in House 1, the romance book lover must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we can deduce that the percussionist must live in house 1, as it is directly left of house 2. Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

Let's consider the possible positions for the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow:

- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2. But house 2 already has the convertible, so this is not possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1. This is possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 0, which is not possible.

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who owns a sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Person who likes white

Now, we need to assign the colors and cars to these people. We know:
- The person in house 2 (sedan and convertible) is not the one who likes white or yellow.
- The person in house 1 (yellow) is not the one who owns a sedan.
- The person in house 3 (white) is not the one who owns a sedan.

Since the person in house 2 owns a sedan and has a convertible, the person in house 1 must like yellow, and the person in house 3 must like white. The only car left for the person in house 1 is the minivan, and the only car left for the person in house 3 is the sedan.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow, Minivan
- House 2: White, Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Blue, Sedan

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic and the fantasy book enthusiast are already assigned, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels (House 1) must be to the left of the person wearing sandals (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker (House 1) must be to the left of the person with a television (House 2).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes.

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Let's test the possible placements:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who only drinks water step-by-step:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4:
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5:
- There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the third and fifth houses are occupied, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Given that the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Since House 4 is occupied by pizza, we can place the radio and computer in the other houses. Let's use Clue 1 to place the gameboy and computer next to each other.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2) or (House 2, House 3) or (House 3, House 4) or (House 4, House 5)

Since House 4 is occupied by pizza, the only possible pairs are:
- (House 1, House 2) or (House 2, House 3)

Let's assume:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now, we need to place the remaining devices and lunches. Using Clue 5:
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - House 3: Grilled cheese
   - House 4: Pizza
   - House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 3:
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Grilled cheese
   - House 4: Pizza
   - House 5: Spaghetti
   - Therefore, House 1 must be the radio.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 2:
7. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - The only remaining devices are the phone and television.
   - Since House 1 is the radio, House 2 is the computer, and House 3 is the grilled cheese, the only possible positions for the phone and television are House 4 and House 5.
   - Therefore, House 4 must be the television and House 5 must be the phone.

Finally, we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Television
- House 5: Phone

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 3."

- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.

5. **Clue 12**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the baseball player must be in house 5 and the tennis player in house 4.

Now, the positions are:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Baseball player
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

6. **Clue 11**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. The saxophonist is in house 3, so the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

Now, the positions are:

- House 4: Baseball player
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

7. **Clue 10**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. The stew eater must be in house 1 and the banana eater in house 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater. So, the stew eater must be in house 4 and the banana eater in house 5.

Now, the positions are:
- House 1: Stew eater
- House 2: Grilled cheese eater
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Banana eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. The fried rice eater must be in house 1 and the orange eater in house 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater. So, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 and the orange eater in house 4.

Now, the positions are:
- House 1: Fried rice eater
- House 2: Grilled cheese eater
- House 3: Orange eater
- House 4: Banana eater
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

Now, the positions are:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Pianist
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Banana eater
- House 5: Percussionist

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the bird keeper cannot live in house 1. Given Clue 1, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

With the bird keeper in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (since they live to the right of the bird keeper).

Thus, the pizza eater must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A). 

Here’s the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house (Clue 5).
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house (Clue 6).
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7).
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper (Clue 8).
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9).

Given that the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the first or second house (Clue 8). The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so they must be in the first or second house as well (Clue 9).

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so they must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so they must be in the third or fourth house.

The only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A)."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 10:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cat lover

   - The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

9. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - The person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

5. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

Using Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can deduce:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. Since House 2 is occupied by grapes, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green must be to the left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore:
- House 1: Green
- House 3: Red

From Clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Therefore:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 3: Red

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 2 or House 4. Given that House 2 is occupied by grapes, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

1. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone.
2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The person with a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person with a television lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

From clue 3, the first house has the root beer drinker and the vase of tulips. Clue 2 tells us the second house has the water drinker. Clue 4 states the television is not in the second house, so it must be in the third house. Clue 5 indicates the person with the television is to the right of the person with the vase of tulips, which means the vase of tulips must be in the first house, and the television in the third house.

Since the daffodils and phone are adjacent (clue 1), and the first house has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

1. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Loafers

2. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given these clues, let's place the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

- House 1: Baseball player
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: (Not baseball or golfer, must be cricketer)

From Clue 1, the golfer cannot be in house 3, so the golfer must be in house 2. This means the baseball player must be in house 3.

Now, let's place the flowers:
- From Clue 4, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be next to each other. Since the baseball player is in house 3, the person with horses must be in house 2, and the person with carnations must be in house 1.

   - Since House 3 is occupied by horses, the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Mangos

4. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Convertible, Horses

5. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person driving a convertible is in House 3, the person driving a truck must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Mangos, Convertible

6. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - The dog owner cannot be in House 3, so the dog owner must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Oranges, Bird Keeper

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. **Clue 4:** There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
7. **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
9. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the romance book lover:
- From Clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- From Clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first or last house. The only possible arrangement is:
  - Mystery book reader in house 1, Romance book lover in house 3, History book buff in house 4.

Next, we place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.
- From Clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the first house.
- Given the above, the only possible arrangement for the percussionist and the guitarist is:
  - Guitarrist in house 2, Percussionist in house 3, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Now, we place the remaining people and their preferences:
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. The only remaining houses are 4 and 5. Since the person who had stew is in house 4, the saxophonist must be in house 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Flutist
4. Stew
5. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.
7. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
8. The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. The person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
10. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover.
11. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
12. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
13. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
14. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
15. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.
16. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
17. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, the first house is the sedan. From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in the third house. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in the second house (since the romance book lover is in the third house).

From Clue 15, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 16, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the fourth house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house. But the romance book lover is in the third house, so this is a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow must be in the second and third houses. But the romance book lover is in the third house, so the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the third house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the sedan is in the first house, the SUV must be in the second house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. But the romance book lover is in the third house, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house.

The answer is: (E) 5."

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3.

From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- From Clue 2, the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 or house 3, and they must be to the right of the dog owner.
- From Clue 1, the person with the carnations arrangement must live to the right of the bird keeper.

Let's consider the possible positions for the dog owner:
- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, which is not possible.

Thus, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

Since the dog owner is in house 1 and the bird keeper is in house 2, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3, but this contradicts the carnations arrangement being in house 3. Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 3.

- The dog owner is in house 3.
- The bird keeper must be in house 2.
- The carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (to the right of the bird keeper).

This leaves the vase of tulips for house 2, which is to the right of the dog owner in house 1.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, we know:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Eating banana

From Clue 10, the person with loafers cannot be in House 3, so:
- House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

From Clue 1, the person with high heels must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3. Therefore, the person with high heels cannot be in House 3.

From Clue 4, the swimmer is in House 4.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, and the cricketer is in House 4.

From Clue 2, the person with apples cannot be in House 3.

- House 2: Basketball player

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the information step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangos

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Mangos
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3), so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first or second house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

From clue 2, the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who is eating mangos cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, since the person eating apples is in the first house and the tea drinker must be to the right of the person eating apples, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with the current arrangement.

From clue 5, the person who is eating kiwis cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house. But the first house is already occupied by the person eating apples, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fourth house.

Thus, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."

12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, which aligns with clue 7. This means the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - House 1: ?

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions of the people, their musical instruments, shoes, devices, and cars.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From Clue 5 and Clue 6, we can deduce the following:
- The truck and minivan must be in adjacent houses, with the minivan to the right of the truck.
- The flutist must be directly left of the minivan.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right. If we place the truck in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 1. This satisfies Clue 5 and Clue 6.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- The truck and gameboy are adjacent, so the gameboy must be in house 2.
- The minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in house 2.

This creates a conflict because the gameboy and cellist both cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the truck must be in house 2, the gameboy in house 3, and the minivan in house 1. This satisfies Clue 5 and Clue 6.

Now, the flutist must be in house 1, the cellist in house 2, and the gameboy in house 3.

Next, we use Clue 4 and Clue 7:
- The high heels and television are adjacent, so the percussionist must be in house 3.
- The boots are to the right of the percussionist, so the boots must be in house 3.

This leaves the flutist in house 1, the cellist in house 2, and the percussionist in house 3.

Finally, we assign the devices and cars:
- The flutist in house 1 must have a phone (Clue 1).
- The cellist in house 2 must have a television.
- The gameboy in house 3 must have a minivan.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Now, we know:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.
- The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given these clues, let's place the characteristics:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly tells us that the bird keeper is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns horses is in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1.

Given these clues, we can start placing the known elements:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

4. **House 2: Oranges** (since the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, and there are two houses between the pianist and the person who is wearing sandals)
5. **House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast** (since the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)
6. **House 1: Green** (since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue, and green must be in House 1 or 2, with blue in House 2 or 3)
7. **House 3: Blue** (since green is in House 1 and blue must be in House 3)
8. **House 2: Yellow** (since there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the person who likes yellow lives, and yellow must be in House 2 or 3, with the romance book lover in House 4)
9. **House 4: High heels** (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels)
10. **House 3: Romance book lover** (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the romance book lover must be in House 3)

    - If the person who likes white is in house \( n \), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house \( n+2 \) or \( n-2 \).

11. **Clue 11:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
    - The root beer lover is not in house 3.

12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives.
    - If the person who ate fried rice is in house \( n \), the person who had stew is in house \( n+2 \) or \( n-2 \).

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - The coffee drinker is in a house to the left of the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White
- House 3: Daffodils

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 12 and 13**:
   - The first house has a vase of tulips and someone who ate spaghetti.

2. **Clue 14**:
   - The rose bouquet is not in the second house.

3. **Clue 15**:
   - The soccer player is to the right of the baseball player. This means the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti, the baseball player and tennis player cannot be in houses 1 and 2. Thus, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 7**:
   - The bouquet of lilies is to the right of the soccer player. This means the soccer player cannot be in house 4, and the lilies owner cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 8**:
   - The minivan and convertible are next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

6. **Clue 9**:
   - The fried rice eater is to the right of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot be in house 4, and the fried rice eater cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 10**:
   - The rose bouquet is to the right of the sedan. This means the sedan cannot be in house 4, and the rose bouquet cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 3**:
   - The sedan is to the left of the truck. This means the sedan cannot be in house 4, and the truck cannot be in house 1.

9. **Clue 2**:
   - The minivan is not in the third house. This means the minivan must be in houses 1 or 2.

10. **Clue 4**:
    - The bird keeper is to the left of the cat lover. This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 4, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

11. **Clue 5**:
    - The fish enthusiast is to the left of the stew eater. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 4, and the stew eater cannot be in house 1.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the known elements:

- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti
- House 2: (Baseball player, Tennis player, Minivan/Convertible)
- House 3: (Sedan/Truck, Lilies)
- House 4: (Soccer player, Cat lover, Stew, Truck/Minivan)

From Clue 6, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is to the left of the tennis player, the baseball player is in house 2 and the tennis player is in house 3.

From Clue 8, the minivan and convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From Clue 3, the sedan must be in house 3, and the truck in house 4.

From Clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 9, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 10, the rose bouquet must be in house 4.

From Clue 11, the stew eater must be in house 4.

From Clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2, so it must be in house 4.

From Clue 15, the soccer player must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."

   - If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots is in house 2.

### Combining the Clues:

- If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then:
  - The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
  - The person who is eating grapes is in house 1.

  - The mystery book reader is in house 2.

This combination satisfies all the clues:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.
- House 2: Person who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader.

- The person in house 1 (who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots) must be the one who drives a convertible.
- The person in house 2 (who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader) must like red, eat oranges, and wear running shoes.

The fantasy book enthusiast must be the person in house 1, as the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of the people in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the basketball player and the violinist both live in the second house, this is a contradiction unless we interpret the clues differently. The clues might be referring to different characteristics of the people.

Let's assume:
- The second house is occupied by the violinist.
- The basketball player must be in either the first or third house.

From clue 1, the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, so the cricketer must be in the first house. Therefore, the cellist must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player cannot be in the second house (it is occupied by the violinist), the basketball player must be in the first or third house. Given that the cricketer is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house.

This leaves the soccer player in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics correctly for each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.**
2. **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
3. **The flutist lives in the fourth house.**
4. **The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **The guitarist does not live in the third house.**
6. **The violinist does not live in the third house.**
7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.**

9. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
10. **The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.**
11. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist lives in house 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1, as they are next to each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the people, fruits, cars, and flowers in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - House 3: Daffodils
   - House 4: Minivan

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV (confirms with Clue 4)

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Apples

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since House 3 is occupied by daffodils and House 4 by the minivan, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). Since House 3 is already occupied by daffodils, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the SUV, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 1, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 or House 5.
   - Since House 3 is occupied by daffodils, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the root beer lover step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct house numbers for each person.

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the violinist lives in the first house (House 1), the person in House 2 must be the bird keeper.
- The person with the computer lives in House 1 (to the left of the bird keeper in House 2).

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Given the positions of the tea drinker and the person who likes blue, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses. However, the third house is already occupied by the tea drinker, so they must be in the first and second houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must be in the second house, and the person who likes green must be in the third house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house. Given that the first house has running shoes and carnations, and the second house has tulips, the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples are next to each other, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

In the context of fictional character analysis, Apollo from Greek mythology is a god with a wide array of divine powers, including superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to manipulate natural elements. These attributes would give him a significant advantage in a physical confrontation. On the other hand, D'Artagnan from ""The Three Musketeers"" is a skilled human swordsman known for his bravery and combat prowess, but he lacks any supernatural abilities. While D'Artagnan is a formidable opponent, the sheer power and versatility of Apollo's divine abilities would likely give him the upper hand in a hypothetical battle. Therefore, it is unlikely that all of the famous D'Artagnan figures could defeat Apollo, even in numbers."

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with some aspects of a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excelled at swift and efficient communication but her role did not involve tasks such as sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. While her divine speed would be an asset, her primary function in mythology was more about communication than physical delivery.

Hermes, as the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, would bring his speed and adaptability to the job. However, his role also included trickery and guiding souls, which might not be the most helpful skills in a professional setting. Additionally, Hermes' reputation as a trickster could lead to complications in a structured and regulated environment like UPS, where reliability and adherence to rules are crucial.

Both deities would need to adapt to the structured and regulated nature of a UPS job, which involves following specific procedures, adhering to schedules, and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job compared to a more fluid and less structured role like a messenger or courier."

Rhinoceroses have been poached for their horns, which are believed by some to have medicinal or aphrodisiac properties. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. The horns are made of keratin, the same protein found in human hair and nails, and do not have any sexual enhancement properties. The illegal trade in rhino horns has led to significant threats to rhino populations, contributing to their conservation status as endangered or critically endangered species."

"(A) No

Bruce Gandy, being a renowned countertenor, would be a highly suitable choice for performing in ""Messiah"" by George Frideric Handel. Countertenors are known for their ability to produce a high, clear voice that is well-suited for Baroque music, making them ideal for many of the roles in this oratorio. Therefore, Gandy would not be an odd choice for the performance."
"(A) Yes

"(A) Yes

The acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion can vary based on the cultural, religious, and social context. In many Christian communities, such imagery is widely accepted and even encouraged as a symbol of faith. However, in more secular or diverse settings, it may be seen as controversial or inappropriate. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific environment and audience when deciding to wear such an icon."

"(A) No

A celibate cleric is unlikely to suffer a stoning in Somalia unless they are specifically accused of a crime that would warrant such a punishment, such as adultery, and are in an area where Sharia law is strictly enforced. Cultural norms and practices vary widely across Somalia, and not all regions adhere to the same legal or religious standards. Therefore, without specific accusations and in areas where such punishments are not commonly applied, the risk is minimal."
"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden, which is located in Scandinavia. It plays a crucial role in the country's political system."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should be al dente, meaning it should have a slight firmness to it while still being fully cooked through.

If Christopher Reeve were poor, it is likely that his survival and quality of life would have been significantly impacted. The extensive medical care, specialized equipment, and support services he received were crucial to his management of the injury. Without these resources, his condition might have progressed differently, and his survival could have been compromised."
The answer is (B) No. A unanimously elected president's birthday is not typically designated as a break or holiday for mail carriers. Federal holidays are established by the U.S. government and are usually based on historical and cultural significance rather than individual officials' birthdays. Mail carriers generally do not have specific holidays designated for individual officials' birthdays.
"(A) No

Dyslexia is not the most common intellectual disability in the U.S. Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that affects reading abilities, whereas intellectual disabilities are characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.

"(A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password. A strong password typically requires a combination of different character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can contribute to the complexity of a password when used in combination with other character types. To ensure a password is strong, it should be at least 12-16 characters long, random, and not based on easily guessable information."
"(A) No

Observing a full circle of a rainbow is highly unlikely and not a practical activity, especially on a beach. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be seen when the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point, with the sun at a low angle (below 42 degrees). This rare alignment makes it difficult to spot a full circle of a rainbow simply by being on a beach. Therefore, lunch on the beach is not a good activity for spotting a full circle of a rainbow."
"(A) Yes

Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford had significantly different political affiliations. Gerald Ford was a Republican and served as the 38th President of the United States, while Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. Given their differing party affiliations and political stances, it is unlikely that they would have been on the same side on most political issues."
"(A) No

An explosion at a gunpowder storage facility would not result in a supersonic shock wave. The shock wave generated would typically be subsonic or just slightly supersonic, depending on the specific conditions of the explosion. The primary concern would be the release of energy and the potential for a blast wave that could cause significant damage and injury, but this wave would not exceed the speed of sound."
"(A) No

It's best to provide your cat with treats that are specifically formulated for feline consumption."
"The answer is (B) No.

Nine Inch Nails and Aretha Franklin represent distinct eras and genres in music.

The religions that consider the Himalayas to be sacred, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, have much older origins. Hinduism dates back to the Vedic period, around 1500 BCE, and Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE. Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(A) Yes

White rice does not go rancid in the same way that sesame seeds can. Rancidity is a process that typically affects foods containing significant amounts of fats and oils, such as sesame seeds. While white rice can spoil through other means, such as mold growth if it becomes damp, it does not undergo rancidity. Therefore, sesame seeds are more prone to going rancid than white rice."
"(B) No

Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are neurological conditions that affect how a person receives, processes, or conveys information, and they do not have a cure. Therefore, penicillin is not effective for treating learning disabilities."
"(B) No

Cancer does not directly cause excess adrenaline production. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is primarily produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. While certain tumors or conditions can affect the adrenal glands and lead to excess adrenaline production (a condition known as pheochromocytoma), this is not a direct result of cancer itself. Cancer can cause various hormonal imbalances and other physiological changes, but excess adrenaline production is not one of them."
"(A) No

Vellore Fort, located in Vellore, India, was primarily constructed to defend against external threats such as invasions and sieges. There is no historical evidence to suggest that grizzly bears, which are native to North America, ever posed a threat to the fort's occupants. Therefore, the occupants of Vellore Fort did not need to defend themselves from grizzly bears."
"(A) No

"A: Yes

A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500,000 MB, which is significantly larger than the approximately 3,600 MB (or 3.6 GB) needed to store 10 hours of Netflix content at high quality. Therefore, a 500GB USB device is more than sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
"(A) No

Jon Brower Minnoch's maximum recorded weight was 635 kg, while the launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 815 kg. Since 635 kg is less than 815 kg, Jon Brower Minnoch would not be able to break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch."
"A hedgehog would likely avoid animals without a spinal cord. Given that the spinal cord is crucial for movement, sensory processing, and overall survival, an animal without a spinal cord would be immobile and possibly unresponsive. This could trigger a natural avoidance response in a hedgehog, as it might perceive such an animal as a potential threat or something unfamiliar. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No

The iPhone, while a groundbreaking technological achievement, did not initiate a scientific revolution.

The iPhone, on the other hand, has primarily influenced the fields of consumer electronics, mobile technology, and communication."
"(B) No

Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language (ASL). While it can influence which hand is more dominant, it does not dictate the specific signs or the way they are performed. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to whether a person is right-handed or left-handed. Factors that can influence signing include individual style, context, and familiarity with ASL."

"(A) Yes

It is indeed normal for people to sing when the YMCA is mentioned. The song ""YMCA"" by the Village People has become culturally ingrained, often evoking spontaneous singing and hand movements, especially in fitness and exercise contexts."
"(A) No

The ""worst crash in history"" can refer to various incidents, but one of the most notable is the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989. While this crash was caused by a catastrophic engine failure, United Airlines was not blameless in other aviation disasters. For instance, the crash of United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977 was due to pilot error, and the airline was found to be at fault. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No

The Liberty Bell is not in its original location. It was originally located in the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. However, it was moved to a new pavilion on Independence Square in 1976 to better preserve and protect the bell. Today, the Liberty Bell is displayed in this specially constructed pavilion."
"(A) No

Using Oscars as bowling pins would not only disrupt the game but also be impractical and potentially dangerous."
"(A) No

A beaver's teeth and a Smilodon's teeth are quite different in both size and function. Beavers have strong, continuously growing incisors designed for cutting wood, while Smilodon had long, blade-like canine teeth for slicing through the flesh of their prey. Therefore, a beaver's teeth would not rival those of a Smilodon."
"(B) Yes, the rise of agriculture is often attributed to rivers because many early agricultural societies developed near river valleys. Rivers provided a reliable water source for irrigation, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and a means of transportation. These factors made river valleys ideal locations for the development of agriculture."
"(A) No

While art education is often included in the U.S. education system, it is not universally prioritized. Many schools offer art programs, but these can vary significantly in quality and availability depending on the region and local funding. Core subjects like math, reading, and science typically receive more emphasis due to standardized testing and college admissions requirements."
"(B) No

Kurt Cobain's death on April 5, 1994, was ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There is no credible evidence to suggest that Daniel LeFever, a former Nirvana roadie, was in any way responsible for or indirectly caused Cobain's death."
"(A) No

This answer is incorrect. Email as we know it today did not exist during Steven Spielberg's childhood. Email systems were developed much later, primarily in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and it wasn't until the 1990s that email became widely available to the general public. Therefore, Steven Spielberg, who was born in 1946, could not have sent emails as a child."
"(A) Yes

Theodor Seuss Geisel's use of the color green was a significant element in his distinctive artistic style, contributing to his fame. Green was a recurring color in his illustrations, particularly for characters and settings, helping to create a recognizable and beloved aesthetic in his books."
"(A) No

The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was constructed on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, during the 3rd century BC. While the project was overseen by Greek architects and engineers, it involved local Egyptian labor and materials. The design and construction techniques were influenced by Greek architectural principles, but the involvement of Greeks was part of the broader Hellenistic culture that had a significant impact on the region. Therefore, Greeks were not essential to crafting the Lighthouse of Alexandria; it was a collaborative effort involving both Greek expertise and local resources."
"(A) No

Keith Richards, the renowned guitarist of The Rolling Stones, has not played a role as a captain of a boat in any movie. While he has appeared in various films, including ""Crossfire Hurricane"" and ""The Lost City of Z,"" he has not taken on the role of a boat captain."

Preventive healthcare measures, such as regular STI testing, consistent use of barrier methods like condoms, and maintaining open communication with sexual partners, can significantly reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These practices help in early detection and treatment, thereby lowering the risk of spreading infections to others."
"(B) No

The story of Jesus, as presented in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is not considered to be directly inspired by Egyptian myths. While there are some parallels between certain elements of the Jesus narrative and various mythological or cultural traditions, these parallels are often seen as coincidental or the result of common human experiences and storytelling techniques. Many scholars argue that the development of the Christian narrative about Jesus was influenced by a variety of factors, including Jewish religious traditions, Greek and Roman philosophical ideas, and the cultural context of the early Christian communities. Therefore, the story of Jesus is not primarily or directly inspired by Egyptian myths."
"The answer is (B) No. Methuselah, as described in the Bible, is said to have lived for 969 years. In the Common Era, which begins on January 1, 1 CE, no human has reached such an age. The longest confirmed human lifespan on record is 122 years and 164 days, held by Jeanne Calment of France. Therefore, Methuselah would not hold a record in the Common Era."

"(B) Yes

To determine if Jason and Dr. Disrespect have anything in common, we need to consider their roles and backgrounds. Dr. Disrespect is a well-known figure in the esports and gaming community, known for his commentary and content creation. If Jason is also involved in esports or gaming, it is likely that they share common interests and fields. Therefore, they could have several things in common, such as a passion for gaming, similar audiences, or even collaborations."
"(B) No

Deaf people can certainly enjoy music through various means such as vibrations, visual representations of sound, and tactile experiences. Many deaf individuals participate in musical activities and appreciate music in unique ways that do not rely on hearing."
"(B) No

"(A) No

The Eiffel Tower was not used as a symbol of the French Revolution. The tower was constructed between 1887 and 1889 for the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and was named after its designer, Gustave Eiffel. The French Revolution, which took place from 1789 to 1799, predates the tower by nearly a century."
"The answer is (A) No.

The torso is not inherently protected by the largest or smallest bones in the body. While the ribcage, sternum, and spinal column provide significant protection, the largest bones (like the femur or pelvis) and the smallest bones (like those in the ear or phalanges of the fingers) do not directly shield the vital organs within the torso. Therefore, the torso can still be vulnerable to injuries from blows, regardless of the size of the bones involved."
"(B) Yes

Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu lived in the 14th century during the Ottoman Empire. Given the cultural and culinary traditions of the time, it is highly probable that he would have eaten börek, a traditional Turkish pastry. Therefore, the answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) No

King Kong was depicted climbing the Empire State Building, which stands at an elevation of about 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level. In contrast, the Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is also at an elevation of approximately 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level. Visitors to the Eiffel Tower can go up to the second and third levels, which are at higher altitudes than the ground level. Therefore, King Kong, even when climbing the Empire State Building, would not be at a higher altitude than visitors to the Eiffel Tower."
"(A) No

Dessert is generally consumed after a meal, often as a sweet treat at the end of a meal, and is not typically eaten before breakfast."
"(A) No

Disney's second film, ""Pinocchio"" (1940), does not directly rip off a prophet story. While the film includes themes of morality and transformation, these elements are drawn from Carlo Collodi's novel rather than a specific prophet story. ""Pinocchio"" tells the story of a wooden puppet who aspires to become a real boy through good deeds and moral choices. This narrative is more aligned with folk tales and fables rather than direct adaptations of prophet stories."

A chess board and a Shogi board differ in several key aspects. A chess board is 8x8 squares, whereas a Shogi board is 9x9 squares. Additionally, the rules and pieces used in each game are distinct. Chess has 16 pieces per side, including a king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns, while Shogi has 20 pieces per side, including a king, gold general, silver general, knight, lance, bishop, rook, and nine pawns. These differences make a direct conversion between the two boards impractical and not feasible."
"(B) No

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was fundamentally opposed to trickle-down economics. This economic theory, which advocates for reducing taxes and providing benefits to the wealthy in the belief that economic growth will eventually benefit everyone, is at odds with the socialist principles that the CPSU upheld.

"(A) No

Black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) are native to North America and are generally not afraid of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), as these two species do not naturally coexist.

The Statue of Liberty in New York, USA, is approximately 93 meters (305 feet) tall from the base of the pedestal to the tip of the torch, and the height from the ground to the statue's foot is about 46 meters (151 feet). The Lighthouse of Alexandria, an ancient lighthouse, is estimated to have been around 135 meters (440 feet) tall.

Given these measurements, the Statue of Unity is significantly taller than both the Statue of Liberty and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Therefore, it is not hypothetically more level with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria."

Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law in the late 19th century would not be considered fair by current standards. The legal and societal norms at that time were highly restrictive and punitive towards sexual behaviors that deviated from the norm. Wilde's conviction for ""gross indecency"" and subsequent imprisonment reflect the harsh and discriminatory laws of the era. Today, the U.S. has evolved significantly in its legal and social attitudes towards sexual orientation and gender identity, and such convictions would be seen as a violation of civil liberties and human rights."

As a result, celery was often used in funerary rites and ceremonies."
"(A) No

Paul the Apostle's cause of death, which is believed to have been execution by beheading, does not violate the tenets of Ahimsa. Ahimsa, a principle of non-violence central to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, primarily focuses on the ethical conduct of individuals during their lifetime. The manner of Paul's death, while tragic, does not directly reflect his actions or teachings. Therefore, it does not violate the principle of non-violence as understood in these religions."
"(A) No

While ""The Jungle Book"" was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time marked by colonialism and racial hierarchies, a careful analysis of the text reveals that it does not contain overtly racist subtext.

Instead, the focus is on themes of friendship, family, and the struggle between civilization and nature, which are universal and timeless.

Woodrow Wilson, as the 28th President of the United States, would not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. This Supreme Court case, decided in 1896, upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the ""separate but equal"" doctrine.

His actions and policies during his tenure suggest a stance that was more aligned with maintaining racial separation rather than supporting the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, which he would have seen as legitimizing and reinforcing racial segregation."

Their methods, loyalties, and interactions with other characters are quite different, making it inaccurate to say that Darth Vader's character closely resembles Severus Snape's."
"(A) No

In the United States, the legal age to drive varies by state, but it is generally 16 years old.

The modern Brazilian Navy, while highly advanced, would not have been able to turn the tide in the Battle of Actium. The battle took place in 31 BC and involved ancient naval tactics and technologies that are fundamentally different from those of today. The Roman warships used in the battle were rowed by oarsmen and lacked the advanced propulsion, armaments, and defensive capabilities of modern ships. Additionally, the strategic and political context of the battle, which heavily influenced its outcome, would not be replicable with modern naval forces. Therefore, the modern Brazilian Navy would not have the necessary historical context or technological means to alter the course of the Battle of Actium."
