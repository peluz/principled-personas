"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placements step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis
- House 2: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)
- House 3: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3. Given Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must be in House 3.

- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

Summarizing the placements:

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
3. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Therefore, the tea drinker is in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but the fifth house is already occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. This means the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but there are only five houses. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

    - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

From the above clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Apples (Clue 9)
- House 2: Pizza (Clue 12, since it must be next to mangos and cannot be in house 1)
- House 3: High heels (Clue 3)
- House 4: Mangos (Clue 12, since it must be next to pizza and cannot be in house 3)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is eating apples (house 1) cannot be the root beer lover, tea drinker, coffee drinker, or water drinker.
- The person who had pizza (house 2) cannot be the root beer lover, tea drinker, coffee drinker, or water drinker.
- The person who is eating mangos (house 4) cannot be the root beer lover, tea drinker, coffee drinker, or water drinker.

"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the clues, we can systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house (this is a contradiction with the first clue, but we'll assume it's the same person).
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 6, we know:

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, the sports, the fruits, and the flowers. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.

3. **Combining Clues 2 and 4**: Since the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges, and they are next to each other, the only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Swimmer
   - House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Person eating oranges

4. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Given the arrangement from Clue 4, the soccer player must be in house 1.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

6. **Assigning Sports and Fruits**:
   - House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
   - House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
   - House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

### Conclusion:
The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house. Let's break down the clues step by step:

7. **Clue 7:** The violinist lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Given that the violinist lives in the first house, we can start by placing the violinist in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second or third house. Given that the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. But the second house has the bouquet of daffodils, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a radio and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses.

- **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

Summarizing the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house:

1. **First House:** Violinist, ate spaghetti, mystery book reader, has a radio.
2. **Second House:** Daffodils, ate pizza, has a vase of tulips, has a phone.
3. **Third House:** Percussionist, ate fried rice, science fiction book fanatic, has a television, history book buff.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

- Since the history book buff lives directly left of the person with a bouquet of lilies, the history book buff must be in **House 1** and the bouquet of lilies must be in **House 2**.
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer, so the percussionist must be in **House 1** and the computer must be in **House 2**.
- The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, so the bird keeper must be in **House 2**.
- The fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1, so the fish enthusiast must be in **House 3**.
- The gameboy is directly left of the person with a rose bouquet, so the gameboy must be in **House 1** and the rose bouquet must be in **House 2**.
- The cellist does not live in the third house, so the cellist must be in **House 1**.

Now, let's summarize the current arrangement:

- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

This arrangement fits all the given clues. Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in **House 1**.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the known information step by step.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Radio
- House 2 or 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 1 or 4: Banana

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 4: Cat lover

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 13, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Fish
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Horses

From Clue 14, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

The person with the phone must be in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, and the history book buff lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 2.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct house number for each person based on their book preference and sport. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
     - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
     - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
     - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
     - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

4. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - This eliminates the possibility of the swimmer being in House 3, so the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as per Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their preferences step by step.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know that the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio. Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio (since the person in house 2 has a fish and likes yellow, as we will deduce).

Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.

3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.

14. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
16. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- The dog owner (2nd house) and the person who likes red (3rd house) are next to each other.
- The person who likes milk (1st house) and the person who likes blue (2nd house) are next to each other.
- The person who ate spaghetti (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who likes red (3rd house).
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice (4th or 5th house).
- The bird keeper (1st or 2nd house) and the fish enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) are one house apart.
- The root beer lover (2nd or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are next to each other.
- The fantasy book enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are next to each other.
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are two houses apart.
- The person who likes yellow (1st or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are two houses apart.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Given the clues and the layout of the houses, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who is eating kiwis.

1. The flutist lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist, so the fish enthusiast is in the second house and the cellist is in the third house.
4. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist, so the guitarist is in the second house.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives, so the person who is eating apples is in the third house and the person who is eating oranges is in the fourth house.
6. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other, so the person who owns horses is in the third house.
7. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house, which is consistent with the previous deduction.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis, so the person who only drinks water is in the third or fourth house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other, so the person who likes milk is in the third house.
10. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house, which is consistent.
11. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house, which is consistent.
12. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper is in the first house and the tea drinker is in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve the problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses, fruits, lunches, and flowers. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.

7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by organizing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics (houses, pets, and flowers) accordingly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3, and so on.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1 has a phone.
- House 2 does not have a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2 does not have boots.
- Therefore, House 1 must have boots.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other.
- Since House 1 has a phone, the person with a radio must live in House 2 (because they are next to each other).

So, we can summarize:
- House 1: Phone and boots.
- House 2: Horses and radio.

The only characteristic left for House 2 is high heels. Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the house number for each person based on their sport and pet. Let's use the given clues step by step:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the baseball player in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 1, the basketball player cannot be in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player must be to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 3, the baseball player is in the second house, so the swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Thus, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

From clue 5, the bird keeper cannot be in the first house. From clue 7, the bird keeper cannot be in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The question asks for the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives. According to the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to find the solution.

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Let's assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, let's consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the houses based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 2 and Clue 7:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house, and the person who likes milk also lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second or fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.
4. **Clue 5:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 8:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 10:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must be in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must be in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the first or second house. Given the root beer lover and the person who likes yellow, the person who drives a convertible must be in the first house.
8. **Clue 9:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the first house.
9. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must be in the second house.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must be in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.
11. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues and the constraints, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Kiwis

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

From clue 3, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house, the person in house 2 must be driving a truck.

From clue 1 and clue 2, since the person who drives a truck (house 2) and the person who owns an SUV (house 3) cannot be in the third house, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the problem step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - So, House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - So, House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
7. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Next, we use Clue 2 and Clue 3:

- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Using Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, using Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Using Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.

Given the clues:
1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the answer.

1. **House 1: Soccer player**
2. **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
3. **House 3: Kiwi eater**
4. **House 5: Not apples**
5. **House 5: Not flutist**
6. **House 2: Not apples**
7. **House 2: Not flutist**
8. **House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic**
9. **House 2: Not fried rice**
10. **House 2: Not stew**
11. **House 2: Not pizza**
12. **House 2: Not soccer player**

18. **House 2: Not cello**
19. **House 2: Not cello**
20. **House 2: Not cello**
21. **House 2: Not cello**
22. **House 2: Not cello**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- **House 2: Apples eater**

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues and the layout of the houses, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in house 4 owns an SUV.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 1"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the person who owns a sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player cannot be in House 3 (since the cat lover is there), so the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the person in House 2 would be the soccer player, and the person in House 3 would be the truck driver (since the cat lover is in House 3 and the basketball player is in House 1, the truck driver must be to the right of the basketball player).

Given these deductions, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Sedan and Cat lover

Since the basketball player must be in House 1 to satisfy all the clues, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
6. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
8. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
9. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
10. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
13. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
14. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
15. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

From Clue 1, we know the radio is in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the fourth house. Let's assume the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, making the rose bouquet in the first house.

From Clue 3, the bouquet of daffodils is not in the third house, which is consistent with our assumption.

From Clue 7, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the bouquet of daffodils, so the fish enthusiast is in the first house.

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV is in the second house.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the fish enthusiast is in the first house and the SUV is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the carnations arrangement in the fourth house.

From Clue 11, the bird keeper lives to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the carnations arrangement is in the fourth house, the bird keeper must be in the fifth house, and the person who drives a convertible in the third house.

From Clue 12, the bird keeper lives to the right of the person who drives a convertible, which is consistent.

From Clue 13, the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips must be in the third house.

From Clue 15, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement, which is consistent.

From Clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house, which is consistent.

From Clue 17, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist. Since the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but the SUV is already in the second house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

From Clue 18, the percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the cat lover must be in the fourth house, but the radio is already in the fourth house, so the percussionist must be in the fourth house, and the cat lover in the fifth house.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist. Since the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but the SUV is already in the second house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.

The answer is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses. Let's use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses. Since the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

2. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Tea drinker

3. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. But house 4 is occupied by the tea drinker, so the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - This is consistent with the previous deduction.

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - This means these two people are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1 and see how the other clues fit:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy

From Clues 3 and 4, we can conclude:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

Now, we need to determine the shoe type for the person in the second house:
- The person in the second house is not wearing loafers (since the first house person is wearing loafers).
- The person in the second house is not wearing sandals (since the first house person is wearing loafers, and loafers and sandals are the only two options left for the second house).

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2"
"To solve the logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the clues and the nature of the problem, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 3:** The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house, so the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).
3. **Clue 1:** The person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person with a radio must live in House 2, and the person eating apples must live in House 1.
4. **Clue 2:** The person with a radio lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

Therefore, the violinist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the house number for each person based on their sport and lunch choice. Let's use the given clues to fill in the information step by step:

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 3).

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the given information and use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses and their occupants.

We have:
- Two houses: House 1 and House 2.
- Each person has different characteristics:
  - Lunch: Stew or Spaghetti
  - Favorite color: White or Red
  - Drink: Water or Milk
  - Sport: Baseball or Swimming
  - Shoes: Running shoes or Loafers

Clues:
1. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person wearing running shoes lives in House 2.

From Clue 2, Clue 3, and Clue 4, we can deduce:
- The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.
- The person who ate spaghetti and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses.

Given that the person wearing running shoes is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- Since the person who ate spaghetti and the baseball player are adjacent, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1 (the only adjacent house to House 2).

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1, and the person who is wearing loafers is in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(B) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, people, fruits, and drinks.

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to determine the house number of the root beer lover.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and Clue 2 (revisited):** If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in either the first or the third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried Rice and Loafers

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | ?         | Stew      | Kiwis    | ?            | ?          |

"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader. Since the tennis player cannot live in the first house (clue 2), the tennis player must live in the second house. Therefore, the second house must be occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

1. **Clue 13**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Loafers

2. **Clue 12**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.

   - The only possible positions are:
     - House 1: Green
     - House 3: Pianist

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the known information:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the cellist in House 1 and then use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, we need to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes. According to Clue 5 and Clue 8, the basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red and to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, we need to place the flutist and the cricketer. According to Clue 7 and Clue 10, the flutist must be to the left of the person who likes yellow and to the right of the cricketer. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, we need to place the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, we need to place the person who likes yellow and milk. According to Clue 9, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 4 and the cricketer in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, we need to place the person who likes yellow and milk:

- If the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 4 (but House 4 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, we need to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker. According to Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

The correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The person who likes red lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) 1"

Now, let's use the clues to place the characteristics:

- **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
- **Clue 17:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house.
- **Clue 7:** The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 18:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper does not live in the fourth house, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in the first house, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is consistent with the other clues.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent with the other clues.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 13**: The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Pizza

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured format. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct placement of each characteristic.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if pizza is in House 2, blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if mangos are in House 2, red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if truck is in House 2, lilies are in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 2, red must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the two houses, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes, the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the positions of the people and their preferences step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses and their occupants step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know that the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement for them is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 3, the person who has a gameboy must be in the house to the left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the gameboy must be in House 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since House 2 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their pets and cars. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- The dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- Therefore, the truck owner (T) must live in house 4.

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Therefore, the sedan owner (S) must live in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must live to the right of the fish enthusiast (F):
- Therefore, the minivan owner (M) must live in house 3, but house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner (S).

Re-evaluating, we see that the minivan owner (M) must live in house 4, but house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner (T). Therefore, the minivan owner (M) must live in house 3, and the sedan owner (S) must live in house 4.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- Therefore, the cat lover (C) must live in house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast (F).

Re-evaluating again, we see that the cat lover (C) must live in house 4, but house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner (T). Therefore, the cat lover (C) must live in house 1, and the fish enthusiast (F) must live in house 2.

Thus, the dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues and the layout of the houses, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (Clue 5).
2. The root beer lover lives in the second house (Clue 3).
3. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk (Clue 2). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 1). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker, so the blue person must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (Clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step.

- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the person who likes blue is in the second house (Clue 6), the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

Since the cricketer is in house 4 and the tennis player is directly left of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 5. Therefore, the tennis player must be in house 4.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Given that the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house (Clue 7), we can start placing other characteristics based on the remaining clues.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5, with one house between them.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

From Clue 13, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be two houses apart. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.

"Given the clues and the constraints, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the person with the gameboy is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the house number for each person based on their car and device. Let's use the given clues step by step:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with the phone must be in House 2, and the person with the SUV must be in House 4.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4 (since House 4 is to the right of House 3).

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The computer cannot be in House 1.

Now, let's place the information we have:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone (since the SUV is in House 4 and the phone is directly left of the SUV)
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: SUV and Radio

From clue 5, the convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 2 or House 1. But House 2 is already taken by the phone, so the convertible must be in House 1.

- House 1: Minivan and Convertible
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: SUV and Radio

From clue 6, the computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

- House 1: Minivan and Convertible
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer
- House 4: SUV and Radio

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the people, flowers, and devices in the houses based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Vase of tulips

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Computer

3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by the computer, the phone must be in House 1 and the television in House 3.
   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Television

4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - Since the phone is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or House 5.
   - House 4 or House 5: Bouquet of lilies

5. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - The radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (since the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), so the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since House 1 is occupied by the phone and House 3 is occupied by the television, the radio must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Radio

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - Therefore, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5.
   - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The only remaining positions for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are House 4 and House 5.
   - Since House 5 is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, the rose bouquet must be in House 4 and the carnations arrangement in House 5.
   - House 4: Rose bouquet
   - House 5: Carnations arrangement

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the correct houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.

6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer (Clue 1) and Fish enthusiast (Clue 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing running shoes
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct houses. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce:
- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Since the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the golfer must have the bouquet of lilies and the basketball player must have eaten grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the basketball player in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (the soccer player's house).

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the basketball player in house 2 must have tulips.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips and ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils and ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics of the people in the houses based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can place:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- Clue 7: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 7).

Since the pianist is in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

- Clue 1: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
- Clue 6: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- Clue 10: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in house 3:

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Unknown
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Unknown

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who had stew must be in house 2.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Unknown

From clue 2, the person who ate stew (house 2) is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Unknown

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1 (clue 7), it must be in house 2 or 3. However, house 2 is already occupied by the person who had stew, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Water

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 3.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti, High heels
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Water

From clue 3, the root beer lover must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 3, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1.

- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti, High heels
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Water

From clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 3, which is already correct.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Since the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer, and the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person is a science fiction book fanatic and the other is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist

From clue 3, we know:
- House 2: Cannot be the person who likes white.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who owns horses cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner).

Given these points, we can deduce:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses (since the person who likes white cannot be in house 2 and the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2).
- House 2: Root beer lover (since the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner is in house 1).

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve the logic puzzle, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step.

1. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
2. **The person who had stew lives in the second house.**
3. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
4. **The violinist does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.**
6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Fried Rice
  - House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. Since the violinist cannot be in house 4, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

From clue 4, we know:
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house. Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 and must be to the right of the percussionist, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 2 or 3. But since the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, Violinist
- House 4: Pizza, History Book Buff

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, or the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (from Clue 7), and the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3), the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

The person who likes red must be in House 3 (since the person who likes red is next to the person who is wearing loafers, and the only remaining house is House 3).

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker

From Clue 1, since the water drinker is in House 1, the milk drinker must be in House 3 (one house to the right of the water drinker).

Now we have:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the lilies are in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the tulips must be in House 1 because the lilies are in House 2 and must be to the right of the tulips.

Now we have:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, which must be in House 3.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is:
(B) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the tennis player is in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues and the constraints, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the pizza eater cannot be in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the fried rice eater is to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house, confirming the history book buff is in the third house and ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the green lover must be in the second house because the green lover lives to the left of the history book buff, who is in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve the logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).
  - Clue 2: The golfer (house 3) is not in the second house.
  - Clue 3: The computer (house 1) and vase of tulips (house 2) are next to each other.

"To solve the problem, we need to deduce the house number for each characteristic based on the given clues. Let's organize the information step by step:

1. **The swimmer lives in the third house.**
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. **The violinist lives in the second house.**
   - Violinist: House 2

6. **The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

7. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. **The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

From Clue 1, the swimmer is in House 3.
From Clue 5, the violinist is in House 2.
From Clue 9, the cricketer is in House 4.
From Clue 11, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5.

Since the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other, and the basketball player is to the left of the guitarist, and the guitarist is to the right of the violinist (House 2), the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4. This is consistent with Clue 6.

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2
- Violinist: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the two houses, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Grilled cheese

Since each person has a different pet, and we know the fish enthusiast (House 2), the person in House 1 must be the dog owner.

Now, we need to determine what the person in House 1 ate for lunch. We know:
- House 1: High heels, Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the person in House 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in House 1 must have eaten stew (the only other option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clues 2, 4, and 6, we can conclude that the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. **Clue 9**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. **Clue 14**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
   - This aligns with the previous clue, confirming the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who has a radio does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 13**: The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 15**: The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Since the running shoes are in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

10. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
13. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
14. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
15. **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person who is wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house, which is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.

From Clue 12, the person who has a radio does not live in the second house, so the person who has a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics of each person in the correct house, following the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses: pizza, yellow, tea.
- **Clue 7 and Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover, pizza eater

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a structured format. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist is in the third house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, which satisfies this clue.

7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their devices, and their shoes. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the only house left for the person wearing loafers is the first house.

Now, let's assign the drinks based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the person in the first house cannot be the milk drinker. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
   - One person is a history book buff, and the other is a mystery book reader.
   - One person is wearing loafers, and the other is wearing high heels.

3. Clue 1 states that the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
4. Clue 2 states that the mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we can deduce that the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we can deduce that the mystery book reader must live in the first house because they cannot live in the second house.

Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by placing the items and people based on these clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. Since the person with running shoes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), the only possible positions are:
  - House 1: Running shoes, Rose bouquet
  - House 2: Running shoes, Rose bouquet

- From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

- From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals. This means:
  - If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

- From Clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the person with sandals. This means:
  - If the person with sandals is in House 3, the person with carnations is in House 2.
  - If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 3.

- From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew. This means:
  - If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
  - If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

- From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
  - If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
  - If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

- From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:
  - If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

- From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
  - If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
  - If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
  - If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the two houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the saxophonist cannot live in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From the above deductions, we can summarize the characteristics of each house:
- **House 1:** Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- **House 2:** Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the correct houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 14**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break it down step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured format. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 14**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 13**: The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
8. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
9. **Clue 6**: The person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.
10. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
11. **Clue 11**: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we need to fit these pairs into the remaining houses.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Using Clue 8, we place the person who only drinks water:

- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 5, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - From clue 1, the person who likes green is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3 (where the fantasy book enthusiast would be to the right), so the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3.

4. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
   - Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in House 3.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who owns horses is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.
   - Since House 2 has the vase of tulips, the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2.

7. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.
   - Since House 2 has the vase of tulips, the percussionist and the truck must be in House 1 and 2.

8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the cellist must be in House 1 or 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Carnations, Sedan, Blue
- House 2: Tulips, Bird Keeper, Yellow
- House 3: Rose Bouquet, Horses, Yellow

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people living in the houses, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist. Since the person in the first house likes green (from clue 3), we can summarize:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, cellist, likes green.

Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes red must be in house 2 (as per clue 3). The only remaining book type for house 2 is a mystery book. Therefore, the person in house 2 is a mystery book reader and likes red.

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the five houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues and the constraints of the problem, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - This means the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer lives in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer lives in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. However, the golfer is already in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses. Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses and their occupants.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Given these clues, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals. This scenario is consistent with all clues.

- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff. But this would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals. This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Now, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the two houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the person in house 1 is not the flutist, the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (and the flutist)

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured format. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
4. **Clue 6 (revisited):** The person with a rose bouquet is in the third house.
5. **Clue 8 (revisited):** The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, we have:
1. Daffodils
2. ?
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Since the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, let's use Clue 2:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the tennis player must be in the third or fourth house. Since the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet, the tennis player must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Tennis player

Finally, let's use Clue 5:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet and the fourth house is occupied by the tennis player, the golfer must be in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Golfer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Tennis player

Now, let's use Clue 7:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- This is already satisfied.

Finally, let's use Clue 9:
- There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Golfer
3. Romance book lover
4. Tennis player

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct house and food/colored combination for each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the information:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

We need to place the remaining items and colors. Let's start with the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the other constraints, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

Now, the person who likes blue must live in House 1 or 3. The person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who likes white must live in House 1, 2, or 3, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step.

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - House 1: History book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Wearing high heels.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the first house is wearing loafers, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The remaining characteristics for the second house are:
- Fish enthusiast
- Wearing high heels
- Has a cat

Thus, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person in the first house, who is a history book buff, a cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

   - Clue 14: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

5. **Flower Clues:**
   - Clue 1: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - Clue 4: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - Clue 13: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, the cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, the people, and their respective musical instruments and fruits. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the solution.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
This means the pianist and the kiwi-eater are in adjacent houses.

#### Clue 2: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

#### Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

#### Clue 4: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, we know the pianist and the kiwi-eater are adjacent, and the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart. This means the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house. Clue 2 tells us that the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first house.
- The pianist lives directly left of the cellist, which means the pianist must be in the first house and the cellist in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Carnations

2. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
   - House 4: Boots

3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips
   - House 5: Loafers

4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - House 1: Sandals

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - Possible positions: House 2 and House 3, or House 3 and House 4

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Daffodils

7. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes

Now, let's summarize the current arrangement:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels and boots. Since House 4 already has boots, House 3 must have high heels.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the individuals based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.
- **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the tea drinker.
- **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the house immediately to the left of the person who likes white.

Combining these clues, we get:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Person who likes white
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Person who only drinks water

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.
- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Tea drinker, Person who only drinks water
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, their occupants, and the flowers in their foyers. Let's break down the clues step by step:

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step by step:

1. **Clue Analysis:**
   - The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

2. **Assigning the Science Fiction Book Fanatic:**
   - Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, House 1 is confirmed to be the science fiction book fanatic's house.

3. **Determining the Coffee Drinker and Sandals:**
   - The coffee drinker must live to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - Since House 1 is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the only remaining option for the coffee drinker is House 1.
   - Therefore, the person in House 2 must be wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

Thus, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we can deduce:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 because it is to the left of house 2.
- Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist lives in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, people, their favorite colors, and the types of cars they own.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Convertible

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2, but house 2 already has the convertible. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
- Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 1 or house 2. But house 1 already has the person who likes yellow, so the person who likes white must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: White
- House 3: Sedan (with the convertible)

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice is in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast are in the same house (the second house), the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

Using clue 1:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic, who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic and the fantasy book enthusiast are already assigned, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's organize the information and use the given clues step by step.

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, this means:
- House 1: Grapes, House 2: Sandals
- or
- House 1: Sandals, House 2: Grapes

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in the left house (House 1) if the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in the left house (House 1) if the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

Combining these clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per Clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (since the only fruit left is kiwis).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues and logical deduction:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Given these clues, let's place the information step-by-step:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the positions for the violinist and the guitarist:
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4).
- There must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist (Clue 2).

This means the violinist and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3. However, since the cellist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist)

Thus, the guitarist must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct house number for the person who only drinks water. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4:
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5:
- There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From Clue 6 and Clue 8, we know:
- House 4 cannot have a radio, and it cannot have a computer. Therefore, it must have a phone.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3 must have grilled cheese, and House 4 must have pizza. Therefore, House 5 must have spaghetti.

From Clue 3, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese (House 3) and where the person who has a radio lives. Therefore, House 2 must have a radio.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since House 2 has a radio, the gameboy and computer must be in House 1 and House 2, or House 2 and House 3. But House 3 has grilled cheese, so the gameboy and computer must be in House 1 and House 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. Since House 2 has a radio, the gameboy and computer must be in House 1 and House 2. Therefore, House 1 must have the gameboy, and House 2 must have the computer. The person who ate fried rice must be in House 3 (grilled cheese) or House 5 (spaghetti). But House 3 has grilled cheese, so the person who ate fried rice must be in House 5.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone. Since House 4 has a phone, the television must be in House 1, House 2, or House 3. But House 1 has a gameboy, House 2 has a computer, and House 3 has grilled cheese, so the television must be in House 1.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice and Spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 3."

- House 5: Percussionist

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses and their occupants.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the bird keeper cannot live in house 1. Thus, the bird keeper must live in house 2.
- Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (as they must be to the right of the bird keeper).
- Therefore, the pizza eater must live in house 2 (since the grilled cheese eater is in house 1 and the bird keeper is in house 2).

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A). 

Here’s the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house (Clue 5).
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house (Clue 6).
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7).
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper (Clue 8).
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9).

From Clue 8, the soccer player must live in the first or second house since the bird keeper is in the third house. From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast must live in the first or second house as well, and they must be to the left of the soccer player.

Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8), so the soccer player must be in the first or second house. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house as well.

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so the baseball player must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan must be in the third or fourth house.

Given the constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.

10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Given that the cat lover lives in the first house, we can start by placing the cat lover in House 1.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the information:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

From Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can infer that the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3.

Using Clue 4:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

This means the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

Using Clue 1:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

Now, using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 2 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

The person who is eating grapes is in house 2, and the person who likes green is in house 1. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

- House 1: Oranges, Bird Keeper (since the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner, and the dog owner cannot be in House 3)
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible, Dog Owner (since the dog owner cannot be in House 3 and the bird keeper is in House 1)
- House 3: Horses, Truck

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
2. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
3. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
5. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
7. The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
9. There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
10. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the romance book lover:
- From Clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- From Clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first or last house.

Possible positions for the mystery book reader and the romance book lover are:
- Mystery book reader in house 1, Romance book lover in house 3.
- Mystery book reader in house 2, Romance book lover in house 4.

Let's try the first possibility:
- Mystery book reader in house 1, Romance book lover in house 3.

Now, let's place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- From Clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.

Possible positions for the percussionist and the guitarist are:
- Guitarrist in house 2, Percussionist in house 3, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Now, let's place the remaining people and their preferences:
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

Possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic, fantasy book enthusiast, and flutist are:
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1, Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2, Flutist in house 3.

This leaves the history book buff and the person who ate pizza and grilled cheese:
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
- From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.

Possible positions for the history book buff, the person who ate pizza, and the saxophonist are:
- History book buff in house 4, Person who ate pizza in house 5, Saxophonist in house 5.

The only remaining position is for the person who ate grilled cheese:
- Person who ate grilled cheese in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Person who ate grilled cheese
3. Guitarrist
4. History book buff
5. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.
7. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
8. The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. The person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
10. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover.
11. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
12. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
13. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
14. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
15. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.
16. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
17. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, the first house is the sedan. From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in the third house. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in the second house (since the romance book lover is in the third house).

Now, let's use Clue 16 and Clue 15:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.

This means:
- House 1: Sedan.
- House 2: Grapes.
- House 3: Romance book lover.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Green.

From Clue 11, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the mystery book reader must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. The SUV owner must be in House 1 (since the sedan is in House 1 and the SUV cannot be in House 2 or 3).

From Clue 14, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is the sedan, so the person who likes white must be in House 2.

From Clue 13, the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who is eating apples. Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 17, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3 and the person who is eating apples is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

From Clue 16, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."

    - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the phone must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3.

From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Guitarist
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the answer.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the two people who like root beer and the one who likes guitar must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses, pets, and flowers. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2: The dog owner does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - This means the dog owner cannot live in house 3 (because there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must live in house 1.
   - Consequently, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 1: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.**
   - Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

### Combining the Clues:
- The dog owner is in house 1.
- The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

Given these constraints:
- If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
- If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.

   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 3.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 4.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 4, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 1, 3, or 4: Wearing loafers

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1 or 2: Phone
   - House 2 or 3: Sandals

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1 or 2: Eating oranges
   - House 2 or 3: Computer

9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Bouquet of lilies

    - House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - House 1: Rose bouquet
    - House 2: Eating banana

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person with a banana is in House 2. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, fruits, and pets in each house. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangoes

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information and use the clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Mangoes
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues and the layout of the houses, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3), so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first or second house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

From clue 3 and clue 4, the person who is eating mangos cannot live in the first or third house, so they must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person who is eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this needs to be re-evaluated.

From clue 6, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first or fourth house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who is eating apples, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

So, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, we can systematically deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.

8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, which aligns with clue 7. This means the soccer player lives in the third house, and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{D}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, using Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, using Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, using Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information step by step. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, people, and their characteristics.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:
- The truck and gameboy must be adjacent.
- The minivan must be to the right of the truck.

From Clue 5, the minivan cannot be in house 1, so it must be in house 2 or 3. If the minivan is in house 2, the truck must be in house 1, and the gameboy in house 2. This would place the minivan next to the gameboy, satisfying Clue 2. From Clue 6, the flutist must be in house 1, directly left of the minivan.

Now, let's place the cellist and the high heels:
- The minivan and cellist are adjacent (Clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 2.
- The high heels and television are adjacent (Clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (Clue 7).

Given the flutist in house 1, the cellist in house 2, and the minivan in house 3, the only remaining house for the percussionist is house 3. The high heels and television must be adjacent, and since the cellist has the television, the percussionist must have the high heels.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The correct answer is (A) 4. According to the clues provided, the person eating apples lives in the fourth house."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, the flowers, the drinks, and the types of cars. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Now, we know:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan (house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 3).

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- Since the person who has a rose bouquet (house 1) likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes red does not live in the first house, so they must live in house 2 or 3.
- Since the person who ate spaghetti (house 2) likes red, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, people, and their characteristics step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given the above, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly tells us that the bird keeper is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns horses is in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in house \( n \), the person who had pizza is in house \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - The tea drinker is in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - The coffee drinker is in a house to the left of the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:

- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement.

1. **House 1:**
   - Vase of tulips
   - Spaghetti

2. **Clue 12 and 13:**
   - The first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 14:**
   - The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

4. **Clue 15:**
   - The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - Since the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. But since the first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti, the baseball player and tennis player cannot be in houses 1 and 2. Thus, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 7:**
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
   - This means the soccer player cannot be in house 4, and the lilies owner cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 8:**
   - The person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

    - The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.
    - This means the minivan driver must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

    - The person who drives a truck does not live in the second house.
    - This means the truck driver cannot be in house 2.

13. **Clue 5:**
    - The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 4, and the stew eater cannot be in house 1.

Given the constraints, let's start placing the known elements:

- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti
- House 2: (Baseball player, Tennis player, Minivan/Convertible)
- House 3: (Sedan/Truck, Lilies)
- House 4: (Soccer player, Cat lover, Stew, Truck/Minivan)

From Clue 6, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is to the left of the tennis player, the baseball player is in house 2 and the tennis player is in house 3.

From Clue 8, the minivan and convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From Clue 3, the sedan must be in house 3, and the truck in house 4.

From Clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 9, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 10, the rose bouquet must be in house 4.

From Clue 11, the stew eater must be in house 4.

From Clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2, so it must be in house 4.

From Clue 15, the soccer player must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 3, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- From Clue 1, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, if the person who is wearing boots is in house 1, the mystery book reader is in house 2.

This combination satisfies all the clues:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.
- House 2: Person who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader.

### Remaining Characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots) must be the one who drives a convertible (since the other person drives a truck).
- The person in house 2 (who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader) must like red, eat oranges, and wear running shoes.

    - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 5, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.
    - House 3: Mystery Book"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the houses while adhering to the provided clues. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues step by step.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues and logical deduction:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we can deduce that the second house cannot be occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist simultaneously. Therefore, we need to consider the characteristics of the people in the first and third houses.

Given that the violinist is in the second house, the basketball player must be in either the first or the third house. Let's place the cricketer in the first house. Since the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer (clue 1), the cellist must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

This leaves the basketball player to be in the first house, but since the cricketer is already in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house. This leaves the soccer player in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.**

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

   - Therefore, House 2 must have the vase of tulips.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). Since House 3 is already occupied by daffodils, the carnations arrangement must be in House 1.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The carnations arrangement is in House 1, so the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 or House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips

   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The romance book lover is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 2.
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2, and the root beer lover must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

"To solve this problem, let's organize the information step-by-step based on the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, we need to determine who is wearing running shoes. Since the cat lover is in House 1, the fish enthusiast must be in House 2 (wearing high heels), and the dog owner is in House 3, the only person left is the one in House 3, who is wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses. Let's use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

To determine if brown rock fish are found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis, we would need to consider the specific marine life in the region. Brown rock fish are typically associated with rocky coastal areas in the Atlantic and Pacific, but the Caribbean Sea, where Saint Kitts and Nevis are located, has different marine species. Therefore, it is unlikely that brown rock fish are found in these waters."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which can involve managing the environment to avoid bee activity.

Waltz and slam dance are both physical activities, but they differ significantly in terms of movement and risk. Waltz is a structured dance with smooth, controlled movements, while slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled actions. Both activities can be performed safely with proper training and precautions, but slam dance may have a higher potential for injury due to its more intense nature. Therefore, waltz is not necessarily less injurious than slam dance."

In the context of comparing fictional characters, it's important to consider the nature of their abilities. Apollo, from Greek mythology, is a god with divine powers, which would give him an advantage in a physical or magical confrontation. D'Artagnan, from ""The Three Musketeers,"" is a skilled human swordsman but lacks supernatural abilities. While D'Artagnan is highly skilled and brave, the sheer power and versatility of Apollo's divine abilities would likely give him an edge in a hypothetical battle. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a single Apollo would not be defeated by a single D'Artagnan, making the answer (A) No."
"(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Melanoma, the type of skin cancer he suffered from, is primarily associated with sun exposure. Sunscreen helps protect the skin from harmful UV rays, which can reduce the risk of developing skin cancers. Therefore, sunscreen is an important tool in preventing such conditions."

The French Defense, a common opening in chess, does not defend against a four-move checkmate. Fool's Mate, which occurs in just four moves (1.e4 e5 2.Qh5+), is a theoretical scenario that does not align with the typical progression of the French Defense (1.e4 e6). Therefore, the French Defense cannot protect against this specific checkmate."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is a disinfectant used in water treatment, but it must be properly managed to ensure it is safe for consumption.

Robert Wadlow, the tallest person ever recorded, stood at an impressive 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72 meters). In comparison, a German Shepherd dog typically ranges from 22.5 to 28 inches (57 to 71 cm) in height. Given this significant difference, Robert Wadlow would undoubtedly tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not beneficial to one's health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ethanol was beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the context and the material used. While certain pigments like lapis lazuli, historically used in ultramarine, have been extremely expensive, this does not make blue the most expensive color universally. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in specific applications. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(B) No

Paul Bunyan's immense size and strength, while impressive for clearing vast forests, would make him ill-suited for the intricate and detailed task of urban planning. Urban planning requires careful consideration of various factors such as infrastructure, zoning, and community needs, which would be challenging for someone with such a straightforward and potentially destructive approach. Therefore, Paul Bunyan would be a poor choice for an urban planner."
"(A) Yes

Parsley can be found in multiple sections of a grocery store because it is available both as fresh produce and as a dried spice. Fresh parsley is typically located in the produce section, while dried parsley is usually found in the spice aisle. This dual availability explains why you might find parsley in more than one section."

Alcatraz Island is significantly smaller than the area required to fit a standard football field. The island measures about 220 yards by 420 yards, while a full-sized football field is approximately 360 feet by 160 feet. Given these dimensions, it would not be possible to fit a football field on the island without overlapping or leaving large portions unused."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable ingredient for a White Russian cocktail. The flavors in a White Russian—vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream—are best left to their own unique taste profile. Adding kaffir lime would likely introduce an unwanted and disruptive flavor that doesn't complement the traditional components of the drink."
"(A) Yes

A Goblin shark, if hypothetically given limbs, could potentially ride a bike.

While cheaper cinnamon sticks might be harder or less aromatic, a spice grinder will still effectively break them down into smaller pieces, which can enhance their flavor in recipes."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery involve launching projectiles, they differ significantly in design, range, and usage. Artillery refers to large, powerful weapons used in military applications, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, a slingshot is a small, handheld device that uses elastic material to launch smaller projectiles over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

Factors that can influence signing include the signer's individual style, the context of the communication, and the signer's familiarity with ASL."

"To address the question about Pope Alexander VI's origin in the context of papal history, we need to consider the broader historical context of the papacy.

Pope Alexander VI, whose birth name was Rodrigo Borgia, was the first Spanish pope. While his origin was unique in the context of the papacy, it was not the least represented nationality. There were other non-Italian popes before him, such as Adrian IV (from England) and Clement V (from France).

Minor league baseball teams have not avoided naming their teams after weather phenomena. In fact, some teams have chosen names that are metaphorically related to weather or natural elements. For example, the ""Lake County Captains"" might reference the local lake, but it's not directly named after a weather phenomenon. Other teams might use names like ""Rafters,"" which could be a metaphor for being carried by a river's current, again not directly related to weather. Therefore, weather phenomena have not been entirely avoided in naming minor league baseball teams."

"(B) No

Professional boxers are at a high risk of dental injuries due to the physical nature of their sport. They often experience impacts to the face and mouth during matches and training, which can lead to broken teeth, gum injuries, and other dental issues.

While protective gear can help minimize the risk, it does not eliminate the need for dental care. Therefore, professional boxers cannot expect to have low dental bills."

Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider whether he would be recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church."

If such allegations were to arise, they would likely be significant news and widely reported."
"(B) No

The NY Stock Exchange closing bell is a local event and its sound is confined to the physical location in New York City.

"(A) No

While ""The Jungle Book"" contains elements that reflect the cultural and historical context of its time, it is important to note that the story has been reinterpreted and adapted in various ways over the years. Modern analyses often focus on the universal themes of friendship, family, and personal growth rather than the potential racial subtext. Additionally, the 1967 Disney animated film and subsequent adaptations have been recontextualized to be more inclusive and less problematic. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that the story does not contain racist subtext in its modern interpretations."
"(A) No

In the 1980s, China's one-child policy limited most urban families to having only one child.

King Manuel I of Portugal was born in 1469 and reigned from 1495 to 1521. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled England from 1485 to 1603, had no direct familial connections to Manuel I. The Tudors were a separate royal lineage with origins in England, and there is no historical record of any familial ties between Manuel I and the Tudor monarchs.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The theft aspect doesn't impact his ability to box in a different country."

Woodrow Wilson would likely not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. As an expert in Sudoku, my knowledge of historical figures and their views is limited, but it is known that Wilson was generally not a proponent of racial equality. His actions, such as the segregation of federal agencies during his presidency, indicate a stance that was at odds with the principles upheld in Plessy v. Ferguson. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that he would not have supported this decision."

Their methods, loyalties, and interactions with other characters are distinct, making it inaccurate to say that Darth Vader's character closely resembles Severus Snape's."
