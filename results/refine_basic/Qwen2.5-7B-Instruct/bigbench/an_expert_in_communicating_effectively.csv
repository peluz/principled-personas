"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. Therefore, the percussionist must live in House 3.

- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover must be in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

Summarizing the placements:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the positions.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
The tea drinker lives in house number (A) 2.
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house (which contradicts the first clue, but we'll assume the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese).
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can arrange the information as follows:
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 2 and 4 are left to be filled with pizza, root beer, stew, and milk.

Since the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other, the only logical arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

To verify this, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The bird keeper must be in House 2 (since they cannot be in House 1 or House 3).
- The mystery book reader is in House 2.
- The history book buff must be in House 1, and the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.
- The percussionist must be in House 1, and the computer must be in House 2.
- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since they cannot be in House 1).
- The gameboy must be in House 1, and the rose bouquet must be in House 2.

Thus, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Radio
- House 3 or 4: Carnations

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 1 or 4: Banana

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 4: Cat lover

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 13, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we need to place the devices and pets.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as per Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a gameboy, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person based on their favorite color, drink, and book preference.

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the white person and the coffee drinker must be in positions that are two houses apart.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - The coffee drinker cannot be in the first or second house if the green person is in the first or second house, respectively.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - The romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - The root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - The person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - The romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - The tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- The root beer lover (red) is in house 3.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Now, we need to place the white person and the coffee drinker:

- The white person and the coffee drinker must be two houses apart.
- The coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green.

If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house for the cat lover:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Green, Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Radio, Fish enthusiast, Pizza

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, the person in house 1 must like green and be a fantasy book enthusiast. The person in house 2 has a radio and likes yellow (since the fish enthusiast likes yellow).

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

15. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
16. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The dog owner (2nd house) and the person who likes red (3rd house) are next to each other.
- The person who likes milk (1st house) and the person who likes blue (2nd house) are next to each other.
- The person who ate spaghetti (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who likes red (3rd house).
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice (4th or 5th house).
- The bird keeper (1st or 2nd house) and the fish enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) are one house apart.
- The root beer lover (2nd or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are next to each other.

- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are two houses apart.
- The person who likes yellow (1st or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are two houses apart.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the 4th house.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To determine the house where the person who had stew lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples. From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis. From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the bird keeper:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Starting with the baseball player in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Given the basketball player is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The correct answer is (E) 1. According to the clues provided, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person living in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - So, House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - So, House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Next, we use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Using Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, using Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Using Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the answer.

15. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
16. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the fourth house.
17. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player (clue 1)
- House 3: Kiwi eater (clue 13)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer, clue 2)
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the stew eater must be in House 5.

- House 5: Stew eater

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 5: Stew eater

The remaining characteristics are:

- House 1: Soccer player

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

(B) 1"
"The basketball player lives in House 1.

To break down the reasoning:
1. The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1) based on Clue 2.
2. From Clue 4, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. Clue 3 states that the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.
4. Clue 1 indicates that the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Given the arrangement so far, the basketball player must be in House 1, the soccer player in House 2, and the truck driver in House 3.

From Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, the vase of tulips must be in the third or fifth house, and the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house. Since the vase of tulips is to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, and the bouquet of daffodils is not in the third house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, the rose bouquet is in the first house, and the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house. Therefore, the vase of tulips must be in the third house.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The answer is \boxed{3}."
"The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The cellist lives in house 2.

To arrive at this conclusion, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Tea drinker

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. Given that the tea drinker is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who had pizza is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this clue is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

Thus, the cellist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Here is the refined approach:

1. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the minivan is in house 4.

2. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

3. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies. Since the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.

5. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - This means the daffodils must be in house 1.

6. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.

7. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker must be in house 4.

8. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the swimmer and the sedan owner are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

9. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - This is already satisfied by the previous placement.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the information step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct answer:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Fantasy book enthusiast: House 3

2. **Clue 1:** The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - History book buff: House 2

   - Science fiction book fanatic: House 4

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - Boots: House 4 (since apples are in House 2 and there is one house between them)

Now, let's summarize the positions:
- House 1: Eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana, wearing boots, science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above deductions:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist is wearing loafers.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4**: The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the person who only drinks water. Since they do not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, we use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The correct answer is:

(C) 3"

- House 3: Yellow

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: High heels

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 5: Grilled cheese

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 4: Blue

From Clue 5, we know:

From Clue 6, we know:
- Boots cannot be in House 3.

From Clue 7, we know:
- Stew lives to the right of white, so white must be in House 1, 2, or 3, and stew must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

- Fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person with a phone.

From Clue 9, we know:

- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Given the constraints, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4, as it fits all the conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"The person with the television lives in the first house, according to the given clues. Since the person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house, they must live in the second house. Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the second house.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the possible arrangements based on the clues:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"
"To determine the house number where the percussionist lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

   - Possible pairs: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

10. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From Clue 10, the bird keeper is in house 5, so the bird keeper cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in house 5, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. But house 4 is occupied by the violinist, so they must be in houses 3 and 2.

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Person who owns horses

From Clue 4, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. The only possible pair is (2, 3), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the flutist and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Person who owns horses
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

From Clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. The only possible pair is (2, 3), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person with a television and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 3 and 4.

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Violinist

From Clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. The only possible pair is (1, 2), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the guitarist and the percussionist must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Person who owns horses
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The basketball player does not live in the first house, so the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).
3. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples, which means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.
4. The person with a radio also lives to the right of the violinist, so the violinist must live in House 1.

Therefore, the violinist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their sport and lunch choice.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 3).

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti are (1, 3) or (2, 4). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6:
- Stew is left of spaghetti, so Stew: House 1, Spaghetti: House 3.

From clue 5:
- Pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

Given Clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

To break down the reasoning:

1. **Clue 3** states that the root beer lover does not live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.
2. **Clue 2** indicates that the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover were in the first house, the water drinker would have to be in the third house. However, this would place the coffee drinker and the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts **Clue 4** (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house).
3. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in the third house. This means the water drinker is in the second house.
4. With the root beer lover in the third house and the water drinker in the second house, the coffee drinker and the mango eater must be in the first house. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with **Clue 1**.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house number 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - House 3: Bouquet of lilies
   - House 2: Guitarist

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

   - House 1: Pizza
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils

6. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since House 1 and House 2 are already occupied, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 or 3.
   - House 1: Pizza
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Stew

   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Stew
   - House 4: Spaghetti
   - The person who likes white must be in House 3 or 4.
   - Since House 3 is occupied by stew, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

8. **Clue 9**: There are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.
   - The person who likes green must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct placements step by step.

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"

Now, let's use the clues to place the characteristics:

- **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
- **Clue 17:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house.
- **Clue 7:** The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 18:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the cricketer:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the kiwi eater lives in the first house.

From clue 5, since the dog owner does not live in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Given that the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the apple eater must be in the first house.

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who likes white:

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Given that the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

- Therefore, the truck owner (T) must live in house 4.

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- This means the sedan owner (S) must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must live to the right of the fish enthusiast (F):
- Therefore, the minivan owner (M) must live in house 3, but house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner (S).

Re-evaluating, we find:
- The minivan owner (M) must live in house 4, but house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner (T).

Re-evaluating again:
- The minivan owner (M) must live in house 3, and the sedan owner (S) must live in house 4.

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- Therefore, the cat lover (C) must live in house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast (F).

Re-evaluating:
- The cat lover (C) must live in house 3, and the minivan owner (M) must live in house 4.

Thus, the dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (Clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

But the first house is occupied by the phone, and the second house is occupied by the computer, so the radio must be in the third house. This means the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fourth or fifth house.
6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the fifth house is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, the rose bouquet must be in the fourth house, and the carnations arrangement must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer (Clue 1) and Fish enthusiast (Clue 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1.

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**

- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the sandals owner are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2, with the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**

2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).
  - Clue 2: The golfer (house 3) is not in the second house.
  - Clue 3: The computer (house 1) and vase of tulips (house 2) are next to each other.
  - Clue 4: The radio (house 3) is to the right of the rose bouquet (house 1).

"To determine the house number where the person who is wearing sandals lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. The violinist lives in the second house.
6. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
9. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

From Clue 11, the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 9, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the cricketer.

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the basketball player and the baseball player must be in the third and second houses, respectively. However, the third house is occupied by the swimmer (Clue 1). Therefore, the basketball player must be in the second house and the baseball player in the first house.

From Clue 5, the violinist lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the violinist.

From Clue 6, the basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the guitarist must be in the third house. But the third house is occupied by the swimmer. Therefore, the guitarist must be in the fourth house, and the basketball player in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in the fourth house, the person with carnations must be in the fifth house, but the fifth house is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the person with carnations must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist is in the fourth house, the person with sandals must be in the third house, and the person with a vase of tulips in the fourth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the cricketer. Therefore, the person with sandals must be in the second house, and the person with a vase of tulips in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the fifth house, the person with running shoes must be in the fourth house, but the fourth house is occupied by the cricketer. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in the third house, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in the fifth house.

From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in the fifth house (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in the second house, the person with high heels must be in the first house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in the third house.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in the first house (high heels) or the second house (sandals), the percussionist must be in the fifth house, and the person with loafers in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives. Since the person with sandals is in the second house, the cellist must be in the fifth house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1, we can conclude:
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast

From Clue 2, we can conclude:
- House 2: Grilled cheese

Since each person has a different pet, and we know the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner.

Now, we need to determine what the person in house 1 ate for lunch. We know:
- House 1: High heels, Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must have eaten stew (the only other option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

- Clue 13: The person who owns horses lives in the second house, which is already satisfied.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Fantasy book enthusiast

- House 4: White, Blue, Bird keeper, Red
- House 5: Romance book lover

"The person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses: pizza, yellow, tea.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses: orange, apple.

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce the sequence: pizza, yellow, tea.

From Clue 7, we know the sequence: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist is in the third house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.
5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.
6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots, Radio
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The remaining devices are the phone and the gameboy. Since House 3 is already assigned to Sandals, the phone must be in House 3.

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 2 and Clue 10, we know:
- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover next to each other. Let's consider the possible positions for these pairs.

From Clue 13 and Clue 7, we know:
- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
- Percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 6, we know:
- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know:
- Violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- Violinist does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, we know:
- Romance book lover does not live in the third house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1, and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist.

From clue 3, since the first house is to the left of the second house, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person in the second house must be the mystery book reader (since the only remaining book type is mystery) and likes red.

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3 or 4. Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2 and the person who is wearing loafers in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer:

1. The golfer lives in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 3).

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. However, the golfer is already in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1, as there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic (who is in house 3).

Thus, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

From Clue 2, we know the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff.

Now, using Clue 1:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and owns horses.

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Wearing sandals, owns horses, ate spaghetti, and is a history book buff.
- House 2: Owns horses, is a history book buff, and ate fried rice.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Using **Clue 4**:

9. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue are three houses apart.

10. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
    - This means the person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of House 3.

11. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

12. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

13. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and use a step-by-step approach to deduce the correct house and food/colored combination for each person.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the clues, let's deduce the positions:

- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the other clues, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

Now, we need to place the remaining people and foods:

- The person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes blue can live in House 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti can live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must live to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white can live in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Given the constraints, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"The basketball player lives in house number 3.

To break down the reasoning:
1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The percussionist lives in the second house (Clue 5).
3. The violinist must live to the right of the basketball player (Clue 1), and since the percussionist is in the second house, the violinist cannot be there. Therefore, the violinist must be in the first house.
4. The basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player (Clue 3). Given the percussionist is in the second house, the only remaining option for the basketball player is the third house.
5. The person who likes yellow cannot live in the second house (Clue 4), so the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in house number 3."

16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in House 5.

From Clue 17, there is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

By analyzing the clues and the possible positions, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the truck must be in House 3, and the convertible must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Here are the clues and their implications:

1. The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person with the carnations arrangement in the fifth house (Clue 7):

- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in House 4:

- House 4: Boots
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already occupied by boots, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5:

- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 3, the person wearing sandals cannot be in House 5, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person wearing sandals must be in House 1:

- House 1: Sandals

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since House 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied, the only possible positions are:

- House 2: Running Shoes
- House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

From Clue 5, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Since House 4 is already occupied by the vase of tulips, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2:

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 8, the person with the bouquet of daffodils (House 2) and the person wearing running shoes (House 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 6, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) does not live in the fourth house, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Finally, the only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3:

- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
9. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and the person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red (since white and green are already taken)
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.

3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

- The houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right).

Since the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in House 1, and the person with a television must be in House 2.

Therefore, the arrangement is:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes.

Thus, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Given these clues, let's test the possible arrangements:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who only drinks water lives in house number 4.

To break down the reasoning:
1. The person wearing sandals lives in the third house (Clue 1 and Clue 7).
2. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 3), so the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
3. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house (Clue 4).
4. The person wearing boots lives in the fifth house (since the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person wearing boots, Clue 6).
5. The coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses, with the coffee drinker in the first house and the person wearing loafers in the second house (since the third house is occupied by the person wearing sandals and the third house is also where the person who likes milk lives, Clue 5).

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 4."

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From Clue 1:
- The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

Since House 2 is occupied by the radio, the only possible pair is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 4:
- There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
- House 5: Spaghetti
- House 4: Pizza
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Computer
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 4 and House 5 are not possible for fried rice, so:
- House 3: Fried rice

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 2:
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
- The only remaining devices are television and phone.

- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.

5. **Clue 12**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the baseball player must be in house 5 and the tennis player in house 4.

Now, the positions are:

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the percussionist cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first house.
- The bird keeper cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must live to the right of the bird keeper, which means they live in the second house.
- Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A). 

Here’s the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).

- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9), so they are in the first or second house.
- The person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house (Clues 4 and 6), so they are in the second or fourth house.
- The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7), so the baseball player is in the first or second house, and the sedan owner is in the third or fourth house.

Combining all these constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Given that the cat lover lives in the first house, we can start by placing the cat lover in House 1.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the information:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

Using Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can deduce:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 2 is occupied by grapes, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green must be to the left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore:
- House 1: Green
- House 3: Red

From Clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Therefore:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 3: Red

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since House 1 is occupied by kiwis and House 3 by red, the only possible positions for white and banana are houses 2 and 4.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. Since House 3 is occupied by red, the only possible position for white is House 2, and for banana is House 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

12. **Clue 6**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
    - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the phone must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 1: Not Green, Not Radio
- House 2: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 4: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 5: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3. From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

From Clue 2, we know the dog owner cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the dog owner must be in either house 1 or house 3.

From Clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3, as there is no house to the right of house 3. Thus, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Given that the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in either house 2 or house 3. From Clue 1, the person with the carnations arrangement must be to the right of the bird keeper. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

This leaves the person with the vase of tulips in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

- House 4: Swimmer

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"The romance book lover lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Starting with Clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Using Clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Using Clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, using Clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:
- The truck and gameboy must be adjacent.
- The minivan must be to the right of the truck.

From Clue 5, the minivan cannot be in the first house, so the truck must be in the first house, the gameboy in the second house, and the minivan in the third house.

Now, from Clue 3, the minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in the second house.

From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the minivan, so the flutist must be in the first house.

From Clue 4, the high heels and television are adjacent, and from Clue 7, the boots are to the right of the percussionist. Since the flutist is in the first house and the cellist is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
The correct answer is (A) 4. The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.
"The coffee drinker lives in House 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given these clues, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in house 2.

To arrive at this conclusion, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The bird keeper lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.

7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
8. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Bird keeper.

From clue 9, since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

From clue 10, the person who owns horses lives in house 4.

From clue 4, the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet are 2 houses apart. Given the positions of the bird keeper and the person who ate spaghetti, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater.
- House 2: Bird keeper.
- House 3: Violinist (since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3).
- House 4: Horse owner.

From clue 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 2, directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist. Given the positions of the violinist and the horse owner, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips.
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper.
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet.
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, the saxophonist must be in house 4, and the guitarist in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

- **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
  - Since green must be to the left of blue, and considering the other clues, green must be in House 1 and blue in House 2.

- **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
  - Oranges are in House 2, so green must be in House 1.

- **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 4), (2, 5)
  - Since green is in House 1 and blue in House 2, yellow must be in House 2 and romance book lover in House 4.

- **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
  - Fantasy book enthusiast is in House 5, so saxophonist must be in House 4.

- **Clue 8**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
  - Since yellow is in House 2 and high heels in House 4, white must be in House 1 and banana in House 3.

- **Clue 9**: The person who is eating oranges and the person who is wearing loafers live directly next to each other.
  - Oranges are in House 2, so loafers must be in House 3.

- **Clue 10**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
  - Grapes must be in House 3, so history book buff must be in House 5.

- **Clue 11**: The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - Yellow is in House 2, and high heels in House 4.

- **Clue 14**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

- **Clue 16**: The science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other.
  - Science fiction book fanatic and cellist must be in (2, 3).

From the above deductions, we can conclude:

- House 1: Running shoes, likes white
- House 2: Oranges, likes yellow
- House 3: Bananas, likes green
- House 4: Apples, likes blue, mystery book reader, saxophonist
- House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast, likes red, history book buff, percussionist, science fiction book fanatic, cellist

The number of the house where the romance book lover lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of the people in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the violinist and the basketball player cannot both live in the second house, and clue 1 states that the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, the cricketer must live in the first house.
- The cellist, therefore, must live in the third house.
- This leaves the second house for the violinist and the basketball player. Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the violinist must live in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

The basketball player, who is not the violinist, must live in the third house. This leaves the first house for the soccer player.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.

- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1. 

The correct answer is (A) 1."

4. **House 4:** The person eating banana lives here, and they own an SUV.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 4, we know the soccer player is in house 2. Since the romance book lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), and the soccer player is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The swimmer lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.

"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only remaining shoe type is running shoes, which must be worn by the person in House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"(A) No

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular, and often jerky movements. These symptoms would make it extremely challenging for a person to perform the precise and controlled movements required in a ballet competition. Therefore, someone with St. Vitus's Dance is unlikely to win a ballet competition."
"(A) No

Pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use human languages like Pig Latin. This language game is designed for humans and requires an understanding of linguistic rules that animals do not possess. Pigs communicate through a variety of sounds, body language, and other forms of non-verbal communication."

"(A) No

The 1936 Summer Olympics venue, the Olympiastadion Berlin, had a seating capacity of around 100,000 spectators. While this might seem large, the Super Bowl typically attracts a much larger audience, both in terms of stadium attendance and television viewership. Modern Super Bowl venues can hold between 60,000 to 80,000 people, but the overall crowd size, including additional viewing areas and television viewers, far exceeds the capacity of the 1936 venue. Therefore, the Olympiastadion Berlin would not be sufficient for a Super Bowl crowd."
"(A) No

"(A) No

Waltz and slam dance both have their own unique characteristics and risks. Waltz is a more structured and controlled dance form, while slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled movements. However, the likelihood of injury does not solely depend on the dance style but also on factors such as skill level, environment, and specific movements performed. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that waltz is less injurious than slam dance. Both dances can be performed safely with proper precautions and training."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny, which contains a small amount of silver but also significant amounts of copper and manganese, would not be suitable for making silverware.

Not all cucumbers have the same texture. Different varieties can result in varying levels of firmness and crispness. Additionally, factors such as ripeness and preparation methods can further affect the texture."
"(A) Yes

""Rick and Morty"" contains mature themes and content that could be triggering for children of alcoholics or anyone dealing with the effects of alcoholism. The show includes dark humor, complex moral and ethical dilemmas, and sometimes disturbing or violent scenes. Given these elements, it's important for parents or guardians to consider the appropriateness of the show for children, especially those who may be more sensitive due to personal or family experiences with substance abuse."
"(A) No

Simon Cowell is not eligible to vote for the next Supreme Court judge.

"(A) No

In a hypothetical scenario comparing Apollo from Greek mythology and D'Artagnan from ""The Three Musketeers,"" Apollo's divine attributes and powers would likely give him an advantage over a single D'Artagnan. However, if we consider multiple D'Artagnan figures, the outcome could be more complex and might favor the D'Artagnans due to their collective bravery and skill. Nonetheless, for a direct comparison between a single Apollo and a single D'Artagnan, Apollo's divine abilities would make it unlikely for D'Artagnan to defeat him."
"The correct answer is:

(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Melanoma, the type of skin cancer he developed, is linked to UV radiation from the sun. Sunscreen helps protect the skin from this radiation, making it an important tool in preventing skin cancers."

The French Defense, characterized by the moves 1.e4 e6, does not defend against a four-move checkmate. Fool's Mate, which occurs in a few moves at the start of the game, is a different scenario and does not involve the typical opening moves of the French Defense."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not guaranteed to be safe for drinking. Chlorine is used to disinfect water, but it needs to be properly managed to ensure it is safe. The water should be allowed sufficient time to off-gas and decay, ensuring that harmful levels of chlorine are reduced to safe levels. Without proper treatment and sufficient time, the water may still contain unsafe levels of chlorine, which can be toxic and harmful to health."
"(B) No

A dichromat, or someone with color vision deficiency, would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color, as both gases are colorless. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yes

Elizabeth I ruled from 1558 to 1603, and ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was likely written and performed around 1587. Given this timeline, it is plausible that Elizabeth I could have seen the play during her reign. However, there is no definitive evidence confirming that she did see it."
"(B) No

While you can take steps to minimize interactions with trolls, it's challenging to completely avoid them on Reddit. Trolls are often drawn to conflict and can appear in various threads. However, you can protect your experience by setting clear boundaries, not engaging with trolls, reporting abusive content, and using privacy settings to control who can contact you."
"(A) No

Sea turtles in the wild continue to face numerous challenges such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change, which are not alleviated by human quarantine measures. While sea turtles in captivity or protected areas might have a more controlled environment, the broader context of their natural habitats remains challenging. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine in the same way humans might."
"The answer is (B) No.

Jesus lived in a time and cultural context very different from our modern era. The Easter Bunny is a relatively recent addition to Easter celebrations, originating in Germanic and later German-American traditions. Given that Jesus lived around 2,000 years ago, he would not have been familiar with the concept of the Easter Bunny. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny."
"(A) No

An elephant would not easily defeat a male macaque. Despite the significant size and strength difference, a macaque would likely use its agility and natural instincts to avoid or minimize direct conflict with an elephant."
"(A) No

Therefore, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not considered beneficial to health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely had more negative than positive effects on his health, contributing to various issues such as liver problems."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the specific pigment, material, and application. For instance, certain rare pigments like lapis lazuli, historically used in ultramarine, have been extremely expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can also be very costly in specific applications. Therefore, the claim that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, while an extremely strong athlete, would not throw a Bengal fox with ease. The act of throwing a small animal like a fox is not within the scope of his athletic focus and would not be performed with the necessary control and safety."
"(B) Yes

"(A) No

Both The Jackson 5 and The Isley Brothers were family bands, but The Isley Brothers originally consisted of five members (O'Kelly Isley, Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley, Vernon Isley, and Odessa Isley). While The Jackson 5 had five members as well, the term ""bigger family band"" is subjective and can be interpreted based on the number of family members involved. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that one was definitively bigger than the other."
"(A) Yes

Lactobacillus is not strictly necessary for making pickles, but it can enhance the process. The natural lactobacillus present on vegetables or in the environment can ferment the sugars, creating lactic acid and contributing to the pickles' flavor and preservation. Adding a lactobacillus starter culture can ensure a more controlled and consistent fermentation, leading to better-tasting and more safely preserved pickles."
"(A) No

Shooting a bald eagle can result in severe legal penalties, including significant prison time. As a protected species under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, violations can lead to fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. In comparison, Michael Vick's sentence for his dogfighting conviction was 23 months. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the penalties for shooting a bald eagle can indeed be more severe."
"(B) No

Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, well before the invention of television. The show Bonanza first aired in 1959, making it impossible for Gandhi to have watched it."
"(A) No

Given the significant differences in their beliefs and backgrounds, it is unlikely that Jacques Duèze and Richard Dawkins would have been friends. Duèze was a Roman Catholic priest with conservative views, while Dawkins is known for his atheism and advocacy of scientific explanations. Their fundamental differences in worldview would likely create a barrier to friendship."
"(B) No

Hiding a pet macaque under a desk is not recommended. Macaques are non-domesticated primates that require specific living conditions, including adequate space, social interaction, and environmental enrichment. Keeping a macaque in such a confined space is not only illegal in many areas but also extremely harmful to the animal's well-being. Therefore, it is not advisable to hide a pet macaque under a desk."
"(B) No

Justin Bieber is a renowned singer and does not have any political aspirations that would involve taking over Mike Pence's position. Mike Pence served as the Vice President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. There were no plans for Justin Bieber to run for or assume this role in 2020."

Paul Bunyan, known for his enormous size and strength, would likely struggle with the intricate and nuanced tasks required in urban planning. His methods, which are more suited to clearing vast forests, would be unsuitable for the careful and detailed work needed to develop and manage urban areas. Therefore, he would be a poor choice for an urban planner."
"(A) Yes

Parsley can be found in multiple sections of a grocery store because it is available both as fresh produce and as a dried spice. Fresh parsley is typically located in the produce section, while dried parsley is usually in the spice aisle. This dual availability is common and expected in most grocery stores."
"(A) No

Alcatraz Island is approximately 220 yards long and 420 yards wide. A standard American football field, including end zones, is 360 feet (110 meters) long and 160 feet (48.8 meters) wide. Given these dimensions, it would not be possible to fit a full-sized football field on the island without overlapping or leaving significant portions of the island unused."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable ingredient for a White Russian. The cocktail's classic flavors of vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream work well together, creating a harmonious taste experience. Adding kaffir lime would likely introduce flavors that do not complement the existing ingredients, potentially disrupting the balance and overall enjoyment of the drink."
"(A) Yes

A Goblin shark hypothetically could ride a bike if it had limbs. While it is a deep-sea fish and not adapted for life on land, the ability to ride a bike would depend on the structure and function of its hypothetical limbs, as well as its physical and cognitive capabilities."

"(B) No

A spice grinder can still be useful for grinding even the cheapest cinnamon sticks. While the quality and aroma of the cinnamon might be affected by its price, the spice grinder will effectively break down the sticks into smaller pieces, which can enhance flavor release and be beneficial for various recipes."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are devices used for launching projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational requirements. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military applications, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, slingshots are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."
"(A) No

"(B) No

Dafne Keen is an actress and not a singer, so she would not be eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. The contest requires participants to have a background in singing or be actively involved in the music industry."
"(A) Yes

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with some aspects of a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excels at swift and efficient communication but her role in mythology doesn't involve tasks like sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. While her divine speed would be an asset, her primary function was more about communication than physical delivery.

Hermes, as the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, has speed and adaptability as key attributes. However, his role in mythology includes guiding souls and playing tricks, which might not be the most helpful skills in a UPS job. Additionally, Hermes' trickster nature could lead to complications in a professional setting where reliability and adherence to rules are crucial.

Both deities would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which involves following specific procedures, adhering to schedules, and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job compared to a more fluid and less structured role like a messenger or courier."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, which consists mainly of cookies, is not Paleo-friendly. The Paleo diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods such as meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, while avoiding processed foods and grains.

"(A) Yes

Breast cancer is associated with a pink ribbon, which has become a widely recognized symbol for breast cancer awareness and support."
"(B) No

Lactic acid is a normal byproduct of muscle metabolism, especially during intense exercise. While it can cause muscle fatigue and a burning sensation, it is not inherently bad for your body. The body naturally clears lactic acid after exercise. High levels of lactic acid can indicate a medical condition like lactic acidosis, but this is uncommon and usually associated with underlying health issues."
"(A) No

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to assassinate King James I and overthrow the Protestant monarchy. It did not target Mary, Queen of Scots, who had died in 1587. Therefore, the plot did not eliminate the bloodline of Mary, Queen of Scots."
"(A) Yes

The main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Alice, could potentially join a Masonic Lodge if she were an adult and met the specific requirements of the Lodge. The Masonic Lodge is open to men who are of good character and meet the age and other membership criteria set by the particular Lodge or Grand Lodge.

"(A) No

While art education is often included in U.S. schools, it is not universally prioritized.

The story of Jesus, as presented in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is not considered to be directly inspired by Egyptian myths. While there are some parallels between certain elements of the Jesus narrative and various mythological or cultural traditions, these parallels are often seen as coincidental or the result of common human experiences and storytelling techniques. Many scholars argue that the similarities between the stories of Jesus and other figures in different cultures can be attributed to universal themes and motifs found in religious and mythological narratives. The development of the Christian narrative about Jesus was influenced by a variety of factors, including Jewish religious traditions, Greek and Roman philosophical ideas, and the cultural context of the early Christian communities."
