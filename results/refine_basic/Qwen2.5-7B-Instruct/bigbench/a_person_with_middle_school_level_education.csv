1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips is in House 1 (directly left of House 2, where the flutist lives).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies is in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist is in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The only instrument left is percussion, which must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green

2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis

3. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in the second and third houses.
   - House 2: Blue, Gameboy
   - House 3: (Not Blue, Not Gameboy)

4. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in the third house.
   - House 3: Percussionist

5. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - Since the root beer lover must be in the third house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the second house.
   - House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - The person who has a television must be in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

7. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - The person who only drinks water is already in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

8. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
   - The person who has a gameboy is in the second house, so the cellist must be in the third house.

So, the cellist lives in House 3.

The correct answer is:
\(\boxed{C}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing some characteristics:

- The tennis player lives in the fifth house (Clue 15).
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house (Clue 5), so the tennis player and the person eating kiwis are the same person.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce more:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player (Clue 9), so the tea drinker is in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker (Clue 11), so the person who only drinks water is in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. This means the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but there are only five houses, so we need to re-evaluate.

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house (Clue 18).
- The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana (Clue 6), so the person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana (Clue 13), so the person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes red lives in the second house (Clue 7).
- The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other (Clue 2), so the cricketer is in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer (Clue 3), so the person who is wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- The root beer lover does not live in the first house (Clue 4) or the third house (Clue 12), so the root beer lover is in the second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green (Clue 1), so the person who likes green is in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 4.

10. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
    - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

From the clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Apples
- House 2: Pizza (since the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, and the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 or 2, the only option is house 2)
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Mangos (since the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live next to each other, and house 2 is pizza, house 4 must be mangos)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since house 1 is apples, house 2 is pizza, and house 3 is high heels, the only option for loafers and convertible is house 1 and 2, but house 2 is pizza, so house 1 must be loafers and house 2 must be convertible.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since house 1 is loafers, house 2 is convertible, the only option for truck and SUV is house 1 and 2, but house 1 is loafers, so house 1 must be truck and house 2 must be SUV.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since house 1 is truck, house 2 is SUV, house 3 is high heels, and house 4 is mangos, the only option for running shoes and spaghetti is house 3 and 4, but house 3 is high heels, so house 3 must be running shoes and house 4 must be spaghetti.
- The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. Since house 1 is truck, house 2 is SUV, house 3 is running shoes, and house 4 is spaghetti, the only option for grapes and coffee drinker is house 2 and 3, but house 2 is SUV, so house 2 must be coffee drinker and house 3 must be grapes.
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since house 1 is truck, house 2 is SUV, house 3 is running shoes, and house 4 is spaghetti, the only option for root beer lover and running shoes is house 1 and 2, but house 1 is truck, so house 1 must be root beer lover and house 2 must be SUV.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Apples, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Pizza, Coffee Drinker
- House 3: High Heels, Grapes
- House 4: Mangos, Spaghetti

The tea drinker must be in house 2, as the only person left is the tea drinker.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is \boxed{2}."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water also lives in house 5. This means the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who only drinks water are the same person, living in house 5.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the coffee drinker is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1, and the person who had stew must be in house 2.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.

3. **Combining Clues 2 and 4**: Since the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges, and they are next to each other, the only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Swimmer
   - House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Person eating oranges

4. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Given the arrangement from Clue 4, the soccer player must be in house 1.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

6. **Assigning Sports and Fruits**:
   - House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
   - House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
   - House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The violinist lives in the first house.
8. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- The violinist lives in the first house (Clue 7).

Now, let's use the clues to figure out the rest:

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house. But since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second or third house. Given that the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. But the second house has the bouquet of daffodils, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a radio and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person has a different device, flower arrangement, musical instrument, pet, and book preference.

Here are the clues:
1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start placing the information we know for sure:

- From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the second house.
- From clue 4, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
- From clue 5, the percussionist must be in the first house, and the computer must be in the second house.
- From clue 3, the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house.
- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.
- From clue 7, the gameboy must be in the first house, and the rose bouquet must be in the second house.
- From clue 8, the cellist cannot be in the third house, so the cellist must be in the first or second house. But since the first house is already occupied by the history book buff, the cellist must be in the second house.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:

- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

The person who has a gameboy lives in **House 1**.

So, the answer is: **(A) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start by placing the horse owner in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 5).

- House 3: Horses

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the dog owner and the person with the bouquet of lilies.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the radio and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (they must be next to each other)

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 10 to place the banana and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 2 or 3: Banana (one house between them)

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the apple and cat lover.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 1: Apple (one house between them)

Since the apple is to the left of the cat lover, the cat lover must be in House 4.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 12 to place the orange and apple.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Since there is one house between the apple and orange, the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we use Clue 13 to place the banana and cat lover.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Since there are two houses between the banana and cat lover, the banana must be in House 1 and the cat lover in House 4.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we need to place the fruits and pets.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 1, the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

- House 1: Fish
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 5, the horse owner is in House 3.

- House 1: Fish
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 7, the apple is to the left of the cat lover, so the apple must be in House 1.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 12, the orange is to the left of the apple, so the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we need to place the devices and pets.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

The person with the phone must be in House 2.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person wears different shoes: one wears sandals and one wears boots.
3. Each person likes a different kind of book: one reads mystery books and one reads history books.
4. Each person drives a different kind of car: one drives a convertible and one drives a truck.

From the clues:
- Clue 1: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, and the history book buff lives in house 2.
- Clue 2: The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 2.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

First, we know the golfer lives in the first house:
1. Golfer

Next, let's use Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means:
- The mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible).
- The only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff

Now, let's use Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means:
- The swimmer cannot be in House 3 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 4, and the golfer is in House 1).
- The only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover

But Clue 4 says the swimmer does not live in the third house. So, the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Finally, Clue 2 says the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be there.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as given in Clue 3. So, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person with a gameboy must be in House 2.
- The person with a computer must be in House 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green is in House 1.
- The person with a gameboy is in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Computer

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 2. Since the person with a gameboy is in House 2, the person in House 2 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 2 must like green, but we already know the person in House 1 likes green. So, the person in House 2 must like yellow.

Now, the person in House 3 must like blue because the person in House 1 likes green and the person in House 2 likes yellow.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (computer)
- House 3: Blue (phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's place the people based on these clues:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person in house 1 likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a radio.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio. Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

So, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step and try to figure out the correct house for each person.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
4. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. The dog owner lives in the second house.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
12. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
13. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
14. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
16. The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.
18. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From these clues, we can start placing the information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already taken by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already taken, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff, so the bird keeper must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already taken, the bird keeper must live in the third house.
- The fish enthusiast must live in the fourth house because there is one house between the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the root beer lover must live in the third house and the romance book lover must live in the fourth house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other, so they must live in the fourth and fifth houses.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the first and third houses are already taken, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth houses, so they must live in the first house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the tea drinker must live in the first house and the person who likes white must live in the second house.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the cellist must be in the third house.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From this, we can summarize:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives and what they are doing.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by placing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - If the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person in the first house has a phone.
2. The person in the second house does not have boots, so the person in the first house must be wearing boots.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the first house has a phone, the person in the second house must have a radio and own horses.

So, we can summarize:
- The first house has a phone and boots.
- The second house has horses and a radio.

The only characteristic left is high heels, which must belong to the person in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

Let's start solving:

1. From Clue 1 and Clue 9, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other. So, the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who is wearing loafers, and the person who has a computer must be in the same house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house (Clue 2), they must live in house 1 or 2.

2. From Clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house. So, the person who is eating apples must live in house 2 or 3.

3. From Clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who is eating grapes must live in house 2 or 3.

4. From Clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. So, the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 3.

5. From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1 or 2.

6. From Clue 7, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. So, the person who had pizza must live in house 1 or 3.

7. From Clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who is eating mangos must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 2 or 3.

8. From Clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. So, the person who has a computer must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who has a phone must live in house 2 or 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce:
- The person who ate grilled cheese, the person who is wearing loafers, and the person who has a computer must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating apples must be in house 3.
- The person who is wearing boots must be in house 2.
- The person who is eating grapes must be in house 3.

- The person who has a phone must be in house 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 1.

7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

First, we know the baseball player lives in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3.

- House 1: (Not pianist, not high heels)
- House 2: Pianist
- House 3: High heels

Now, the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, or house 2 and house 1. Since the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively.

- House 1: (Not high heels, not running shoes, not percussionist)
- House 2: Pianist, running shoes
- House 3: High heels

Next, the person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Pianist, running shoes, boots
- House 3: High heels

The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

- House 1: Kiwis, radio
- House 2: Pianist, running shoes, boots
- House 3: High heels, television

So, the person with a television lives in house 3.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has fried rice.

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has the swimmer.

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White

Next, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Now, let's use Clue 10:
- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Next, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:
- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Now, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White

Since the person who drives a truck cannot live in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals must be to the right of the truck owner, the truck owner must be in the third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house.

- House 3: Truck
- House 4: Sandals

Since the person who likes green must be to the left of the truck owner, the person who likes green must be in the second house.

- House 2: Green

The person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

- House 1: Loafers
- House 2: Minivan

The person who likes yellow must be in the first house, and the person who likes red must be in the second house.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Red

The person who owns an SUV must be in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house.

- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Sedan

Finally, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out where each person lives and what they like to read and eat.

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

So, we have:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

Now, let's figure out what they ate:
- The history book buff is in the first house, so they must have eaten fried rice.
- The fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, so they must have eaten pizza.
- The person who had stew is in the third house.

The only book type left for the third house is science fiction.

So, the final arrangement is:

From the clues, we can see that House 2 cannot be apples, flutist, science fiction book fanatic, fried rice, stew, or pizza. The only thing left for House 2 is grilled cheese.

- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- Different flowers in the foyer: lilies, carnations, daffodils
- Different favorite colors: green, blue, yellow
- Different types of shoes: boots, loafers, high heels
- Different book preferences: romance, history, science fiction

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.

6. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live next to each other.

Let's start solving:

- From Clue 3, the history book buff is in House 2.
- From Clue 7, the daffodils are in House 2.
- From Clue 6, the loafers are in House 3.
- From Clue 2, the yellow person is not in House 1.
- From Clue 4, the yellow person is not in House 3.
- Therefore, the yellow person must be in House 2.

Since the yellow person is in House 2, the boots must be in House 1 (Clue 8).

Now, let's look at Clue 5: The lilies must be in a house to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

Since the boots are in House 1 and the yellow person is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3. Therefore, the lilies must be in House 3.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, must be science fiction book fanatic and green.
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff.
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies and green.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person with the radio lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.
3. The person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

12. The person with the rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
13. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist.
14. The person with the radio lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the radio in the fourth house.

Since the person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house, the bouquet of daffodils could be in the first or second house. 

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the vase of tulips would be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the second or third house.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with the gameboy. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies would be in the first house, and the gameboy would be in the third house.

The person with the television does not live in the second house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the television would be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television would be in the first or third house.

If the television is in the first house, the person with the television would be in the first house, the radio in the fourth house, the bouquet of daffodils in the second house, the vase of tulips in the third house, and the rose bouquet in the first house. This leaves the gameboy in the third house, which is consistent with the bouquet of lilies being in the first house.

The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the fish enthusiast would be in the first house.

The bird keeper lives to the right of the person with the convertible. If the convertible is in the first house, the bird keeper would be in the second house, but the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, so the convertible must be in the third house, and the bird keeper in the fourth house.

The guitarist lives to the left of the person with the horses. If the horses are in the fifth house, the guitarist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the horses must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the third house.

The fish enthusiast and the person with the SUV live next to each other. If the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the SUV would be in the second house.

The percussionist lives directly left of the person with the carnations. If the carnations are in the fifth house, the percussionist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the carnations must be in the fifth house, and the percussionist in the fourth house.

The person with the rose bouquet does not live in the third house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house.

The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist would be in the second house, but the fish enthusiast is in the first house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, the person wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the root beer lover must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who owns a sedan, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step using the clues provided.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

   - This means the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Television, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the banana eater must live in House 4.

Now, we know:
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the history book buff must live in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

Using Clue 4:
- The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. So, the person eating apples must live in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 is already taken by the history book buff, so the person eating apples must live in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

Using Clue 3:
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. So, the person wearing running shoes must live in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

Using Clue 5:
- The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. So, the person eating mangos must live in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2. But House 1 is already taken by the person eating apples, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the person eating mangos must live in House 2, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes
- House 2: Eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

Using Clue 2:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in House 4.

Now, we have:

- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic, eating banana

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above, we know:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

The person in the second house is not wearing loafers (since the first house person is wearing loafers). The only other option for the second house is sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house:
- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

From Clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house:
- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house:
- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house:
- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house:
- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house:

- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

From these clues, we can start placing some information:

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Next, we use Clue 5 and 19:
- The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house, so red must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, so white must be in House 1, 2, or 3, and stew must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone:
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 1, the person with a phone must be in House 2.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 2, the person with a phone must be in House 3.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the person with a phone must be in House 4.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 4, the person with a phone must be in House 5.

- If the cat lover is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television:
- If the person who owns horses is in House 1, the person with a television must be in House 2.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 2, the person with a television must be in House 3.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 3, the person with a television must be in House 4.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.

By analyzing all the clues, we can deduce that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Sure, let's think through this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. We also know that the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.

This means the person with the computer, who is not the one with the bouquet of lilies, must be in the second house.

So, the person with the computer lives in the second house.

The answer is:
(A) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step, like we're figuring out a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person had pizza and one had spaghetti for lunch.
- One has a vase of tulips and one has a bouquet of daffodils in their foyer.
- One likes history books and one likes science fiction books.
- One is a baseball player and one is a golfer.
- One plays the guitar and one plays percussion.

We have some clues to help us figure out who lives where:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

Let's think about it:

1. From clue 1, the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.
2. From clue 2, the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.
3. From clue 3, the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2.

Let's try to fit everything together:

- If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
- This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

So, we have:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, let's assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).
- The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1).
- The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2).

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

So, the violinist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the golfer is in the fourth house (clue 3), the soccer player must be in the fifth house. So, the soccer player is in House 5, and the person who ate grilled cheese is also in House 5 (clue 2).

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Golfer
- House 5: Soccer player (and grilled cheese)

From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the only possible positions for stew and spaghetti are House 1 and House 3. But House 3 is taken by the tennis player, so the only option is House 1 for stew and House 3 for spaghetti.

Now we have:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Golfer
- House 5: Soccer player (and grilled cheese)

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti. Since the tennis player is in House 3 and the soccer player is in House 5, the only possible positions for fried rice and spaghetti are House 1 and House 3. But House 1 is stew and House 3 is tennis player, so the only option is House 2 for fried rice and House 4 for spaghetti.

Now we have:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Fried rice
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese (golfer)
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. The only houses left are House 1 and House 2. Since House 1 is stew, the only option is House 2 for pizza and House 1 for the cricketer.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese (golfer)
- House 5: Soccer player

The cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's put the pieces together:
- House 1: The person who likes white, drinks water, and is a swimmer.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti, drinks milk, and is a baseball player.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to figure out which house the root beer lover lives in.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. So, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker must live in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot live in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the third house, the water drinker must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

So, the answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first or third house. But since the first house is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Sure, let's think through this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house, so the tennis player must live in the second house.

Since the first house has the mystery book reader, the second house must have the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
3. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
4. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

From Clue 5 and Clue 8, we can deduce that the basketball player cannot be in House 1 (since the cellist is there). Let's try placing the basketball player in House 3 or 4.

- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's try the basketball player in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player
- **House 4:** (Not yet determined)

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** (Not yet determined)
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 4 and the cricketer in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** (Not yet determined)
- **House 3:** Cricketer
- **House 4:** Flutist

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out where each person lives and what they like or do:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know:
- The person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Now, let's use the other clues:
- Clue 3 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes, the grilled cheese and white preferences must be in the second and third houses.
- Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- Clue 5 tells us that the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.
- Clue 2 tells us that the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.
- Clue 4 tells us that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."

5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the kiwi eater lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner cannot live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the apple eater must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green

2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means if pizza is in House 2, blue is in House 3.

3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.

   - This means if mangos are in House 2, red is in House 3.

7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if truck is in House 2, lilies are in House 3.

8. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
    - This means if blue is in House 2, SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 2, red must be in House 3, but blue is in House 3. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating grapes does not live in the first house. So, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the cricketer must be in the first house.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 is the one with the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. But since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

So, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."

- One person plays soccer and one swims.
- One person has a phone and one has a gameboy.
- One person has tulips and one has roses.

Here are the clues:
1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person with roses.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person with the gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Now, using clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with roses. This means the person with roses must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, roses
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- The person who likes yellow (in the third house) lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

Using clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must live in the fourth house.

Using clue 4:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must live in the first house. Therefore, the white person must live in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Wearing loafers (This conflicts with clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the coffee drinker lives in the third house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.)
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

6. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - C and Ck are next to each other

9. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - Oranges ≠ House 3

10. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

11. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

13. There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

14. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1.

So, the answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the golfer must have the bouquet of lilies and the basketball player must have eaten grilled cheese.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the basketball player in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (the soccer player's house).

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the basketball player in house 2 must have tulips.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips (ate grilled cheese)
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, using the clues provided:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The pianist lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, let's look at Clue 7:
- The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, the person who likes green cannot live in the third house. So, the person who likes green must live in one of the other houses.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.

This means the saxophonist can live in House 1, 2, or 4.

Next, Clue 6:
- The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

This means the person who had stew and the person who likes yellow must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 8:
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

This means the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white must be in houses that are three houses apart.

Using Clue 10:
- The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

This means the percussionist and cellist must be in consecutive houses, and the percussionist is to the left of the cellist.

Let's place the percussionist and cellist:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

We need to place stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food. Using Clue 4:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

This means:
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in one of the other houses, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in house 3:
- House 3: Tea drinker

Next, we know the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 or 3.

The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. So, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 or 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2, 3, or 4, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 or 4.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3.

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. So, these two people must be in consecutive houses.

The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's put it all together:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

  - House 4: Basketball player

- Clue 11: The cricketer lives in the third house.
  - House 3: Cricketer

- Clue 12: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

- Clue 3: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
  - The root beer lover must be in house 2 or 4.

- Clue 9: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
  - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

- Clue 2: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
  - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
  - This means stew and fried rice are in adjacent houses, with stew to the left.

- Clue 10: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

- Clue 1: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2, because if they were, the root beer lover would have to be in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist is in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must be in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Not a root beer lover, not a horse owner, not white color lover

Since the person in house 1 likes white, the person in house 2 cannot like white. Also, the person in house 2 cannot own horses and cannot be a root beer lover.

Given that the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. This means the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."

5. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 5, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. The possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. The possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Now, let's summarize the possible positions:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

From clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

From clue 1:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

So, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Apple eater
- House 3: Apple eater (but this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Since the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since the coffee drinker is not in house 2 and must be left of the milk drinker).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, or the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

4. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 and must be next to the person who likes white, and the person who likes white must be in House 1, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

The person who likes red must be in House 3 because the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red are next to each other, and the only remaining house is House 3.

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3, the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the lilies are in the second house, the tulips must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tulips and water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, and the only drink left is water. Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the third house.

   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Now, let's fill in the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**

  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 2). Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (Clue 3). Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. But the romance book lover is in the second house, so the pizza eater must be in the third house.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover (Clue 5). Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This means the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.
5. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff (Clue 1). Since the history book buff is in the third house, the green lover must be in the first or second house. But the yellow lover is in the first house, so the green lover must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Yellow lover

- The golfer does not live in the second house. So, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.

Next, Clue 3:
- The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

Now, Clue 5:
- The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 4:
- The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

Finally, Clue 1:
- The tennis player lives to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

Let's put it all together:
- If the golfer is in house 1, the computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3. But this doesn't work because the radio would have to be in house 3, and the television would be in house 2, which doesn't fit Clue 4.
- If the golfer is in house 3, the computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2. This works because:
  - The television is in house 2.
  - The radio is in house 3.
  - The rose bouquet is in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Television
- House 3: Radio

The person who has a computer lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve the problem step by step using the clues provided:

1. **The swimmer lives in the third house.**
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. **The violinist lives in the second house.**
   - Violinist: House 2

6. **The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

7. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. **The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:

- From Clue 1, the swimmer is in House 3.
- From Clue 5, the violinist is in House 2.
- From Clue 9, the cricketer is in House 4.
- From Clue 11, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5.

Since the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other, and the basketball player is to the left of the guitarist, and the guitarist is to the right of the violinist (House 2), the basketball player must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2 (but this contradicts the violinist being in House 2). So, the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2
- Violinist: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person has different pets: one has a dog and one has a fish.
3. Each person ate something different for lunch: one had stew and one had grilled cheese.
4. Each person is wearing different shoes: one is wearing high heels and one is wearing sandals.

From the clues:
1. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

So, we can fill in the information we have:
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Now, we need to figure out what the person in each house ate:
- House 1: Dog owner, High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must have eaten stew.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

1. The person with a phone lives in the third house.
2. The flutist lives in the third house.
3. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clues 1, 2, and 3, we know the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. The gameboy lives to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

6. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house (from clue 15).

7. The romance book lover lives in the first house (from clue 7).

8. The person wearing high heels lives two houses to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast (from clue 10).

9. The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other (from clue 1).

10. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots (from clue 5).

11. The saxophonist lives to the left of the person wearing boots (from clue 3).

12. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house (from clue 8).

13. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house (from clue 13).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The first house is occupied by the romance book lover.
- The second house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- The third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes.
- The fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

Since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots and the person wearing boots lives to the left of the saxophonist, the person wearing boots must be in the first house, the saxophonist in the second house, and the person eating oranges in the third house.

Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start with the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses. So, the sequence is: pizza, yellow, tea.

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the orange eater.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7:
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other (Clue 6), and the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

From Clue 4:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
- The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

From Clue 2:
- There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
- The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 1:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. But House 4 already has the Television, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the boots must be in House 1.
   - So, House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - So, House 1: Boots, Radio
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The only devices left are the Gameboy and the Phone. Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers and House 4 has the Television, the Phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves the Gameboy for House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out where each person lives and what they drink and wear:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

This means the first house must be the one with loafers.

Now, let's assign the drinks:
- Clue 3 says the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 says the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.

This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know that the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, if the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house, then they must live in the second house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader does not live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. From Clue 3, the person with running shoes is not in the third house, so they must be in House 1 or House 2.

From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew. This means:
- If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
- If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio. This means:
- If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
- If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
- If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
- If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
- If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
- If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person with the lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house. So, the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

So, the person eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. But the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the swimmer must be in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
6. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
9. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the person who has a phone must be in the fifth house.
10. The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
12. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the person who likes milk must be in the fifth house.

From these deductions, we can see that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different kind of car. Here are the clues:

1. The person with the vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person with the SUV lives directly left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
3. The person with the sedan and the person with the rose bouquet live next to each other.
4. The person with the rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet cannot be in the second house. So, it must be in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's consider each case:

**Case 1: Rose bouquet in house 1**
- From Clue 3, the person with the sedan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person with the SUV must be in house 2, and the person with the lilies must be in house 3.
- From Clue 1, the vase of tulips cannot be in house 3, so it must be in house 2.

This gives us:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Sedan and tulips
- House 3: SUV and lilies

This arrangement fits all the clues.

**Case 2: Rose bouquet in house 3**
- From Clue 3, the person with the sedan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person with the SUV must be in house 2, and the person with the lilies must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the vase of tulips cannot be in house 1, so it must be in house 2.

This gives us:
- House 1: SUV and lilies
- House 2: Sedan and tulips
- House 3: Rose bouquet

This arrangement also fits all the clues.

Since both cases fit the clues, we need to determine which one is correct. However, the question asks for the house where the person who drives a truck lives. In both cases, the truck is in house 3.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step, using the clues provided.

1. The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other.

8. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
9. The person with a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the pianist.
10. The violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
11. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. The violinist lives to the left of the person who only drinks water.
14. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 4 to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we need to fit these pairs into the remaining houses.

Using Clue 6 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives to the left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 9, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the pianist.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 13, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 8, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 12 and Clue 5, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.
4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. The person who likes yellow is in the first house, so the swimmer cannot be in the first house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. So, the SUV must be in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.
8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.
9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.
10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.
11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.
12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the second or third house. The swimmer must be in the first or third house. Given the constraints, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first or third house. Since the first house has stew, the grilled cheese must be in the third house.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew is in the first house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different characteristic for flowers, musical instruments, cars, pets, and favorite colors. We need to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

1. The person with a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other.
2. There is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

6. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other.
7. The person with carnations lives in the first house.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start with what we know:
- House 1 has carnations.
- House 3 has yellow.

From Clue 1, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 because House 1 has carnations and House 3 has yellow.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow is in House 3, so House 3 is yellow.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. Since House 3 is yellow, the horses and blue must be in House 2 or House 1.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other, and they must be in House 2 and House 1.

From Clue 3, the rose bouquet is in House 2 because there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, the bird keeper is in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist also lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person in house 1 must like green, and the person in house 2 must like red.

From these clues, we can fill in the information:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast and cellist, likes green.
- House 2: Must be the mystery book reader (since the only remaining book type is mystery) and likes red.

So, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

6. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
7. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.

13. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

Since the golfer is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the second house. Also, the history book buff is in the first house, so the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house either. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

Now, we know:
- The science fiction book fanatic is in the third house.
- The golfer is in the second house.
- The history book buff is in the first house.

The only house left for the swimmer is the first house. However, we need to check the clue about the one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Given these clues, let's think about the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals. This scenario is consistent with all clues.

- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff. But this would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals. This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Now, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Since we need to find the house number where the person who ate fried rice lives, and based on the consistency of the clues, we can conclude:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 on the left and 2 on the right.
2. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different musical instrument.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
4. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we can deduce:
- The person with the sedan must live in house 1 because the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The flutist cannot live in house 1, so the flutist must live in house 2.

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the saxophonist. And since the person in house 2 has the bouquet of lilies, the person in house 1 must have the bouquet of daffodils.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

   - Since the rose bouquet is in the third house, the daffodils must be in the first house.

So, we have:
1. Daffodils
2. ?
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

4. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
   - The mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the rose bouquet is in the third house, they must be in the first and second houses.

5. **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house and the swimmer is in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

6. **Clue 2:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
   - The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the tennis player must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet, so the tennis player must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Carnations

7. **Clue 5:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - The daffodils are in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the carnations, so the golfer must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Golfer
4. Carnations

8. **Clue 7:** The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is already satisfied since the tennis player is in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.
   - The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Golfer

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives in the third house.

14. **Clue 15:** The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 16:** The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
16. **Clue 17:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 3:** Coffee drinker (Clue 3)
- **House 5:** Milk drinker (Clue 14)

Since the television cannot be in House 5 (Clue 15), it must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Television

Now, let's place the gameboy and computer:

- **Clue 5:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
- **Clue 12:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.

This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1, and the carnations arrangement must be in House 2 (since the percussionist must be to the right of the carnations arrangement).

- **House 2:** Carnations arrangement
- **House 4:** Television

Next, let's place the root beer lover:

- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a rose bouquet lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the root beer lover cannot be in House 3. The only possible positions for the root beer lover are House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Given the two flowers are one house apart, and considering the other placements, the root beer lover must be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Root beer lover

Now, let's place the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 10:** The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 16:** The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.

Given the placements, the only possible positions for the phone and vase of tulips are House 4 and 5, and the only possible positions for the water drinker and saxophonist are House 2 and 3.

- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

Finally, the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

Thus, the answer is:
**(E) 5**"
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
5. The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
8. The golfer lives in the first house.
9. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:

- From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
- From clue 8, the golfer lives in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 3: Minivan

Now, let's use clue 1:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
- This means the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Minivan

Next, let's use clue 4:
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the cricketer lives in the second house, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.

But we already know the second house has boots and the third house has a minivan. So, the cricketer must live in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Vase of tulips
- House 3: Minivan

Now, let's use clue 5:
- The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
- This means the person who had pizza lives in the first or third house.

But we already know the first house is the golfer, so the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Vase of tulips
- House 3: Pizza

Now, let's use clue 2:
- The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
- This means the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Vase of tulips
- House 3: Pizza

Finally, let's use clue 3:
- The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
- This means the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second or third house.

Since the second house has a vase of tulips and the third house has pizza, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Pizza

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

3. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist are in consecutive houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

4. **Clue 10**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the root beer lover is in a house to the left of the percussionist.

5. **Clue 15**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the cellist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

6. **Clue 3**: The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are in consecutive houses, with the cellist to the left.

7. **Clue 11**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses, with the person who ate spaghetti to the left.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue are three houses apart.

10. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
    - This means the person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of House 3.

11. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

12. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

13. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red
- The person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who likes yellow lives in House 3, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and the person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, the only consistent placement for the person who likes green is House 5. This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively.

Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the third house is not for the basketball player or the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is not for the violinist or the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's check the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

   - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

4. There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
   - This means the phone and television are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. But since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the coffee drinker is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5.

5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
   - Since the cellist is in house 5, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3), so the percussionist is in house 5.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
   - So the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3.

8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3).

    - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3).

14. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
    - Since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 4 and the coffee drinker is in house 3.

15. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
    - So the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5.

16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
    - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist).

From the above steps, we can conclude that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

From Clues 5 and 6, we see that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Given that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1, let's assume the saxophonist and the basketball player are in different houses:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 likes history books.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. **House 1: Carnations**
2. **House 3: Apples**
3. **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
4. **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 2, which is already occupied by pizza. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 4.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step using the clues provided.

1. **House 2:** The history book buff lives here (Clue 3).
2. **House 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here (Clue 12).
3. **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here (Clue 10 and 10).
4. **House 1:** The person who had pizza lives here (Clue 10 and 10).

Now, let's use the flower and instrument clues:

- **House 2:** The history book buff lives here, so the person who has a rose bouquet must live directly left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1, and the person who likes yellow lives in House 3.
- **House 1:** The person who had pizza lives here, and they have a carnations arrangement (Clue 4).
- **House 2:** The history book buff lives here, and the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, the guitarist lives in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 3.
- **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here, and they have a vase of tulips.
- **House 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here, and the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the person who likes white lives in House 3, and the romance book lover lives in House 4.

Now, let's use the instrument and lunch clues:

- **House 1:** The person who had pizza lives here, and they have a carnations arrangement.
- **House 2:** The history book buff lives here, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the percussionist lives in House 1.
- **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here, and they have a vase of tulips.
- **House 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here, and the person who likes white lives here.

Finally, we need to place the cellist:

- The flutist does not live in the first house (Clue 9).
- The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist and the person who had pizza. So, the person who likes blue lives in House 1.
- The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

Therefore, the cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

- From Clue 1, the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other. This means they can only be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 4, the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater cannot be in houses 1 and 2, because they would only be one house apart. Therefore, the violinist and the kiwi-eater must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 3 and 1.
- From Clue 2, the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist must be in house 1 and the flutist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 3, there is one house between the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater. Since the violinist is in house 1 and the flutist is in house 3, the only place left for the kiwi-eater is house 2. This means the grapes-eater must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know that the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. We also know that the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step, using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other.
5. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner.
8. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper.
9. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
10. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The first house is yellow.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The third house is red and has a radio.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the third house is occupied by the person who has a radio, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. But the third house is already occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.

3. One person is a pianist and the other is a cellist.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
5. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the first house because they cannot live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the pianist lives in the first house and the cellist lives in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

From the clues, we can now fill in the houses:

- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and see where each person fits.

1. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.
2. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the house immediately to the left of the person who likes white.

From Clues 10, 9, 3, and 4, we can deduce:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Person who likes white
- House 3: Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tea drinker

5. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. So, the baseball player must live in either House 1, 3, or 4.

Since the swimmer is in House 1, the baseball player cannot be in House 1. Also, the baseball player cannot be in House 2 because it's already occupied by the person who likes white. Therefore, the baseball player must live in either House 3 or 4.

6. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

9. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

10. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house, so they must be in the third house. The fantasy book enthusiast, then, must be in the first house.
4. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement.
5. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.
6. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with a carnations arrangement, so the carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.
7. The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips, and since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house. The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

(C) 4"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1.
3. This means the person in House 2 is wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we know:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 because it's to the left of house 2.
- Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

Given these clues, let's figure out the arrangement:

- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow would be in house 2, but house 2 already has the convertible, so this is not possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow would be in house 1. This is possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow would be in house 0, which is not possible.

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who owns a sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Person who likes white

Now, let's assign the colors and cars:
- The person in house 2 (sedan and convertible) is not the one who likes white or yellow.
- The person in house 1 (yellow) is not the one who owns a sedan.
- The person in house 3 (white) is not the one who owns a sedan.

Since the person in house 2 owns a sedan and has a convertible, the person in house 1 must like yellow, and the person in house 3 must like white. The only car left for the person in house 1 is the minivan, and the only car left for the person in house 3 is the sedan.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow, Minivan
- House 2: White, Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: Blue, Sedan

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

   - If the bird keeper is in House 5, the sandals must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives.
   - Since the running shoes are in House 1, the bird keeper must be in House 4 (2 houses to the right).

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Not high heels

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house and the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2:
- The person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

Using clue 1:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic and the fantasy book enthusiast are already assigned, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the clues given:

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person in house 2 is eating kiwis (clue 3).
2. The person in house 1 drinks water because the person in house 2 can't drink water (clue 1).
3. The person in house 1 wears sandals because the person in house 2 can't wear sandals (clue 2).

Now, let's fill in the remaining details:
- The person in house 1 can't wear high heels (clue 1), so they must be wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 can't drink water, so they must be drinking milk.

So, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- One person has a television and one has a phone.
- One person is wearing sandals and one is wearing high heels.
- One person drinks tea and one drinks water.
- One person is eating kiwis and one is eating grapes.

Here are the clues:
1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person wearing high heels is in the left house (House 1) and the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From clue 3, we know:
- The tea drinker is in the left house (House 1) and the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

So, we can fill in the characteristics:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Now, we need to assign the fruits:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (since the only fruit left is kiwis).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's place the information:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, we know:
  - House 1: Tea drinker

- The violinist cannot be in house 3, and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist. This means the violinist and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

- From Clue 1, the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist. This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the water drinker must be in house 2 or 3 if the cellist is in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Let's test the possibilities:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This means the cellist must be in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This would place the water drinker in house 3. This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3)
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker (from Clue 1)

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person in these houses has different characteristics:
   - One is a percussionist and one is a guitarist.
   - One had pizza and one ate grilled cheese.
   - One is a dog owner and one is a bird keeper.

3. Clue 1: The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, because if they did, the grilled cheese eater would have to be in house 1, which would not satisfy the clue.

4. Clue 2: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in house 1.

Given these clues:
- The bird keeper cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1.
- The percussionist lives in house 1, so the bird keeper cannot be the percussionist.
- The grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 because the bird keeper is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper.

Therefore, the pizza eater must live in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. From Clue 2, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.
2. Clue 1 tells us the cat lover does not live in the second house.
3. Clue 3 says the golfer lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. Clue 4 states the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. Clue 5 tells us the baseball player does not live in the third house.
6. Clue 6 says the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
7. Clue 7 indicates the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player.
8. Clue 8 tells us the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper.
9. Clue 9 states the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The bird keeper is in the third house.
- The soccer player must be in the first or second house (since they are to the left of the bird keeper).
- The fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house and to the left of the soccer player.
- The person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house.
- The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, and since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be there.

Putting it all together, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.**
2. **The percussionist does not live in the second house.**
3. **The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.**
4. **The history book buff does not live in the second house.**
5. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.**
6. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.**
7. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.**
8. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
9. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.**
10. **The cat lover lives in the first house.**

From clue 10, we know:
- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana. So, the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. So, the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. So, the flutist cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist. So, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. So, the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. So, the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. So, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes. This is because the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).
- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).
- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).
- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Grapes.

2. **Clue 2 & Clue 5:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other, and there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 2 is already occupied by grapes, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - So, the person who likes green is in House 1 and the person who likes red is in House 3.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 1.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - The person who is eating kiwis is in House 1, so the person who likes white must be in House 2 (since House 2 is already occupied by grapes) or House 4. Since the person who likes white is not in House 2, it must be in House 4.

6. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - The person who likes red is in House 3, so the person who likes white must be in House 2 (already occupied by grapes) or House 4. Since the person who likes white is not in House 2, it must be in House 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

The person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, because if they were in house 2, the person wearing running shoes would not be to the right of them.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

3. The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 3, the root beer drinker is in the first house.
From clue 2, the water drinker is in the second house.
From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the third house.
From clue 5, the person with the television (in the third house) is to the right of the person with the vase of tulips. This means the vase of tulips must be in the first or second house. Since the first house has the root beer drinker, the vase of tulips must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Loafers

2. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Not boots

5. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Not kiwis

Now, let's place the information we have:

- House 1: Loafers, Grapes (from clue 3)

- House 1: Oranges (from Clue 1)
- House 3: Horses (from Clue 5)

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The person who eats mangos cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already taken by oranges, so the person who eats mangos must be in House 2.

- House 2: Mangos

Next, let's use Clue 6:
- The person who eats mangos (House 2) and the person who drives a convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.

This means:
- House 2: Grapes, Romance book lover.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"Let's solve this step by step!

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2, and we need to figure out who lives in each house based on the clues given.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 1.

2. **Clue 1**: The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different pet and a different type of flower in the foyer. Here are the clues:

1. The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

Let's think about each clue:

1. If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 2 or 3. But if the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there's no house to the right, so this can't be true.
2. The dog owner can't be in house 2, so the dog owner must be in house 1 or 3.
3. The tulips must be in a house to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 2, the dog owner can't be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 3. But if the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper can't be in house 1 (because the bird keeper must be to the left of the carnations). So the dog owner must be in house 3.

Now, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (because the bird keeper can't be in house 1, and the dog owner is in house 3).

So, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 3 (because the carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper).

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

The tulips must be in house 2 (because the dog owner is in house 1 and the bird keeper is in house 2, so the tulips must be to the right of the dog owner).

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step using the clues provided.

1. The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - House 3: Vase of tulips
   - House 4: Cricketer

3. The person with high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a vase of tulips.
   - House 1 or 2: High heels
   - House 3: Vase of tulips

4. The person eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Eating apples

5. There is one house between where the person with boots lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
   - If the person with boots lives in House 1, the person eating kiwis lives in House 3.
   - If the person with boots lives in House 2, the person eating kiwis lives in House 4.
   - If the person with boots lives in House 3, the person eating kiwis lives in House 1.
   - If the person with boots lives in House 4, the person eating kiwis lives in House 2.

6. The person with loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 1, 3, or 4: Wearing loafers

7. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person with sandals.
   - House 1 or 2: Phone
   - House 2 or 3: Sandals

8. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person with a computer.
   - House 1 or 2: Eating oranges
   - House 2 or 3: Computer

9. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Bouquet of lilies

10. The person with loafers does not live in the third house.
    - House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

11. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana.
    - House 1: Rose bouquet
    - House 2: Eating banana

12. The person with a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person eating a banana is in House 2. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in House 2.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mangos

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Mangos
- House 2: (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- House 3: (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- House 4: (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- House 2: Banana
- House 3: Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- House 1: Mangoes (from clue 1)
- House 4: Kiwi

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- House 1: Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- House 2: Banana, Dog Owner
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- House 4: Kiwi, Horse Owner

So, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the romance book lover cannot be there.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the horse owner must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, so the horse owner must be the bird keeper in the second house.

So, the bird keeper is in the second house, the history book buff is in the third house, and the only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out where each person lives and what they drink and eat.

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is the coffee drinker's house, so this clue needs to be re-evaluated.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first or third house. So, the person eating mangos must live in either the second or fourth house. But the second house is the coffee drinker's house, so the person eating mangos must live in the fourth house.
4. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is occupied by the person eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with our current arrangement.
5. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house. So, the person eating kiwis must live in either the first or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person eating apples, so the person eating kiwis must live in the fourth house. This conflicts with our previous deduction that the fourth house is occupied by the person eating mangos. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From the clues, we can deduce:
- The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
- The person eating apples lives in the first house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the third house.
- The person eating mangos lives in the fourth house.

So, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. Mangos

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 5. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- Favorite color: red, white, blue, green, yellow
- Sport: soccer, swimming, golf, cricket, baseball
- Fruit: banana, oranges, mangoes, kiwis, apples

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. But the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Clue 4 tells us the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. So, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Clue 5 says the person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Clue 1 says the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. So, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Clue 3 says the golfer lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. So, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Clue 2 says there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Clue 7 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who had stew. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person who plays a different musical instrument, wears a different type of shoe, has a different device, and drives a different type of car. Here are the clues:

1. The person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a minivan.
2. The person with a truck and the person with a gameboy live next to each other.
3. The person with a minivan and the cellist live next to each other.
4. The person with high heels and the person with a television live next to each other.
5. The person with a minivan lives to the right of the person with a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person with a minivan.
7. The person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

From Clue 5 and Clue 6, we know:
- The minivan must be in house 3.
- The truck must be in house 1.
- The gameboy must be in house 2 (since the truck and gameboy are next to each other).

From Clue 3, the cellist must be in house 2 (since the minivan is in house 3 and they are next to each other).

From Clue 6, the flutist must be in house 1 (since the flutist is directly left of the minivan).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan

From Clue 4, the high heels and television are next to each other. Since the cellist has the television, the high heels must be in house 1 (flutist's house).

From Clue 7, the boots must be in house 3 (since the boots are to the right of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be in house 2).

So, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

(A) 4"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- Therefore, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- Since the person who has a rose bouquet (house 1) is directly left of the person who drives a truck (house 3), the person who likes blue must be in house 1.
- Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:

5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's place the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - The person who likes white cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.
   - Since the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person with the phone must be in the second house, and the person with running shoes must be in the third house.
   - House 2: Phone
   - House 3: Running shoes, Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.
   - Since the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the second house.
   - House 1: Apples, Sandals
   - House 2: Phone, Red, Sandals
   - House 3: Gameboy, Grapes

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The bird keeper lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
8. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Bird keeper

From clue 9, since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

From clue 9 and clue 7, since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (because the person who ate grilled cheese is to the left of the guitarist).

From clue 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 4 (because the guitarist is in house 3 and the pizza eater is to the right of the guitarist).

From clue 4, the violinist must be in house 1 or house 3, but since house 1 is already the grilled cheese eater and house 3 is the guitarist, the violinist must be in house 1 or house 3. Since the violinist cannot be in house 1 (grilled cheese eater), the violinist must be in house 3, and the rose bouquet person must be in house 4.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in house 2 (bird keeper), the tulips must be in house 1 (grilled cheese eater).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

Since the saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other (Clue 2), the golfer must live in the second house (House 2).

From Clue 3, the baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 1, the tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.

From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can only live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist also lives in the second house.

This seems contradictory, so let's assume the clues are referring to different people. The second house must be occupied by one of these people, and the other person's characteristic (instrument or sport) must be in the first or third house.

3. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The violinist lives in the second house.

Since the violinist is in the second house, the cellist cannot be in the second house. The cellist must be in the third house because the cricketer must be in the first house (since the cellist has to be to the right of the cricketer).

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

The basketball player must be in the first or third house. Since the cricketer is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house.

Therefore, the soccer player must be in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
5. The guitarist does not live in the third house.
6. The violinist does not live in the third house.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
8. The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we know:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

Since the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house (clue 4), and the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other (clue 10), the tennis player and the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

Since the violinist does not live in the third house (clue 6), the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer must be to the left of the guitarist, the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

So, the correct placement is:
- House 1: Milk drinker, Basketball player
- House 2: Violinist, Root beer lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Sure, let's think through this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses next to each other, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each house has a different flower arrangement and a different musical instrument.
3. The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other.
4. The pianist lives in house 2.

Since the pianist lives in house 2 and the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1.

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
   - House 4: Banana, SUV (since the person with the minivan is in House 4)

4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Apples, Daffodils

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

6. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

7. There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover and the soccer player are the same person in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and see where each person lives based on their sport, favorite color, and flowers in the foyer.

5. **Clue 11:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 4 or 5.

6. **Clue 9:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must be in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must be in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 5.

7. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 4.

8. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must be in House 3, and the swimmer must be in House 4.

9. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
   - Since the soccer player cannot be in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, so the soccer player must be in House 5, and the cricketer must be in House 1.

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Soccer, Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the violinist lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the computer must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Violinist and has a computer.
- House 2: Must be the bird keeper (since the violinist is in house 1 and the bird keeper is not in house 1).

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, we need to determine who is wearing running shoes. Since the cat lover is in House 1, the fish enthusiast must be in House 2 (wearing high heels), and the dog owner is in House 3, the only person left is the one in House 3, who is wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Kiwis
   - House 3: Blue

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Green

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis, Green

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in house 1 (Clue 2).
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 1). So, the history book buff must live in house 3.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television (Clue 4). This means the person with a television must live in house 2.
4. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (Clue 3). Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2.
5. The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only book type left is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The most expensive color in the world isn't necessarily blue. The cost of a color can depend on many things, like how rare it is or how it's made.

Other colors, like gold or silver, might be more expensive in some situations. So, blue isn't always the most expensive color."

Paul Bunyan is a giant from stories, known for cutting down huge trees and moving mountains.

If a Goblin shark had limbs, it could hypothetically ride a bike. While a Goblin shark is a deep-sea fish and not adapted for life on land, with limbs, it might be able to move in a similar way to how a person rides a bike.

A slingshot is not improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery can launch objects, they are very different. Artillery is a large, powerful weapon used in military operations, capable of firing heavy projectiles over long distances.

So, a slingshot would be correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon, but not as artillery."

Iris and Hermes would likely struggle at a UPS job. Iris, being a goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, is great at delivering messages quickly.

Both would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of UPS, which can be quite different from their mythological duties."

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can both be used to create strong passwords.

Binary numbers (which are just 0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet can be part of a strong password when combined with other types of characters. However, it's important to make sure the password is long (at least 12-16 characters) and random, and not based on easily guessable information like birthdays or common words."
"(A) No

Lunch on the beach is a nice way to relax, but it’s not the best place to see a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows usually appear as a semi-circle in the sky. To see a full circle, you would need to be in a very specific position where the sun is at a low angle and you are exactly opposite the sun. This is quite rare and not something you can easily achieve just by being on a beach. So, while it can be fun to look for rainbows, they won’t form a full circle there."

The iPhone is a very useful device that changed how people communicate and use technology, but it didn't start a new scientific revolution.

"(B) No

Handedness doesn't affect how you use American Sign Language. Whether you're right-handed or left-handed doesn't determine the signs you use or how you sign. ASL is a visual language, so it's about the hand movements and facial expressions you use to communicate, not which hand you write with."

For example, in the case of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989, the crash was caused by a mechanical failure, not by the airline's mistakes.
