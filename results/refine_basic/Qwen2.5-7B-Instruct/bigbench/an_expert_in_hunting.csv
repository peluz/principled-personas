"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4, as there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis
- House 2: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)
- House 3: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. Therefore, the percussionist must live in House 3.

- House 3: Percussionist

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover must be in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who has a television lives to the left of the root beer lover. Since the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who has a television must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

Finally, the cellist must be in House 3, as there is one house between the cellist and the person who has a gameboy.

- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Summarizing the placements:

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the positions.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house, so the tennis player and the person eating kiwis are the same person.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player, so the tea drinker is in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other, so the cricketer is in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer, so the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 or 2.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 4.

9. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
    - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

From the above clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Apples (Clue 9)
- House 2: Pizza (Clue 12, since the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, and the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 or 2)
- House 3: High heels (Clue 3)
- House 4: Mangos (Clue 12, since the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, 2, or 4, so the coffee drinker must be in house 3.
- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker is in house 3 and the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4).
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 (since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1 (since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 2 and the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The person who owns an SUV must be in house 2 (since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck is in house 1).
- The person who drives a truck must be in house 1.
- The person who ate fried rice must be in house 3 (since the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck is in house 1).
- The person who is a tea drinker must be in house 4 (since the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the tea drinker, and the person who drives a truck is in house 1).

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 4.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. This conflicts with clue 1, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. However, since the clues are consistent, we can assume the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese, which is house 5.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. Clue 5 tells us the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other (clue 7), and the person who had stew cannot be in the first house (clue 2), the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2 and 4**: The swimmer and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **Combining Clues 2 and 4**: The only way to satisfy both conditions is if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2 and the person eating oranges is in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the swimmer.

3. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges. Given the arrangement from Clue 2 and 4, the soccer player must be in house 1.

4. **Clue 3**: The person with the vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

### Assigning Sports and Fruits:
- House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
- House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

### Conclusion:
The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."

8. **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Starting with the known information:
- The violinist lives in the first house (Clue 7).

Using Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

Using Clue 2, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second or third house. Given that the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.

Using Clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. But the second house has the bouquet of daffodils, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

Using Clue 4, the mystery book reader lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

Using Clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Using Clue 5, there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a radio and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the second house.

Using Clue 8, the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

Summarizing the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house:
1. **First House:** Violinist, ate spaghetti, mystery book reader, has a radio.
2. **Second House:** Daffodils, ate pizza, has a vase of tulips, has a phone.
3. **Third House:** Percussionist, ate fried rice, science fiction book fanatic, has a television, history book buff.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

We need to place the fruits, pets, and devices:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From the clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

The person with the phone must be in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 is a history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff.

From these deductions:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff and is wearing boots, the person in house 1 must be the mystery book reader and is wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place each person in their respective houses step by step.

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 4, and the swimmer cannot be in House 3. The only possible positions are:
     - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4. The only possible positions are:
     - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
     - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - This confirms that the swimmer is in House 2 and the romance book lover is in House 3.

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."

"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a gameboy, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of the people in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct house for the cat lover:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Green, Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Radio, Fish enthusiast, Pizza

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, the person in house 1 must like green and be a fantasy book enthusiast. The person in house 2 has a radio and likes yellow (since the fish enthusiast cannot like green or yellow, and the only remaining color is yellow).

Thus, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast, likes yellow, and had pizza. The person in house 1 has a radio and likes green.

The cat lover must be in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
12. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
13. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
14. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.
16. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
17. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
18. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who owns horses must live in the first house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the fish enthusiast, and there is one house between them. Since the first house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the bird keeper must live in the first house and the fish enthusiast in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the root beer lover must live in the first house and the romance book lover in the second house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other, and there are two houses between the person who owns horses and the person who had pizza. Since the person who owns horses lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house, and the fantasy book enthusiast in the third house.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the third house is occupied by the fish enthusiast and the fourth house by the fantasy book enthusiast, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the tea drinker must live in the third house and the person who likes white in the fourth house.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, fruits, lunches, and flowers. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by organizing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place the characteristics step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the tulips must be in house 3, and so on.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils can only be in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other. Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio, and the first house must have the horses.

So, the first house has:
- Horses
- Phone
- Boots

The second house has:
- High heels
- Radio
- Horses (from clue 3, but already deduced)

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Let's assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, let's consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - So, House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - So, House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

6. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
7. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the answer.

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, and House 5 is the stew eater, the remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- **House 2: Apples eater**

From Clue 3 and Clue 7:
- The second house has a history book buff and daffodils.

From Clue 6:
- The third house has loafers.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4:
- The person who likes yellow cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house. This means the person in the second house who likes yellow is the history book buff.

From Clue 8:
- The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the second house, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 5:
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the second house (history book buff) and the daffodils are in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house. Therefore, the lilies must be in the third house.

From Clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing boots is in the first house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2. Given that the cricketer is in House 1 and the person who owns horses is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 2, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 3.

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 2.

18. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
19. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as follows:
1. House 1
2. House 2
3. House 3
4. House 4 (radio)
5. House 5

From Clue 15, the vase of tulips is to the right of the bouquet of daffodils. From Clue 16, the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils. This means the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house (Clue 3 and 12). Let's consider the possible positions for the bouquet of daffodils:

- If the bouquet of daffodils is in House 1, the rose bouquet is in House 2, and the vase of tulips is in House 2, 3, or 4. But the radio is in House 4, so the vase of tulips must be in House 3.
- If the bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1, and the vase of tulips is in House 3, 4, or 5. But the radio is in House 4, so the vase of tulips must be in House 5.
- If the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the rose bouquet is in House 4, and the vase of tulips is in House 4, 3, or 2. But the radio is in House 4, so the vase of tulips must be in House 3.

Since the vase of tulips must be to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, and the radio is in House 4, the only consistent position for the vase of tulips is House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is \boxed{3}."

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1 and see how the other clues fit:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Television, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

From the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses step by step.

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast

2. **Clue 1:** The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - House 2: History book buff

3. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - House 4: Eating banana

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Since the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person eating apples must live in either House 1 or House 2. However, House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so the person eating apples must live in House 1.

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - Since the person eating apples is in House 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 2, the person eating mangos must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3 and the banana eater is in House 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 4.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - The person eating apples is in House 1, and the person wearing boots must be in House 4, which is consistent with the previous placement.

Summarizing the placements:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic, eating banana

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues and the context provided, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above deductions:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the person in the second house must be wearing sandals (as the only other option left for the second house is sandals).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues step by step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4**: The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 6**: The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the person who only drinks water. Since they do not live in the first house, they must live in the second or third house. But since the third house is already occupied by the root beer lover, the only option is the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, let's use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The answer is:

(C) 3"

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow

- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 1, 2, or 4 (not 3).
- The person who is wearing running shoes must be to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

From Clue 12, we can deduce:
- The person who owns horses must be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person with a television must be to the right.

From Clue 16, we can deduce:
- The person who has a television must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

By analyzing all the clues and using the process of elimination, we can deduce that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the possible arrangements based on the clues:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

From Clue "
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This means House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses step by step.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only valid pair is (1, 3) or (2, 4). Given House 3 is taken, the pair must be (1, 3).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese is in House 4. This leaves us with:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only valid pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3.

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, so:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

### Combining the Clues:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the known information:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we can conclude that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 3 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes, the grilled cheese and white preferences must be in the second and third houses.
- Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- Clue 5 tells us that the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.
- Clue 2 tells us that the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.
- Clue 4 tells us that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is consistent.

3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if pizza is in House 2, blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

   - This means if mangos are in House 2, red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if truck is in House 2, lilies are in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 2, red must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues and the context provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes white.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues and the context of the houses and their occupants, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in House 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1, as it is to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the mystery book reader is in House 2, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (Clue 5).
2. The root beer lover lives in the second house (Clue 3).
3. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk (Clue 2). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 1). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker, so the blue person must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (Clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the second house (Clue 6).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the left of the third house). So, the basketball player must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the cat lover must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the person who likes green cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the person who likes green must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the person who likes blue is in the second house (Clue 6), the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.
- The basketball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1. This means the person who is eating oranges is the basketball player.
- The cat lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 2), so they must be in house 2 or 3.
- The dog owner cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so they must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who likes green cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in house 2 or 3.

From the above deductions, we can place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 5, and the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.

2. **The person who owns horses lives in the first house.**
   - Horse owner: House 1.

3. **The root beer lover does not live in the first house.**
   - Root beer lover: Houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

5. **There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the pianist are 2 houses apart.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

15. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.**
    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

From clue 16, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who likes milk is in house 3. From clue 8, the guitarist is in house 3, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker is in house 5, and the tennis player is in house 4.

From clue 15, the fish enthusiast is in house 5, and the swimmer is in house 3.

From clue 6, the pianist is in house 3, and the bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 4, the flutist is in house 5, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 7, the guitarist is in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice is in house 3, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 18, the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 3:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Given that the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house (Clue 7), we can start placing other characteristics around this known point.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5, with one house between them.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

From Clue 13, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be two houses apart. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the dog owner cannot live in house 1, so the dog owner must live in house 2.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place the characteristics step by step:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone must be in House 2 and the SUV in House 4.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4 (since House 4 is the only house to the right of House 3).

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already taken by the minivan, so the convertible must be in House 2.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

Now, let's summarize the placements:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone and Convertible
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer
- House 4: SUV and Radio

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since the computer is in the second house, the phone must be in the first house and the television in the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the phone is in the first house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. But the third house is already occupied by the vase of tulips, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth or fifth house.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. Since the radio cannot be in the fourth or fifth house (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), the radio must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first and second houses are occupied by the phone and computer, respectively, so the radio must be in the third house. This means the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fourth or fifth house.
6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the fifth house is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, the rose bouquet must be in the fourth house, and the carnations arrangement must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

9. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
10. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in House 2.

From Clue 4, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. This means the person eating grapes lives in House 1 and the person with a computer lives in House 2.

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a computer).

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5 and Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1:
- The person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6:
- The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7:
- The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9:
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5:
- There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - Let's denote the house with grapes as G and the house with daffodils as D. G and D are 2 houses apart.

6. **Clue 17**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

7. **Clue 18**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

8. **Clue 14**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - Let's denote the house with carnations as C and the house with the cricketer as Ck. C and Ck are next to each other.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1, the person with lilies must be the golfer. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the soccer player in house 3 has daffodils, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the person with tulips must be the basketball player in house 2.

Summarizing:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics.

4. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 4).

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

6. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 6**: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
10. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's start placing the remaining characteristics:
- Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

The answer is (C) 3."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the context provided, let's deduce the correct house for the dog owner:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person in the second house cannot like white.

From clue 2, the root beer lover must be to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses cannot be in the second house (as the root beer lover would then be to the left of the horse owner, which is not possible), the person who owns horses must be in the first house.

This means:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the dog owner cannot be in the second house (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."

7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Fried Rice
  - House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. Since the violinist cannot be in house 4, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils

From clue 5, since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and we know the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From clue 6, since the dog owner lives to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3.

From clue 8, since the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (from Clue 7), and the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3), the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

The person who likes red must be in House 3 (since the person who likes red is next to the person who is wearing loafers, and the only remaining house is House 3).

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

From Clue 1, since the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house (because there is one house between them).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house (since the person with lilies is in the second house and must be to the right of the person with tulips).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only drink left is water, and the only flower left is a rose bouquet. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is:
(B) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the tennis player is in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the pizza eater cannot be in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the fried rice eater is to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house, confirming the history book buff is in the third house and ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the green lover must be in the first or second house. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the green lover must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, the devices, the flowers, and the sports. Let's break it down step by step.

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).
  - Clue 2: The golfer (house 3) is not in the second house.
  - Clue 3: The computer (house 1) and vase of tulips (house 2) are next to each other.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house number for each characteristic. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The swimmer lives in the third house.**
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. **The violinist lives in the second house.**
   - Violinist: House 2

6. **The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

7. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. **The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:

- From Clue 1, the swimmer is in House 3.
- From Clue 5, the violinist is in House 2.
- From Clue 9, the cricketer is in House 4.
- From Clue 11, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5.

Since the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other, and the basketball player is to the left of the guitarist, and the guitarist is to the right of the violinist (House 2), the basketball player must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2 (but this contradicts the violinist being in House 2). So, the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 6, the basketball player (House 3) is directly left of the guitarist (House 4), which is consistent.

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2
- Violinist: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Grilled cheese

Since each person has a different pet, and we know the fish enthusiast (House 2), the person in House 1 must be the dog owner.

Now, we need to determine what the person in House 1 ate for lunch. We know:
- House 1: High heels, Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the person in House 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in House 1 must have eaten stew (the only other option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

- House 2: Dog owner, Horses (since the horse owner is in the second house)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: (to be determined)
- House 5: Romance book lover

Next, we use the clues to fill in the remaining details:

- Clue 6: The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner, which is already satisfied.
- Clue 7: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, which is already satisfied.
- Clue 8: There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the vase of tulips must be in the third house.

- Clue 11: The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the red lover must be in the fourth house.
- Clue 12: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

- Clue 13: The person who owns horses lives in the second house, which is already satisfied.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Dog owner, Horses
- House 3: History book buff, Blue, Tulips, Lilies
- House 4: White, Blue, Bird keeper, Red
- House 5: Romance book lover

The cat lover must be in the second house, as the only pet left is a cat, and the second house is the only one left for the cat lover.

Therefore, the cat lover lives in house number \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clues 2, 4, and 6, we can conclude that the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. **Clue 9**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

10. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

14. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
15. **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person who is wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, the person who has a radio does not live in the second house, so the person who has a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- Clue 2 and Clue 6: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses. So, the sequence is: pizza, yellow, tea.

- Clue 7: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the orange eater.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"

   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses step by step.

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist is in the third house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the only house left for the person wearing loafers is the first house.

Now, let's assign the drinks based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the person in the first house cannot be the milk drinker. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader does not live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know that the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. From Clue 3, the person with running shoes is not in the third house, so the only possible positions are:
- House 1: Running shoes, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Rose bouquet

From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

From Clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the person with sandals. This means:
- If the person with sandals is in House 3, the person with carnations is in House 2.
- If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 3.

From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew. This means:
- If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
- If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
- If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
- If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:
- If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
- If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
- If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
- If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
- If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
- If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the left house (House 1).
2. The person with the lilies lives in the right house (House 2).
3. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- House 1 has a rose bouquet and the person eating mangos.
- House 2 has lilies and the saxophonist (since the saxophonist cannot live in House 1).

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.

Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 14**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

11. **Clue 11**: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover next to each other. Let's consider the possible pairs:

- If the person with a rose bouquet is in House 2, then the person who likes milk must be in House 3.
- If the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 2, then the root beer lover must be in House 3.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Let's use Clue 8 to place the person who only drinks water:

- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Let's use Clue 5 to place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the second or third house. The swimmer must be in the first or third house. Given the constraints, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is already occupied by the yellow lover, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1, and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations and House 3 has yellow, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 3 has yellow, the horses and blue must be in House 2 or House 1. But House 2 already has the vase of tulips, so the horses and blue must be in House 1 and House 2.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

Given the constraints:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Tulips (since it's next to the bird keeper and not yellow or rose)
- House 3: Yellow

The bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist. Clue 3 tells us that the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes red. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person in house 1 must like green, and the person in house 2 must like red.

Therefore, the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader (since the only remaining book type is mystery) and likes red.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3 or 4. Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2 and the person who is wearing loafers in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer:

1. The golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From clue 2, we know the golfer is in house 2. From clue 3, the history book buff is in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the science fiction book fanatic and the swimmer.

Since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 1.

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who owns horses must be in House 4:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Finally, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

From Clue 2, we know the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff.

Now, using Clue 1:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and owns horses.

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Wearing sandals, owns horses, ate spaghetti, and is a history book buff.
- House 2: Wearing running shoes, owns a cat, ate fried rice, and is a romance book lover.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
4. **Clue 6 (revisited):** The person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, so the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

From Clue 8, since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Next, let's use Clue 4:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 5:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Finally, let's use Clue 7:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Now, let's use Clue 9:
- There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the clues, let's deduce the positions step by step:

- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the other clues, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

Now, the person who likes blue must live in House 1 or 3. Since the person who likes white must live in a position that allows the person who likes yellow to be one house away, and considering the placement of the other clues, the person who likes white must live in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct house number for the basketball player step by step.

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

15. **Clue 15:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From Clue 1, the computer must be in house 1 and the root beer lover in house 2.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and they are next to each other).

From Clue 7, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3, so it must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 13, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3).

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the cellist. So the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

From Clue 2, the cellist must be in house 5.

From Clue 6, the percussionist must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the phone and the television. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5 (since the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 8, there is one house between the cellist and the guitarist. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 12, the root beer lover (house 2) lives to the left of the percussionist (house 5).

From Clue 10, the coffee drinker (house 3) lives to the right of the milk drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).

From Clue 11, the guitarist (house 3) lives to the right of the phone (house 1).

From Clue 16, the tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), the tea drinker is in house 1 and the pianist is in house 5.

From Clue 9, the cellist does not live in house 4, so the cellist is in house 5.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the phone and house 2 is the root beer lover, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."

Thus, the person who drives a minivan (MV) lives in **House 4**.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, devices, cars, flowers, and pets. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.

16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in House 5.

From Clue 17, there is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

By analyzing the clues and the possible positions, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the truck must be in House 3, and the convertible must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the context provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing the high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- House 2: Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person in the first house, who is a history book buff, a cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)

- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they are in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the pianist and the kiwi-eater must be in adjacent houses, and the violinist and the kiwi-eater must be two houses apart. The only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be to the right of the violinist, so the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.

- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we know the root beer lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, since the pianist lives directly left of the cellist, and considering the houses are numbered 1 and 2, the only possible arrangement is that the pianist lives in the first house and the cellist lives in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in House 4:
- House 4: Boots
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already occupied by boots, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5:
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 3, the person wearing sandals cannot be in House 5, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person wearing sandals must be in House 1:
- House 1: Sandals

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since House 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied, the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Running Shoes
- House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

From Clue 5, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Since House 4 is already occupied by the vase of tulips, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2:
- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 8, the person with the bouquet of daffodils (House 2) and the person wearing running shoes (House 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 6, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) does not live in the fourth house, which is consistent with our arrangement.

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3:
- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.
- **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the tea drinker.
- **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the house immediately to the left of the person who likes white.
- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.
- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.
- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.
- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.
- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.
3. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house (since the fantasy book enthusiast would not be to the left of the science fiction book fanatic). Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.
4. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Given the above, let's place the known elements:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Since the romance book lover must be to the right of the carnations arrangement and directly left of the vase of tulips, and the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house (as the fantasy book enthusiast is there), it must be in the second house. This places the romance book lover in the third house and the vase of tulips in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues and the context provided:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1. Since the coffee drinker must live to the left of the person wearing sandals, and House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1. This means the person in House 2 is wearing sandals.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2 has a convertible.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means if the sedan is in house 3, the yellow is in house 2, but house 2 already has the convertible. Therefore, the sedan must be in house 3, and the yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan is in house 3, the white must be in house 1 or house 2. But house 1 already has the yellow, so the white must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: White
- House 3: Sedan

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house, so the dog owner must live in the first, second, or fourth house.
From clue 4, the sandals are to the left of the bird keeper, so the sandals must be in the first, second, or third house, and the bird keeper must be in the second, third, or fourth house.
From clue 5, the bird keeper is two houses to the right of the person wearing running shoes, so the bird keeper must be in the third or fourth house.
From clue 6, the high heels are not in the fourth house, so the high heels must be in the first, second, or third house.
From clue 7, the fish enthusiast is to the right of the person who owns an SUV, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth or fifth house.
From clue 8, the fish enthusiast is not in the third house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 10, the loafers are not in the fifth house, so the loafers must be in the first, second, or third house.
From clue 11, the fish enthusiast is not in the fifth house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.
From clue 12, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must be in the second, third, or fourth house.
From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives to the right of the person who drives a minivan, so the minivan must be in the first, second, or third house, and the horses must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

Given the constraints, let's place the characteristics:

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Sandals, not high heels, not truck (must be dog owner, fish enthusiast, or bird keeper)
- House 3: Sedan, not dog owner, not fish enthusiast (must be truck, minivan)
- House 4: Bird keeper, not high heels (must be dog owner, cat lover, or fish enthusiast)
- House 5: Not fish enthusiast, not loafers, not minivan (must be dog owner, cat lover, or SUV)

From clue 9, the high heels are in House 2, and the truck is in House 3.
From clue 11, the fish enthusiast is in House 4.
From clue 12, the dog owner must be in House 2.
From clue 13, the minivan must be in House 3, and the horses must be in House 4 or 5.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) 3**"
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic and the fantasy book enthusiast are already accounted for, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water (because the person in house 2 cannot be drinking water as per clue 1).

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals as per clue 2).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in House 1, and the person with a television must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

The person eating kiwis must be in the house that is not accounted for by the other characteristics. Since House 1 has high heels, sandals, and tea drinker, and House 2 has grapes and television, the only fruit left is kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's place the information:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, we know:
  - House 1: Tea drinker

- The violinist cannot be in house 3, and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist. This means the violinist and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

- From Clue 1, the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist. This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the water drinker must be in house 2 or 3 if the cellist is in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Let's test the possibilities:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This means the cellist must be in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This would place the water drinker in house 3. This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3)
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker (from Clue 1)

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who only drinks water.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who had pizza:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. Given Clue 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

With the bird keeper in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 1 (as they live to the right of the bird keeper).

Thus, the pizza eater must be in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Given that the cat lover lives in the first house, we can start by placing the cat lover in House 1.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the information:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people and their corresponding fruits and favorite colors.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

Starting with Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

Using Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can deduce:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

From Clue 2 and Clue 5, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3.

Using Clue 4:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

This means the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

Using Clue 1:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

Using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 2 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given Clue 1, we know:
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

Given Clue 2, we know:
- The cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in house 1 and the cat lover in house 2.

Given Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The person with a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person with a television lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

From clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Water drinker

From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in either the first or third house. However, clue 5 states that the person with the television lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the vase of tulips is in the first house, the television must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses. Given that the first house has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

2. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

From Clue 3, the golfer and the baseball player must be next to each other. Since the baseball player is in the third house, the golfer must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be next to each other. Since the golfer is in the second house, the person with carnations must be in the first house, and the person with horses must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player. This is consistent with our current arrangement.

From Clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with daffodils. Since the person with horses is in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person with daffodils must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who drives a truck must be in House 2, as the person driving a convertible is in House 3.

- House 2: Mangos, Convertible
- House 3: Horses, Truck

Now, we need to place the remaining occupants and their pets and cars:

- House 1: Oranges, Bird Keeper (since the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner, and the dog owner cannot be in House 3)
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible, Dog Owner (since the dog owner cannot be in House 3 and the bird keeper is in House 1)
- House 3: Horses, Truck

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the clues and making logical deductions:

1. **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. **Clue 4:** There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
7. **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.

9. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the romance book lover:
- From Clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- From Clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first or last house. The only possible arrangement is:
  - Mystery book reader in house 1, Romance book lover in house 3, History book buff in house 4.

Next, we place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.
- From Clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the first house.
- From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.

Given these constraints, the only possible arrangement for the percussionist and the guitarist is:
- Guitarrist in house 2, Percussionist in house 3, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Now, we place the remaining people and their preferences:
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. The only remaining houses are 4 and 5. Since the person who had stew is in house 4, the saxophonist must be in house 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Flutist
4. Stew
5. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.
7. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
8. The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. The person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
10. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover.
11. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
12. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
13. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
14. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
15. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.
16. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
17. The person who likes white does not live in the fourth house.
18. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in House 3. From Clue 10, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

Now, let's use Clue 15 and Clue 14:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.

This means:
- House 2: Grapes, Romance book lover.
- House 3: Romance book lover.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Green.

From Clue 7, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the mystery book reader must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the romance book lover. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 2.

From Clue 13, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the person who drives a convertible must be in House 1.

From Clue 14, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is grilled cheese, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3. From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, we need to deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the answer.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the two people who like root beer and the one who likes guitar must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house. This means the dog owner can only be in house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3, as there is no house to the right of house 3. Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 1.
3. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3. If the bird keeper were in house 3, there would be no house to the right of house 3, so the bird keeper must be in house 2. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

Given these deductions:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangos

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Mangos
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in the first house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff must be in the third house because the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 3, the romance book lover cannot be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who owns horses cannot be in the third house, so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

So, the romance book lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

From clue 3 and clue 4, the person who is eating mangos cannot live in the first or third house, so they must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person who is eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this needs to be re-evaluated.

From clue 6, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first or fourth house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who is eating apples, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

So, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. Mangos

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."

9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, which means there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the clues.

Given clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, which is already confirmed.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, let's use Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, let's use Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, let's use Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, let's use Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, let's use Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From Clue 5 and Clue 6, we can deduce the following:
- The minivan must be in house 3 because the flutist is directly left of the minivan, and the minivan must be to the right of the truck.

From Clue 2 and Clue 5:
- The truck and gameboy must be in adjacent houses, and the minivan must be to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck is in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the minivan in house 3.

From Clue 3:
- The minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in house 2.

From Clue 6:
- The flutist is directly left of the minivan, so the flutist must be in house 1.

From Clue 4:
- The high heels and television are adjacent. Since the cellist has the television, the high heels must be with the percussionist.

From Clue 7:
- The boots are to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in house 3.

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist (with the television)
- House 3: Percussionist (with the high heels)

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The question asks for the house number where the person who is eating apples lives. Based on the given clues, the person eating apples lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 4"
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - The coffee drinker must be in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - The SUV owner must be in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must be in House 3, because the SUV owner is in House 1 and the person with the rose bouquet is in House 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - The truck driver cannot be in House 1, and the minivan owner cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - The root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the truck driver must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the SUV owner is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the SUV owner is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.
- The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given these clues, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues and the setup of the houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly places the bird keeper in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly places the horse owner in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly places the grilled cheese eater in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The only remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

- From Clue 3, the basketball player and the tennis player must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 4, the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing loafers must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 5, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza must be in consecutive houses.

2. The basketball player and the tennis player must be in consecutive houses.
3. The person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing loafers must be in consecutive houses.

- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese (from Clue 8 and Clue 10)
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti (from Clue 4 and Clue 5)
- House 4: Person who had pizza (from Clue 5)

Now, we need to fit the remaining characteristics:

- The root beer lover and the person wearing high heels must be in consecutive houses (Clue 2).
- The basketball player and the tennis player must be in consecutive houses (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing boots must be to the left of the basketball player (Clue 13).

- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who had pizza
- House 5: Person who had stew

Thus, the tea drinker lives in House 4.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in house \( n \), the person who had pizza is in house \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - The tea drinker is in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - The coffee drinker is in a house to the left of the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White
- House 3: Daffodils

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

3. **House 3**: (Sedan/Truck, Lilies)
4. **House 4**: (Soccer player, Cat lover, Stew, Truck/Minivan)

From Clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 2 and the tennis player in House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the tennis player in House 3, the minivan must be in House 2 and the convertible in House 3.

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. Since the minivan is in House 2 and the convertible in House 3, the sedan must be in House 3 and the truck in House 4.

From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Since the soccer player is in House 4, the lilies must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. Since the cat lover is in House 4, the fried rice eater must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the rose bouquet cannot be in House 2 (Clue 14) and the sedan is in House 3, the rose bouquet must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the soccer player in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 3.

From Clue 12 and 13, the first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti.

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."

   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist lives in the second house.

These two clues seem contradictory, so we need to interpret them correctly. Since a person cannot be both a basketball player and a violinist, we need to consider the characteristics (instrument or sport) separately.

From clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house. This means the basketball player cannot be the violinist. Therefore, the basketball player must be in either the first or third house.

From clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, as there is no house to the right of the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must be in the first house.

If the cricketer is in the first house, the cellist must be in the third house (since the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer).

This leaves the second house for the violinist and the basketball player. Since the violinist is already in the second house, the basketball player must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Basketball player

The soccer player must be in the first house, as the other characteristics (violinist and basketball player) are already assigned to the second and third houses.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics correctly for each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
5. The guitarist does not live in the third house.
6. The violinist does not live in the third house.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
8. The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1. Given the clues, since the pianist lives in house 2 and the person with the daffodils lives next to the pianist, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics correctly in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the root beer lover step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses based on their sports, favorite colors, and flowers in the foyer. Let's go through the clues step by step:

2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

From Clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Since the soccer player cannot live in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, so the soccer player must live in House 5, and the cricketer must live in House 1.

- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Soccer, Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Given the positions of the tea drinker and the person who likes blue, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses. Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must be in the second house, and the person who likes green must be in the third house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house. Given that the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples are in the first and second houses, the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues and the context of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular, and often jerky movements. These symptoms would make it extremely challenging for a person to perform the precise and controlled movements required in a ballet competition. Therefore, someone with this condition would likely not win such a competition."
"(A) No

Pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use human languages, including Pig Latin. This is because Pig Latin is a human language game that requires an understanding of linguistic rules, which pigs do not possess. Pigs communicate through a variety of sounds and body language, but they cannot learn or use human languages like Pig Latin."

Ringo Starr, being a fan of various cuisines, would likely not avoid pot roast at a restaurant unless he had a specific dietary restriction or personal preference against it. There's no indication that he would avoid this dish."
"(A) No

The Olympiastadion Berlin, which hosted events during the 1936 Summer Olympics, had a seating capacity of around 100,000 spectators. While this capacity is impressive, it is not sufficient to accommodate the modern Super Bowl crowd. The Super Bowl typically draws a much larger audience, both in terms of stadium attendance and television viewership, often exceeding 100,000 people. Therefore, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would not be large enough for a Super Bowl crowd."
"(B) Yes

While I am an expert in hunting, it's important to clarify that the term ""brown rock fish"" is not a specific scientific name but rather a general description. The waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis are known to have a diverse range of fish species. Some species that might fit the description of a ""brown rock fish"" could be found in the region, particularly in rocky areas. However, without specific identification, it's challenging to pinpoint exact species. Therefore, based on the general biodiversity of the area, it is reasonable to conclude that brown rock fish could be found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which can involve managing the environment to avoid bee activity. This might still necessitate some interaction with the plants and potentially with insects, which could be distressing for someone with a fear of insects."
"(A) Yes

If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would run out of theses well before half a year. Given that he wrote 95 theses in total, he would exhaust his theses after 95 days, which is significantly less than half a year (182.5 days)."

Both waltz and slam dance are physical activities that can vary in their potential for injury. Waltz is a more controlled dance, while slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled movements. However, the risk of injury in either activity depends on factors such as skill level, environment, and specific movements performed. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that waltz is less injurious than slam dance."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny would not be suitable for making silverware. The composition of the 1943-S penny, which is primarily an alloy of copper, silver, and manganese, makes it unsuitable for use in silverware. Silverware requires a high purity of silver to meet quality and hygiene standards, and using coins for such purposes would be impractical and potentially illegal."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to the planet's extreme surface temperature and atmospheric conditions. The surface temperature is around 462°C (864°F), which is far too hot for any snowboarding equipment or human to survive. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's, making it challenging to move around. The atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating an inhospitable environment for any activity, including snowboarding."
"(B) No

Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not involved in the Battle of Tours. The battle is more closely associated with Charles Martel, Pepin's father, who led the Frankish forces to victory against the Umayyad Muslims in 732 AD."

In most corporate settings, including those of multinational companies like Nissan, workers typically use Western-style utensils such as forks and knives for dining. While chopsticks are common in Japanese culture, they are not the standard dining utensils used in corporate headquarters."
"(B) No

Hermes, the Greek god associated with commerce, communication, travelers, and thieves, does not correspond to Vulcan. Instead, Hermes is equivalent to Mercury in Roman mythology. Vulcan, on the other hand, is the Roman god of fire and metalworking, corresponding to the Greek god Hephaestus."
"(A) No

Ariana Grande is a public figure known for her music and performances, but she has not publicly disclosed any specific experiences or diagnoses related to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Therefore, she would not typically be a relevant topic in a presentation specifically about PTSD."
"The answer is (B) Yes.

Jack Black and Bear McCreary operate in entirely different domains. Jack Black is primarily known for his work in acting, comedy, and music, while Bear McCreary is a renowned composer known for his work in film and television scores. It is highly unlikely that they would compete for the same award, as their fields of expertise and the awards they typically receive are distinct. Therefore, Jack Black is unlikely to compete with Bear McCreary for an award."

""Rick and Morty"" contains mature themes and content that could be triggering for children of alcoholics or anyone dealing with the effects of alcoholism. The show's dark humor, complex moral and ethical dilemmas, and sometimes disturbing or violent content might be particularly sensitive for individuals or families affected by alcoholism. Parents or guardians should be aware of the content and consider its appropriateness for children."

Euphoria can indeed be associated with drug addiction. Many substances used in hunting, such as stimulants or pain relievers, can induce a state of euphoria. This rewarding feeling is a key factor in the initial use and can contribute to the development of addiction. However, addiction is a complex issue influenced by various factors beyond just the experience of euphoria."
"(A) No

While Apollo from Greek mythology is a god with numerous divine abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and other supernatural powers, D'Artagnan from ""The Three Musketeers"" is a skilled human swordsman. In a direct physical confrontation, Apollo's divine powers would likely give him an advantage over a single D'Artagnan. However, if we consider multiple D'Artagnan figures, the outcome would depend on the number and skill level of the D'Artagnans. Given the vast array of abilities and divine support Apollo could command, it is unlikely that a single D'Artagnan could defeat Apollo, making the answer (A) No."
"(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Melanoma, the type of skin cancer he suffered from, is often linked to sun exposure. While Bob Marley's melanoma developed on his foot, which is less exposed to the sun, sunscreen can still be beneficial in protecting other parts of the skin from UV radiation. Therefore, it remains an important tool in preventing skin cancers."
"(B) No

The French Defense, characterized by the moves 1.e4 e6, is a solid opening for Black aimed at controlling the center and developing pieces. It does not defend against a four-move checkmate, which typically occurs in the opening moves with 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5+ g6 3.Qf3+ Qf6 4.Qxf6#. This sequence is known as Fool's Mate and is not a position that arises from the French Defense."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is used in water treatment to kill harmful microorganisms, but it must be properly managed to ensure it is safe for consumption. If the water has not been allowed to sit long enough for the chlorine to dissipate to safe levels, it can still contain harmful concentrations that are toxic and can cause health issues. Always follow local guidelines and water treatment procedures to ensure the water is safe to drink."
"(B) No

A dichromat, or someone with color vision deficiency, would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color. Both gases are colorless, so a dichromat would not have any color-based cues to differentiate them."

"(A) No

Sea turtles in the wild continue to face numerous challenges such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change, which are not alleviated by human quarantine measures. Even in protected areas, they still encounter natural and environmental threats. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine."
"The answer is (B) No.

Jesus lived in a time and context very different from our modern world. The Easter Bunny is a relatively recent addition to Easter celebrations, originating in Germanic and later German-American traditions. Given that Jesus lived around 2,000 years ago, he would not have been familiar with the concept of the Easter Bunny. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny."
"(A) No

An elephant would not easily defeat a male macaque. Despite the significant size and strength difference, a macaque would likely use its agility and natural instincts to avoid or minimize direct conflict with an elephant. Elephants are much larger and stronger, but they are not typically aggressive towards smaller primates unless there is a specific threat. In most scenarios, the macaque would find ways to avoid confrontation."
"(A) No

Augustus was not his real name. He was born Gaius Octavius and adopted the name Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus after being adopted by Julius Caesar. He later took the name Augustus, which became his recognized name."
"(A) No

The Confederate States of America, during the Civil War, spoke Modern English, not Old English. Old English was used long before the 15th century and would have been completely outdated by the time of the Civil War."
"(A) Yes

Given Robert Wadlow's height of 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72 meters) and the typical height of a German Shepherd ranging from 22.5 to 28 inches (57 to 66 to 71 cm), it is clear that Robert Wadlow would easily tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not beneficial to one's health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ethanol was beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the specific material, process, and application. For instance, certain pigments like lapis lazuli, historically used in ultramarine, have been extremely expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in certain applications. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(B) No

As an expert in hunting, it's important to consider the physical and practical aspects of the scenario. Ryan Crouser, while an extremely strong athlete, would not throw a Bengal fox with ease. The act of throwing a small animal like a Bengal fox (which typically weighs between 4.4 to 11 pounds) is not a common or practical action for a hunter or athlete. Additionally, such an action would be unsafe and not in line with ethical hunting practices. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."
"(B) Yes

Under Lord Voldemort's rules, students at Hogwarts would not be allowed to have dark marks, which are a clear sign of allegiance to him. Therefore, Voldemort himself would have been barred from Hogwarts based on his own criteria."
"(A) No

Both The Jackson 5 and The Isley Brothers were family bands, but The Isley Brothers originally consisted of five members (O'Kelly Isley, Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley, Vernon Isley, and Odessa Isley). While The Jackson 5 had five members as well, the term ""bigger family band"" isn't strictly accurate since both bands were family-based. Therefore, it's not correct to say that one was definitively bigger or more of a family band than the other."
"(A) Yes

Lactobacillus is beneficial for making pickles, as it helps in the fermentation process, producing lactic acid that gives pickles their characteristic flavor and aids in preservation. While it's possible to rely on natural lactobacillus, using a starter culture can ensure better control and consistency in the pickling process."
"(A) No

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred in the context of early 20th-century financial markets and did not impact industries that emerged much later. Robotics companies, as we understand them today, did not exist in 1929. Therefore, the crash would not have affected their stocks."
"(A) No

Moon Jae-in, the former President of South Korea, was born in Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Khanbaliq, the historical name for Beijing, China, is not relevant to his place of birth."
"(B) Yes

A person with Anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person due to the severe weight loss and nutritional deficiencies that weaken bones. This condition often leads to osteoporosis or osteopenia, making the bones more fragile and prone to fractures."
"(B) No

Sea shanties were songs used by sailors on ships, not by travelers on the Oregon Trail. The Oregon Trail was a land route used by settlers moving westward, and they would have sung songs more relevant to their journey, such as ballads about home, family, or the challenges of the trail."
"(A) Yes

Shooting a bald eagle is a serious offense due to its protected status under federal law. The penalties for such an act can include significant prison time, fines, and other legal consequences. In comparison, Michael Vick's dogfighting case resulted in a 23-month prison sentence. Therefore, under the right circumstances, shooting a bald eagle could indeed result in more prison time than Michael Vick's sentence."
"(B) No

Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, well before the invention of television. Bonanza, the television show in question, first aired in 1959. Therefore, Gandhi could not have watched Bonanza."
"(A) No

"(B) No

Given the stark differences in their beliefs and backgrounds, it is highly unlikely that Jacques Duèze and Richard Dawkins would have been friends. Duèze was a Roman Catholic priest with conservative views, while Dawkins is a prominent atheist and evolutionary biologist. Their philosophical and religious differences would have made it difficult for them to share common interests or form a friendship."
"(B) No

Hiding a pet macaque under a desk is not feasible or advisable. Macaques are wild animals that require specific living conditions, including adequate space, social interaction, and environmental enrichment. Keeping a macaque as a pet is often illegal and can be harmful to the animal's well-being. It is not safe or legal to confine such an animal in a small space like under a desk."
"(B) No

Justin Bieber is a well-known musician and does not have any political aspirations or background that would suggest he would run for or take over Mike Pence's position in 2020. Mike Pence was the Vice President of the United States, and the 2020 election did not involve Justin Bieber as a candidate."
"(A) No

YouTube viewers typically do not receive unsolicited audiobook advice frequently. The platform's recommendation algorithms focus on video content and viewer behavior, rather than promoting specific products like audiobooks. Such recommendations are more likely to come from other sources."

Alcatraz Island is significantly smaller than the space required for a full-sized football field. The island measures about 220 yards by 420 yards, while a standard American football field, including end zones, is 360 feet by 160 feet. Given these dimensions, it would not be possible to fit a football field on the island without leaving large portions unused or overlapping."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable ingredient for a White Russian. The cocktail's flavors of vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream are well-balanced and traditional. Adding kaffir lime would likely introduce an unwanted and disruptive flavor profile."
"(A) Yes

A Goblin shark, if it had limbs, could hypothetically ride a bike. While it is a deep-sea fish and not adapted for life on land, the primary challenge would be the adaptation of its anatomy rather than the fundamental ability to ride a bike. If it could develop limbs and other necessary physical and cognitive adaptations, it would be capable of riding a bike."
"(B) Yes

Kurt Cobain's music, which was part of the grunge genre, has indeed continued to influence and be present in the music world after his death.

"(B) No

A spice grinder can still be useful for grinding even the cheapest cinnamon sticks. The price of the cinnamon does not significantly affect the functionality of the grinder. While the quality and flavor of the cinnamon might be compromised with cheaper varieties, the grinder will still effectively break down the sticks into smaller pieces, which can be beneficial for various culinary applications."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are used to launch projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational principles. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military applications, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. Slingshots, on the other hand, are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with the specific tasks involved in a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excelled in swift and efficient communication but her role didn't involve the physical aspects of package delivery. Hermes, known for his speed and cunning, while useful in certain aspects, also had roles that didn't align with the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job. Their mythological attributes and personalities might make them less suited to the detailed and professional requirements of a UPS job."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, which consists mainly of cookies, does not align with the principles of the Paleo diet. The Paleo diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods such as meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, while avoiding processed foods and grains. Cookies are highly processed and often contain grains, making them unsuitable for a Paleo-friendly diet."

Lactic acid is a natural byproduct of muscle metabolism and is not inherently bad. It builds up during intense physical activity when your muscles are working harder than they can aerobically support. This is a normal part of the body's energy production process. After the activity, the body typically clears the lactic acid. While high levels of lactic acid can indicate certain medical conditions, this is not a normal state and is usually associated with underlying health issues rather than normal bodily functions."
"(A) No

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to assassinate King James I and the members of the English Parliament by blowing up the Houses of Parliament.

"(B) No

While both bull sharks and crocodiles are capable of delivering powerful and painful bites, the force and impact of a crocodile's bite generally exceed that of a bull shark. Crocodiles can exert a tremendous amount of pressure, often over 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), which is significantly higher than the 1,000 psi of a bull shark's bite. This makes a crocodile bite more painful and potentially more damaging."
"(A) No

The story of Snow White does not illustrate good consent.

In the context of the ""Simpsons"" universe, it is entirely plausible for Bart Simpson to own comics featuring The Joker. The show often incorporates various pop culture references, including comic book characters, into its episodes and storylines. While Bart's typical comic collection is more aligned with the ""Simpsons"" universe, the show has not strictly limited his ownership to only those comics. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Bart could own comics featuring The Joker."
"(A) Yes

To provide a more detailed explanation, 50 Cent and Jeffrey Atkins (also known as Method Man) are both prominent figures in the music industry, particularly in hip-hop.

They have collaborated on music projects and have been seen supporting each other's endeavors, which suggests they maintain a positive relationship."
"(A) No

In Somalia, the application of Sharia law and local customs can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific circumstances. A celibate cleric is unlikely to face a stoning unless they are accused of a crime that would warrant such a punishment, such as adultery. Given that celibacy is a state of being unmarried and abstaining from sexual activity, it is highly improbable that a celibate cleric would be accused of adultery. Therefore, the likelihood of a celibate cleric suffering a stoning in Somalia is low."
"(B) Yes

John Kerry did not participate in the 2010 United Kingdom general election. He is a U.S. political figure and has no connection to UK electoral politics."
"(A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password. A strong password typically requires a mix of different character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can be used to increase the complexity and strength of a password when combined with other character types. However, it's crucial to ensure the password is long (at least 12-16 characters), random, and not based on easily guessable information to maximize security."
"(A) No

Spotting a full circle of a rainbow is not a common or easily achievable activity, especially while having lunch on a beach. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed under specific conditions where the sun is at a low angle (below about 42 degrees) and the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point. These conditions are rare and not easily met by simply being on a beach. Therefore, while enjoying lunch on the beach can be a pleasant experience, it is not a good strategy for observing a full circle of a rainbow."
"(A) Yes

"(B) Yes

Pancakes are not a suitable snack for cats. As an expert in hunting, I understand the dietary needs of carnivorous animals like cats. Their diet should primarily consist of meat, which provides the necessary nutrients and proteins they need. Pancakes, especially those containing sugar, dairy, and other additives, can be harmful and difficult for cats to digest. It's best to stick to cat-friendly treats to ensure their health and well-being."
"(B) No.

Nine Inch Nails and Aretha Franklin represent very different musical genres and eras.

"(A) No

To clarify, a 500GB USB device has a significantly larger storage capacity than what is needed for 10 hours of Netflix content. High-quality 1080p streaming content typically requires around 3.6 GB for 10 hours. Given that a 500GB USB drive provides 500,000 MB (or 500 GB) of storage, it far exceeds the 3.6 GB required. Therefore, a 500GB USB device is more than sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
"(A) No

Jon Brower Minnoch, the heaviest person ever recorded, weighed a maximum of 635 kg. The launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 815 kg. Since Minnoch's weight is less than the mass of Voyager 2 at launch, he would not be able to break a chair before the launch of Voyager 2."
"A: Yes

Hedgehogs are cautious creatures that rely on their senses, particularly touch, to navigate and interact with their environment. An animal without a spinal cord would likely be immobile and possibly unresponsive, which could trigger a natural avoidance response in a hedgehog. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a hedgehog would avoid such an animal."
"(A) No

The iPhone, while a groundbreaking technological device, did not initiate a scientific revolution. A scientific revolution typically refers to a period of significant transformation in scientific thought and methodology, which occurred centuries ago. The iPhone, on the other hand, has primarily influenced the fields of consumer electronics and mobile technology."
"(B) No

Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language (ASL). While it can influence which hand is more dominant during signing, it does not dictate the specific signs or the way they are performed. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to whether a person is right-handed or left-handed. Factors that can influence signing include individual style, context, and familiarity with ASL."

The song ""YMCA"" by the Village People has become so well-known that people often sing it when it's mentioned. This is a common cultural phenomenon, especially in fitness and exercise contexts where the song is frequently played."
"(A) Yes

This answer is incorrect. While United Airlines has been involved in several significant aviation incidents, attributing blame in aviation accidents is complex and often involves multiple factors. For instance, the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989 was due to a catastrophic engine failure, not due to any negligence on the part of the airline. However, in other incidents, such as United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977, the airline was found to be at fault due to pilot error. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to claim that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No

A beaver's teeth and a Smilodon's teeth serve distinct purposes. Beavers have strong, continuously growing incisors designed for cutting wood, while Smilodon had long, sharp canine teeth for slicing through the flesh of their prey. The size and structure of these teeth are quite different, so a beaver's teeth would not rival those of a Smilodon."

Rivers provided a reliable water source for irrigation, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and a means of transportation. These factors were crucial for the development and sustainability of early agricultural practices."
"(A) No

While art education is valued and included in many U.S. schools, it is not universally prioritized.

"(A) No

The torso is not inherently protected by the largest or smallest bones in the body. While the ribcage, sternum, and spinal column provide significant protection, a direct and forceful blow can still cause injury to vital organs within the torso. The largest bones, like the femur, and the smallest bones, like those in the ear, do not serve as primary protective structures for the torso. Therefore, the torso remains vulnerable to blows regardless of the size of the bones involved."
"(B) Yes

"(A) No

King Kong, in the films, climbs tall structures like the Empire State Building. The Eiffel Tower, on the other hand, is a well-known landmark in Paris, standing at an elevation of about 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level. Visitors to the Eiffel Tower can reach higher levels, which are naturally at a higher altitude than the ground level. Therefore, King Kong, even when climbing tall buildings, would not be at a higher altitude than visitors to the Eiffel Tower."
"(A) No

Dessert is traditionally consumed after a meal, serving as a sweet conclusion to a meal, not before breakfast."
"(A) No

Disney's second film, ""Pinocchio"" (1940), does not directly rip off a prophet story. While the film includes themes of morality and transformation, these elements are integrated into the story of a wooden puppet coming to life, rather than directly copying a specific prophet narrative."

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union would not support trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is based on the idea that reducing taxes and benefits for the wealthy will lead to economic growth that eventually benefits everyone, including the less fortunate.
