"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4, as there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis
- House 2: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)
- House 3: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must live in House 2 and House 3. Given Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must live in House 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy
- House 3: Percussionist

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover must be in House 3 (as the only remaining house to the right of House 2), the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

Finally, the person who only drinks water must be in House 1, as it is the only remaining house to the left of the root beer lover.

Summarizing the placements:

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the positions.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the tennis player and the person eating kiwis are the same person, so the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."

   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 (from Clue 9) and must be in house 3 or 4, and the grapes person must be to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 and the grapes person in house 4.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Grapes

10. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

    - Since the truck person is in house 1, the convertible person must be in house 2.
    - House 2: SUV (already assigned)
    - Therefore, the loafers person must be in house 1, and the convertible person in house 2.
    - House 1: Root beer lover (already assigned)
    - House 2: SUV (already assigned)
    - Therefore, the loafers person must be in house 1, and the convertible person in house 2.

From the above analysis, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the clues, we can systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so pizza can be in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, which aligns with the first clue.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the dog owner and the person with the bouquet of lilies.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the radio and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (they must be next to each other)

Using Clue 7, the apple is to the left of the cat lover, so the apple must be in House 1.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 12, the orange is to the left of the apple, so the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 13, the banana is to the left of the cat lover, so the banana must be in House 2.

- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the person who drives a convertible must live in house 1, and the history book buff must live in house 2.
- From Clue 2, since the person in house 2 is the history book buff, the person in house 1 cannot be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct house number for each person based on their book preference and sport. Let's summarize the clues and use them step by step:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

We start by placing the golfer in the first house:

1. Golfer - House 1

Next, we use Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible). The only possible positions are:
- House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
- House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Now, we use Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible). The only possible positions are:
- House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
- House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Since the swimmer does not live in the third house (Clue 4), the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Finally, we use Clue 2: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as given directly in Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's use these clues to deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know that the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio. Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio (since the person in house 2 has a fish and likes yellow, as we will deduce).

Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.

16. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
17. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
18. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the person who owns horses must live in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the fish enthusiast, and there is one house between them. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the bird keeper must live in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the second house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house, and the person who had pizza must live in the second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the tea drinker must live in the first house, and the person who likes white must live in the second house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the third house, so the person who had stew must live in the first, second, or fourth house. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house, so the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water must live in the fifth house.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 5**"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the cellist must be in the second and third houses, respectively.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze and apply the given clues to determine the correct arrangement of houses, fruits, lunches, and flowers. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by organizing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, pets, and flowers. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3, and so on.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the first house has a phone, the second house cannot have a phone.
- Since the person wearing boots does not live in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.
- Since the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other, and the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio and horses.

Therefore, the second house has:
- Radio
- Horses

This leaves high heels for the second house. Hence, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Starting with the baseball player in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 1: Basketball player

- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tennis player

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"

"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to find the solution.

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Let's assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, let's consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person living in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - Therefore, House 3 -> Fried Rice.

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - Therefore, House 2 -> Spaghetti.

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 -> Swimmer.

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - Therefore, House 2 -> Cricketer.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and use each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

Given these points, the arrangement of houses and their occupants is as follows:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The only book type left for the third house is science fiction, and the only lunch type left for the first house is fried rice, and the only lunch type left for the second house is pizza.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff, ate fried rice
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast, ate pizza
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic, ate stew

The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the answer.

20. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
21. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
22. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, and House 5 is the stew eater, the remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person in the second house drives a minivan, and the person in the third house is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person in the fourth house is wearing sandals, and the person in the fifth house drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other, so the person in the second house is wearing boots.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3, as the person who owns a sedan is in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3.
   - The basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the person in House 2 would be the soccer player, and the person in House 3 would be the truck driver, which satisfies the condition that the truck driver is to the right of the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

13. **Clue 18**: The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
14. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

Starting with Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house.

Next, using Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know the vase of tulips must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house, but not in the fourth house (since the radio is there). Therefore, the vase of tulips must be in the third or fifth house.

Using Clue 8, the rose bouquet must be in the second house, and the bouquet of daffodils must be in the third house. This means the vase of tulips must be in the fifth house.

Now, using Clue 10, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the third house is taken by the bouquet of daffodils and the fifth house by the vase of tulips, the television must be in the first house.

Using Clue 11, the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is taken by the television, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

Using Clue 12, the bird keeper must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the fourth house is taken by the radio and the fifth house by the vase of tulips, the bird keeper must be in the fifth house.

Using Clue 13, the guitarist must be in the first, second, or third house. Since the first house is taken by the television, the second house by the fish enthusiast, and the third house by the bouquet of daffodils, the guitarist must be in the first house.

Using Clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV must be next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the television and the third house by the bouquet of daffodils, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.

Using Clue 15, the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the third house.

Using Clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house, which is consistent with our previous deductions.

Using Clue 17, the pianist must be in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.

Using Clue 18, the percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover, so the cat lover must be in the third house.

Using Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Television, Bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Bouquet of daffodils, Carnations arrangement
- House 4: Radio
- House 5: Vase of tulips, Bird keeper, Cat lover

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

The answer is \boxed{5}."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."

1. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Tea drinker

3. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. Given that the tea drinker is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - This is consistent with the previous deduction.

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

From the clues and the process of elimination, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, sports, cars, drinks, and flowers. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - This means these two people are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the swimmer and the sedan owner are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the truck driver and the carnations arrangement are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies.

6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tennis player is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - This means the swimmer is in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the minivan is in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
    - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the swimmer is not in house 1, so the swimmer is in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, cars, book preferences, and the fruits they are eating. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1 and see how the other clues fit:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

From the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Radio, Tulips

- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the person who only drinks water. Since they do not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, let's use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The answer is:

"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the possible arrangements based on the clues:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house, so the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).
3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person with a radio must live in House 2, and the person eating apples must live in House 1.
4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

Therefore, the violinist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their sport and lunch choice.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti are (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 2), but House 4 is taken by the golfer. Therefore, the soccer player must be in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4.

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the possible arrangement:
- If the person who likes white lives in house 1, then the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other, so the baseball player must live in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti in house 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

### Combining the Clues:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."

2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

From these clues, we can start filling in the table:

| House | Car       | Lunch     | Fruit    | Book         | Device     |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | ?         | Stew      | Kiwis    | ?            | ?          |
| 2     | Truck     | ?         | ?        | ?            | Gameboy    |

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy, so the truck is in house 2 and the gameboy is in house 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house, so the grilled cheese is in house 4.
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, so the sedan is in house 4 and the oranges are in house 5.
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, so the television is in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio, so the radio is in house 3 and the stew is in house 2.
- The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house, so the kiwis are in house 3.
- The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a convertible does not live in the second house, so the convertible is in house 4.
- The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges, so the gameboy is in house 2 and the oranges are in house 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other, so the phone is in house 4.
- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan, so the minivan is in house 5.

From the table, we can see that the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is (E) 4.
"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader. Since the tennis player does not live in the first house (clue 2), the tennis player must live in the second house. Consequently, the second house must be occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with Clue 4, we know the cellist is in House 1. Let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Using clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white must live in the second and third houses, respectively.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer must live in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

Clue 5 tells us that the soccer player lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must also be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

Clue 2 states that the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

Clue 4 indicates that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

Given the constraints, the only remaining options for House 1 are:
- House 1: Fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

Since the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person who likes green is House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know that the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in the house to the left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the gameboy must be in House 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since House 2 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their pets and cars.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the fish enthusiast and the dog owner based on Clue 4:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

Next, using Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people based on their favorite colors and drinks:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- The person who likes yellow (in the third house) lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must live in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must live in the first house. Therefore, the white person must live in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the second house (Clue 6).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the left of the third house). So, the basketball player must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the cat lover must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the person who likes green cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the person who likes green must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the person who likes blue is in the second house (Clue 6), the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.
- The basketball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1. This means the person who is eating oranges is the basketball player.
- The cat lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 2), so they must be in house 2 or 3.
- The dog owner cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so they must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who likes green cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in house 2 or 3.

From the above deductions, we can place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**

   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Starting with Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. This leaves us with the following possibilities for the other houses:

- House 1: Tennis player, Swimmer, Fantasy book enthusiast, or Romance book lover
- House 2: Kiwis, Cricketer, or White
- House 3: Green, Yellow, or White
- House 4: Oranges, Mangos, or Green
- House 5: Blue

Using Clue 10, we know there are two houses between the romance book lover and the tennis player. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, we know there is one house between the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 13, we know there are two houses between the romance book lover and the mystery book reader. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, or 3.

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with the SUV must be in consecutive houses, with the phone in the left house.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 3, House 4, or House 1 (but House 1 is already taken by the minivan).

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The computer cannot be in House 1.

Let's start placing the information we have:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone must be in House 2 (since the SUV must be in House 4 to be directly right of the phone).

- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

From clue 4, the radio must be in House 4 (since it must be to the right of the gameboy in House 3).

- House 4: SUV and Radio

From clue 5, the convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already taken by the minivan, so the convertible must be in House 2.

- House 2: Phone and Convertible

From clue 6, the computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

- House 3: Gameboy and Computer

Now, we have:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone and Convertible
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer
- House 4: SUV and Radio

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the phone is in the first house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. But the third house is occupied by the vase of tulips, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth or fifth house.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio. Since the radio cannot be in the fourth or fifth house (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), the radio must be in the first, second, or third house. But the first and second houses are occupied by the phone and computer, respectively, so the radio must be in the third house. This means the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fourth or fifth house.
6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the fifth house is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, the rose bouquet must be in the fourth house, and the carnations arrangement must be in the fifth house.

3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer (Clue 1) and Fish enthusiast (Clue 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in House 2.

From Clue 4, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. Therefore, the person eating grapes lives in House 1, and the person with a computer lives in House 2.

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a computer).

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person living in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water, and the person who likes milk cannot be in House 4, we can deduce:
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. Given the remaining options, the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of characteristics in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - Let's denote the house with grapes as G and the house with daffodils as D. G and D are 2 houses apart.

6. **Clue 17**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

7. **Clue 18**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

8. **Clue 14**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - Let's denote the house with carnations as C and the house with the cricketer as Ck. C and Ck are next to each other.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the golfer must have the bouquet of lilies, and the basketball player must have eaten grilled cheese.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the basketball player in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (the soccer player).

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the basketball player in house 2 must have the vase of tulips.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the information.

4. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 4).

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

6. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 6**: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
10. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's start placing the remaining characteristics:
- Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their shoes, lunch, and favorite drinks. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person in house 3 drinks tea.

2. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in a house with a lower number than the root beer lover.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house with a lower number than the person who only drinks water.

5. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Tea drinker in house 3.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **Person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Root beer lover is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1 or 2, and the root beer lover is in house 2, 3, or 4.

   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew is in house 2 or 3.

6. **Person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **Person who ate grilled cheese is not in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Combining Clues:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese).
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

### Arranging the Remaining Information:

- The person who ate stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

### Conclusion:

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Basketball player

3. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Cricketer

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person is a science fiction book fanatic and the other is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we can deduce that the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice must live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot live in house 2, because if they did, the root beer lover would have to live in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can summarize the following:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Not a root beer lover, not a horse owner, not white color lover

Since the person in house 1 likes white, the person in house 2 cannot like white. Also, the person in house 2 cannot own horses (from clue 2) and cannot be a root beer lover (from clue 2).

Given that the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. This means the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover, does not like white

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, their book preferences, lunch choices, and musical instruments. Let's go through the clues step by step.

1. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
2. **The person who had stew lives in the second house.**
3. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
4. **The violinist does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.**
6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils

From clue 5, since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and we know the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From clue 6, since the dog owner lives to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3.

From clue 7, since the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who owns horses is in House 1.

From clue 8, since the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Apple eater
- House 3: Apple eater (but this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Since the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since the coffee drinker is not in house 2 and must be left of the milk drinker).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 2, or the person who likes white lives in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in House 3, and the history book buff must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in House 3, and the person who likes red must live in House 2 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the carnations arrangement in House 1 and the science fiction book fanatic in House 2.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (from Clue 7), and the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3), the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

Now, the person who likes red must be in House 3 (since the person who likes red is next to the person who is wearing loafers, and the only remaining house is House 3).

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Water drinker

2. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
   - Since the water drinker is in House 1, the milk drinker must be in House 3.

   - House 1: Water drinker
   - House 3: Milk drinker

3. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Lilies

4. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since the lilies are in House 2, the tulips must be in House 1.

   - House 1: Tulips
   - House 2: Lilies
   - House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, which must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is:
(B) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the tennis player is in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, since the yellow lover is in the first house, the pizza eater cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the pizza eater must be in either the second or third house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This confirms that the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the second house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be the person who likes green.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the green lover must be in the second house, which aligns with the pizza eater.

To summarize:

- House 2: Green lover (Pizza eater)
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"

5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:

  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).

- Swimmer: House 3
- Violinist: House 2
- Cricketer: House 4
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 6, the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 4, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in Houses 3 and 4, but the swimmer is already in House 3.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 2, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist, so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

9. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

10. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
13. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
14. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
15. **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person who is wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house, which is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.

From Clue 12, the person who has a radio does not live in the second house, so the person who has a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 11, the history book buff lives to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses. The sequence must be: pizza, yellow, tea.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater. The sequence must be: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses based on the provided clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the arrangement of houses, people, and their preferences:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7:
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other (Clue 6), and the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

Using Clue 4:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

Now, using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
- The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

Using Clue 2:
- There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
- The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

Finally, using Clue 1:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their devices, and their shoes. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Television

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the only house left for the person wearing loafers is the first house.

Now, let's assign the drinks based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the person in the first house cannot be the milk drinker. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader does not live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in the first house.

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

   - House 1: Running shoes, House 2: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Running shoes, House 3: Rose bouquet

2. The person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person with pizza. This means:
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

   - If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 3.
   - If the person with sandals is in House 3, the person with carnations is in House 2.
   - If the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with carnations is in House 1.

4. The person with running shoes is directly left of the person with stew. This means:
   - If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
   - If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

5. The person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio. This means:
   - If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
   - If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

6. The person with boots is to the left of the person with pizza. This means:
   - If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
   - If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

7. The person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio. This means:

   - If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
   - If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the left house (House 1), and the person with the lilies lives in the right house (House 2).
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house, so the saxophonist must live in the second house.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

From these deductions, we can conclude:

- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we can place them in the remaining houses.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Using Clue 8, we place the person who only drinks water:

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 5, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.
   - Since the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1 and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:** Carnations arrangement (from Clue 7)
- **House 3:** Yellow (from Clue 4)

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 1:** The vase of tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other. Since House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, House 3 has yellow.
- **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. Since House 3 has yellow, the horses and blue must be in House 2 or House 1.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.
- **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Tulips (since it's next to the bird keeper and not yellow or rose)
- House 3: Yellow

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we can deduce that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist.

From clue 3, since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes red must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, as the only remaining book type is mystery.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer:

1. The golfer lives in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 3).

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. However, the golfer is already in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1, as there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic (who is in house 3).

Thus, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 5, the cat lover is directly left of the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who owns horses must be in House 4:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

From Clue 2, we can deduce that the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff.

Now, using Clue 1:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and owns horses.

This leaves us with the following assignments:
- House 1: Wears sandals, owns horses, ate spaghetti, and is a history book buff.
- House 2: Owns horses, is a history book buff, and ate fried rice.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- **Clue 3:** The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 6:** The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Using **Clue 8**, since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Now, using **Clue 1**, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Using **Clue 4**, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, using **Clue 2**, the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 5**, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Using **Clue 7**, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using **Clue 9**, there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover. The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

- **House 3:** Rose bouquet

From Clue 6, the saxophonist cannot be in House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the saxophonist must be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Saxophonist

From Clue 13, the only drinker left is the tea drinker, who must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Tea drinker

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

The answer is:
**(E) 5**"
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

3. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist are in consecutive houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

   - This means the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue are three houses apart.

10. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
    - This means the person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of House 3.

    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

12. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

13. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct house and food/colored combination for each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red
- The person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who likes yellow lives in House 3, 4, or 5.

Given the clues, we can deduce the following:
- Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and the person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, the only consistent placement for the person who likes green is House 5.
- This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively.
- The person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the house number where the basketball player lives.

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the clues and trying to place the characteristics in the houses.

1. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
9. The cellist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
11. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
13. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
14. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
15. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From Clue 1, the computer must be in house 1 and the root beer lover in house 2.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and they are next to each other).

From Clue 7, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3, so it must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 13, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3).

From Clue 14, the coffee drinker (house 3) and the bouquet of daffodils must be one house apart. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils (house 4) must be to the left of the cellist. So the cellist must be in house 5.

From Clue 6, the percussionist must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the phone and the television. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5 (since the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 8, there is one house between the cellist and the guitarist. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 12, the root beer lover (house 2) lives to the left of the percussionist (house 5).

From Clue 10, the coffee drinker (house 3) lives to the right of the milk drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).

From Clue 11, the guitarist (house 3) lives to the right of the phone (house 1).

From Clue 16, the tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), the tea drinker is in house 1 and the pianist is in house 5.

From Clue 9, the cellist does not live in house 4, so the cellist is in house 5.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the phone and house 2 is the root beer lover, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

- **House 1:** SU, D, C
- **House 2:** CV, FE, RB
- **House 3:** Sx, SF, FB
- **House 4:** P, B
- **House 5:** HB

Thus, the person who drives a minivan (MV) lives in **House 4**.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, devices, cars, flowers, and pets. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
3. **Clue 3:** The dog owner lives in the second house.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
12. **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Hence, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, the people, and their respective musical instruments and fruits. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the solution.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
This means the pianist and the kiwi-eater are in adjacent houses.

#### Clue 2: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

#### Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

#### Clue 4: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, we know the pianist and the kiwi-eater are adjacent, and the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart. This means the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Based on the given clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house (clue 1), they must live in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"The person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we can deduce that the root beer lover must live in the first house since they cannot live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know that the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. This means the pianist must be in the first house and the cellist must be in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, shoes, and flowers. Let's go through the clues step by step:

   - House 4: Boots
   - House 5: Carnations

3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person with carnations.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5.
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips
   - House 5: Loafers

4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - The person with sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since Houses 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person with sandals must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Sandals

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The only remaining positions are Houses 2, 3, and 4.
   - Since House 4 is occupied by the vase of tulips, the person with running shoes must be in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.
   - House 2: Running Shoes
   - House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - The person with the vase of tulips is in House 4, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

   - This is consistent with our arrangement.

8. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is already satisfied since the person with the vase of tulips is in House 4.

From the above steps, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white, and the swimmer is to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who likes white in the middle.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of houses, their occupants, and the flowers in their foyers.

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 5:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1), the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- The coffee drinker must live in the house to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1.
- Therefore, the person in House 2 must be wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

Thus, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we can deduce that the percussionist must live in house 1, as it is to the left of house 2. Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

From clue 3, the only possible positions are:
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.

Since the second house already has the convertible (clue 1), the person who owns a sedan cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who drives a convertible
- House 3: Person who likes white

The only car left for the person in house 1 is the minivan, and the only car left for the person in house 3 is the sedan. Therefore, the person in house 1 likes yellow and drives a minivan, the person in house 2 drives a convertible, and the person in house 3 likes white and drives a sedan.

Thus, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

This leaves the third house for the remaining person. Since the person in the first house ate spaghetti and the person in the second house ate fried rice, the person in the third house must have eaten grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water (as the person in house 2 cannot be drinking water).

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (as the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

The remaining characteristics for each house are:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

Therefore, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels (House 1) must be to the left of the person wearing sandals (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be to the left of the person with a television. Since the person wearing high heels (House 1) is already identified, the tea drinker must be in House 1, and the person with a television must be in House 2.

Thus, we have:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

The only fruit left is kiwis, so the person in House 1 must be eating kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or house 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Let's test the possible placements:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. Therefore, this is not possible.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who only drinks water.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

From Clue 5:
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
- This means the radio must be in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From Clue 1:

- Since House 2 is occupied by the radio, the only possible pair is:
  - House 1: Gameboy
  - House 2: Computer

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 4:
- There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

The remaining devices are the phone and the television. From Clue 2:
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
- The only remaining houses are House 1 and House 2.
- Therefore, House 1 must have the television and House 2 must have the phone.

Thus, the final arrangement is:

- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the percussionist does not live in the second house, they must live in the first house.
- The bird keeper cannot live in the second house, so they must live in the first house as well. However, this would violate Clue 1, which states that the grilled cheese eater lives to the right of the bird keeper. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the second house.
- Consequently, the grilled cheese eater must live in the first house.
- This leaves the pizza eater to live in the second house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A). 

Here’s the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).

8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper (Clue 8).
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9).

From Clue 8, the soccer player must live in the first or second house since the bird keeper is in the third house. From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast must live in the first or second house as well, and they must be to the left of the soccer player.

Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8), so the soccer player must be in the first or second house. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house as well.

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so the baseball player must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan must be in the third or fourth house.

Given these constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house."

8. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
9. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.**
10. **The cat lover lives in the first house.**

Let's start with the cat lover, who lives in the first house.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the information:

- **Clue 10:** The cat lover lives in the first house. So, the cat lover is in House 1.

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Now, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

Finally, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the positions of the people and their corresponding fruits and favorite colors. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

Starting with Clue 6, we know:
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

Using Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can infer that the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

Now, using Clue 1, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

Using Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who is eating a banana must be in house 4. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes red, and house 2 for the person who likes white.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

The person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Thus, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To determine the house number where the person who had stew lives, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, as house 2 is to the right of house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This implies the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given that the person eating oranges is in house 1 (from Clue 1), the only consecutive houses left for the cat lover and the mystery book reader are house 1 and house 2. Since the cat lover is to the right of the mystery book reader (from Clue 2), the cat lover must be in house 2 and the mystery book reader in house 1.

From Clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 1 as well.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.

2. **The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has the water drinker.

3. **The root beer lover lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the root beer drinker.

4. **The person who has a television does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the television is in either the first or third house.

5. **The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips cannot be in the third house, and the television must be in the third house.

From clue 4 and 5, we can deduce:
- The television is in the third house.
- The vase of tulips must be in the first or second house.

Since the root beer drinker is in the first house (clue 3), the vase of tulips cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses. Given that the first house has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Loafers

2. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.
- From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

- The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other (Clue 3), so the golfer must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Baseball player

Next, let's place the flowers:

- The person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player (Clue 5), so the person with carnations must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Horses

3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 is occupied by the person with horses, the person eating mangos must be in either House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by the person eating oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Mangos

4. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Convertible, Horses

5. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person driving a convertible is in House 3, the person driving a truck must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Mangos, Convertible

   - The dog owner cannot be in House 3, so the dog owner must be in House 1.
   - The bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the person with mangos and the person driving a convertible, the bird keeper must be in House 3.
   - House 1: Oranges, Dog Owner
   - House 2: Mangos, Convertible
   - House 3: Horses, Truck, Bird Keeper

From this arrangement, we can see that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in House 3. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

Now, let's use Clue 16 and Clue 15:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

This means:
- House 2: Grapes, Romance book lover.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is grilled cheese, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the answer.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the two people who like root beer and the one who likes guitar must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2:** The dog owner cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the dog owner must live in either house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips must live to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3, as there is no house to the right of house 3. Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** The person with the carnations arrangement must live to the right of the bird keeper. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. The bird keeper must be in either house 2 or house 3.

4. **Combining Clues:**
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, which is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, fruits, and pets in each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangoes

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information and use the clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Mangoes
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3), which means the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first or second house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first or third house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
5. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who is eating mangos cannot live in the first or third house, so they must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, since the person who is eating apples is in the first house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 5, the person who is eating kiwis cannot live in the third house, so they must live in the first house. But the first house is already occupied by the person who is eating apples, so this clue is also consistent.

Therefore, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, which means there is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the clues.

Given clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, which aligns with clue 7. From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, which is already confirmed.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, let's use Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, let's use Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, let's use Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, let's use Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, let's use Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the arrangement of the houses, the people, their musical instruments, shoes, devices, and cars. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:

- From Clue 2, the truck and gameboy must be in adjacent houses, and the minivan must be to the right of the truck.
- From Clue 5, the minivan must be to the right of the truck.

Given these constraints, the only possible arrangement is:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the cellist:
- The minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in house 2.

Now, using Clue 6, we place the flutist:
- The flutist lives directly left of the minivan, so the flutist must be in house 1.

We now have:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the high heels and television:
- The high heels and television are adjacent, so the percussionist must be in house 3 (since the minivan is in house 3).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan (and percussionist)

Finally, we use Clue 7 to place the boots:
- The boots are to the right of the percussionist, so the boots must be in house 3.

We now have:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Minivan (and percussionist, boots)

The remaining shoes, devices, and cars can be assigned as follows:
- The flutist must have a device and a car. Since the minivan is in house 3, the flutist cannot have a minivan. The gameboy is in house 2, so the flutist must have a phone.
- The cellist must have a gameboy or a television. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the cellist must have a television.
- The percussionist must have a gameboy or a phone. Since the gameboy is in house 2 and the flutist has a phone, the percussionist must have a gameboy.
- The high heels and television are adjacent, so the percussionist must have high heels.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 4"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses, the flowers, the drinks, and the types of cars as follows:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

- From Clue 2, the person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).
- From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"
"Let's analyze the given clues step-by-step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given these clues, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly places the bird keeper in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly places the horse owner in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly places the grilled cheese eater in house 1.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

1. **House 1: Running shoes**
2. **House 4: Apples**
3. **House 3: Mystery book reader** (since the person eating apples lives directly left of the mystery book reader)
4. **House 2: Oranges** (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist)
5. **House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast** (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)
6. **House 1: Green** (since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue, and green must be in House 1 or 2, and blue in House 2 or 3)
7. **House 3: Blue** (since green is in House 1 and blue must be in House 3)
8. **House 2: Yellow** (since there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the person who likes yellow lives, and yellow must be in House 2 or 3, and the romance book lover in House 4)
9. **House 4: High heels** (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels)
10. **House 3: Romance book lover** (since the romance book lover lives in House 4 and there are two houses between the romance book lover and the person who likes yellow, who is in House 2)
11. **House 2: Saxophonist** (since the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 5, the saxophonist must be in House 2)
12. **House 5: Percussionist** (since the saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist)
13. **House 1: Violinist** (since the violinist must be in the remaining house)
14. **House 2: Sandals** (since the person who is wearing sandals lives two houses to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 3)
15. **House 3: Pianist** (since the pianist lives two houses to the left of the person who is wearing sandals)
16. **House 4: Cellist** (since the science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the cellist must be in House 4)
17. **House 5: Science fiction book fanatic** (since the science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other)

From the above deductions, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we can directly conclude that the person wearing boots lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the houses, people, their lunch, shoes, sport, and favorite drink. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the basketball player and the violinist both live in the second house, this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to interpret the clues differently. Let's assume the second house is occupied by one of these people, and the other person's characteristic (instrument or sport) is in the first or third house.

- From clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house. This means the basketball player cannot be the violinist and must be in either the first or third house.

- From clue 1, the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, as there is no house to the right of the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must be in the first house.

- If the cricketer is in the first house, the cellist must be in the third house (since the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer).

- This leaves the second house for the violinist and the basketball player. Since the violinist is already in the second house, the basketball player must be in the third house.

- The only sport left for the first house is soccer, as the cricketer is in the first house and the basketball player is in the third house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms that the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.**
2. **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
3. **The flutist lives in the fourth house.**
4. **The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.**

9. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
10. **The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.**
11. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can immediately place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the correct placement is:
- House 1: Milk drinker, Basketball player
- House 2: Violinist, Root beer lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist lives in the second house (house 2), and the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist must be next to each other, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house (house 1).

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the people, fruits, cars, and flowers in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.

- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the root beer lover step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the soccer player must also be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct house number for each person based on their sport, favorite color, and flowers in the foyer. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

From Clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Since the soccer player cannot live in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, so the soccer player must live in House 5, and the cricketer must live in House 1.

- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Soccer, Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the computer must live in house 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To determine the house where the person with a computer lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **House 1: Gameboy, Rose Bouquet**
2. **House 2: Boots**
3. **House 4: Pizza**
4. **House 3: TV**

From clue 14, the carnations arrangement lives left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in one of the first four houses, we can place the carnations arrangement in House 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 13, the loafers live left of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader cannot be in House 1 (Gameboy), and the loafers must be in one of the first four houses, we can place the loafers in House 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 16, the running shoes and computer are next to each other. Since the computer cannot be in House 4 (Pizza), and the running shoes must be in one of the first three houses, we can place the running shoes and computer in Houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

From clue 18, the computer is right of the daffodils. Since the computer and running shoes are next to each other, and the computer cannot be in House 4, the computer must be in House 3, and the running shoes in House 2.

From clue 19, the daffodils are right of the tulips. Since the daffodils are in House 2, the tulips must be in House 1.

From clue 11, the romance book lover is left of the daffodils. Since the daffodils are in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

From clue 8, the rose bouquet is left of the history book. Since the rose bouquet is in House 1, the history book must be in House 2.

From clue 6, the carnations are left of the running shoes. Since the running shoes are in House 2, the carnations must be in House 1.

From clue 14, the carnations are left of the science fiction book. Since the carnations are in House 1, the science fiction book must be in House 2.

From clue 12, the TV is in House 3.

From clue 7, the sandals are right of the high heels. Since the high heels must be in one of the first three houses, and the sandals must be in one of the last two houses, the high heels must be in House 1, and the sandals in House 3.

From clue 15, stew is not in House 2. Since the stew must be in one of the first three houses, and the high heels are in House 1, the stew must be in House 3.

From clue 10, pizza is in House 4.

From clue 9, the science fiction book is not in House 5. Since the science fiction book is in House 2, this is already satisfied.

From clue 5, pizza is in House 4. This is already satisfied.

From clue 1, boots are in House 2. This is already satisfied.

From clue 3, carnations are left of the running shoes. This is already satisfied.

From clue 4, the rose bouquet is in House 1. This is already satisfied.

From clue 17, the phone is not in House 4. Since the phone must be in one of the first three houses, and the high heels are in House 1, the phone must be in House 2.

From clue 18, the computer is right of the daffodils. This is already satisfied.

From clue 19, the daffodils are right of the tulips. This is already satisfied.

From the analysis, the computer is in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a computer lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular, and often jerky movements. These symptoms would make it extremely challenging to perform the precise and controlled movements required in a ballet competition. Therefore, a person with St. Vitus's Dance is unlikely to win a ballet competition."
"(A) No

Pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use human languages, including Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a linguistic game for humans where words are altered by moving the initial consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and adding ""ay."" Since pigs lack the necessary linguistic and cognitive skills to grasp such abstract rules, it is impossible for them to use Pig Latin. However, pigs do have their own sophisticated communication systems, which they use to interact with each other."

Ringo Starr, being a fan of various cuisines, would likely not avoid pot roast at a restaurant unless he had a specific dietary restriction or personal preference against it. Given his known appreciation for food, it’s reasonable to assume he would be open to trying different dishes, including pot roast."

The 1936 Summer Olympics venue, the Olympiastadion Berlin, had a seating capacity of approximately 100,000 spectators. While this capacity is impressive, it is not sufficient to accommodate the modern Super Bowl crowd. The Super Bowl typically attracts a much larger audience, both in terms of stadium attendance and television viewership, which can easily exceed 100,000 people. Therefore, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would not be large enough for a Super Bowl crowd."
"(A) No

Based on my knowledge of marine biology and the specific location of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the eastern Caribbean, brown rock fish are not typically found in the waters surrounding these islands. The marine life in this region is more diverse and includes species adapted to the local environment, which differs from the habitats where brown rock fish are commonly found."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which can involve managing the environment to avoid bee activity. This might include removing male flowers or using protective covers, both of which could be distressing for someone with a fear of insects. Therefore, it might not be the best choice for a gardener with entomophobia."

If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would run out of theses well before half a year. He is known to have written 95 theses in total, which he famously posted on October 31, 1517. At a rate of one thesis per day, he would exhaust his theses after 95 days, which is significantly less than half a year (182.5 days)."

Waltz and slam dance are both forms of dance, but they differ significantly in terms of intensity and potential for injury. Waltz is a more structured and controlled dance, typically performed to slower music, which generally reduces the risk of injury. On the other hand, slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled movements, which can increase the risk of injury. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that waltz is less injurious than slam dance. Both dances can be performed safely with proper training and precautions, but the nature of slam dance generally makes it more prone to injury."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny, also known as the ""War Nickel,"" is not suitable for making silverware. This coin is composed of an alloy containing 56% copper, 35% silver, and 9% manganese. While it does contain silver, the presence of copper and manganese makes it unsuitable for silverware production. Silverware requires materials that are primarily silver to meet quality and hygiene standards. Using coins for such purposes is impractical and could be illegal due to the value of the coins and potential counterfeiting issues."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to the planet's harsh environmental conditions. The surface temperature is approximately 462°C (864°F), which is far too hot for any snowboarding equipment or human to survive. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's, making it challenging to move around. The atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating an inhospitable environment for any form of snowboarding."
"(B) No

Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not involved in the Battle of Tours. The battle, which took place in 732 AD, was led by Charles Martel, Pepin's father. Therefore, Pepin the Short did not play a direct role in the outcome of the Battle of Tours."

Ariana Grande is a public figure who has discussed her mental health struggles, including anxiety and depression. However, there is no public information indicating that she has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or has experienced a traumatic event that would lead to such a diagnosis. Therefore, she would not typically be a relevant topic in a presentation specifically focused on PTSD."

""Rick and Morty"" contains mature themes and content that could be triggering for children of alcoholics or anyone dealing with the effects of alcoholism. The show includes dark humor, complex moral and ethical dilemmas, and sometimes disturbing or violent scenes.

Simon Cowell is not eligible to vote for the next Supreme Court judge. The process for appointing Supreme Court justices involves the President nominating a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. Only U.S. citizens who meet specific eligibility criteria can serve as Supreme Court justices, and Simon Cowell does not meet these requirements. Therefore, he cannot vote for or serve as a Supreme Court judge."
"(A) No

Jack Dempsey, an American boxer active in the early 1900s, lived well before Conor McGregor's time. McGregor's professional fighting career started in 2008, long after Dempsey's last professional fight in 1927. Therefore, Dempsey could not have witnessed any of McGregor's fights."

Euphoria is often associated with drug addiction because many drugs of abuse can induce intense feelings of pleasure and well-being. This rewarding effect plays a significant role in the initial use and continued abuse of these substances, contributing to the development of addiction. However, it's important to understand that addiction involves multiple factors beyond just the experience of euphoria."
"(A) No

Apollo, a figure from Greek mythology, is known for his numerous divine abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and various other supernatural powers. In contrast, D'Artagnan, a character from the novel ""The Three Musketeers,"" is a skilled human swordsman but does not possess any divine or supernatural abilities. While D'Artagnan is highly skilled and brave, the sheer range of abilities that Apollo possesses would likely give him an advantage in a hypothetical confrontation. Therefore, it is unlikely that all of the famous D'Artagnan figures could defeat Apollo, even in a scenario involving multiple D'Artagnan characters."
"The condition that killed Bob Marley was melanoma, a form of skin cancer that developed from a mole on his foot. Sunscreen is effective in protecting the skin from harmful UV radiation, which can contribute to the development of skin cancers.

The French Defense, characterized by the moves 1.e4 e6, does not defend against a four-move checkmate. Fool's Mate, which occurs in a few moves at the beginning of the game, typically involves moves like 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5+. This is a very different sequence from the French Defense, which focuses on controlling the center and developing pieces. Therefore, the French Defense cannot defend against a four-move checkmate."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not necessarily safe to drink. Chlorine is used in water treatment to disinfect and kill harmful microorganisms, but it must be properly managed to ensure it is safe for consumption. After water is treated with chlorine, it needs to be allowed to sit for an adequate amount of time to allow the chlorine to dissipate to safe levels. This process is known as chlorine decay. If the water has not been properly treated or has not been allowed to sit long enough, it may still contain harmful levels of chlorine, which can be toxic and cause health issues. Therefore, it is important to follow local guidelines and water treatment procedures to ensure the water is safe for drinking."
"(B) No

A dichromat, or someone with color vision deficiency, would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color alone. Both gases are colorless, so a dichromat would not have any color-based cues to differentiate between them. The ability to distinguish between these gases would depend on other sensory inputs, such as smell or the physical properties of the gases when they react with their environment."
"(A) Yes

Elizabeth I ruled from 1558 to 1603, and ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" is believed to have been written by Christopher Marlowe and first performed around 1587. Given this timeline, it is entirely plausible that Elizabeth I could have seen the play during her reign. While there is no definitive evidence that she did see it, the timing aligns with the possibility."

While it's possible to take measures to reduce interactions with trolls, it's nearly impossible to completely avoid them on Reddit. Trolls are often drawn to conflict and attention, and they can appear in various threads and forms. However, you can mitigate their impact by setting clear boundaries, avoiding engagement with trolls, reporting abusive content, and using privacy settings to control who can contact you."
"(A) No

Sea turtles in the wild continue to face numerous threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change, which are not alleviated by human quarantine measures. While sea turtles in captivity or protected areas might have better controlled environments, the broader context of their natural habitats remains challenging. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine in the same way humans might."
"The answer is (B) No.

Jesus lived in a first-century context, and the concept of the Easter Bunny, which emerged much later in European folklore, would be unfamiliar to him. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny."
"(A) No

An elephant would not easily defeat a male macaque. Despite the significant size and strength disparity, a macaque would likely use its agility and natural instincts to avoid or minimize direct conflict with an elephant. Elephants are much larger and stronger, but they are not typically aggressive towards smaller primates unless there is a specific threat or provocation. Therefore, a macaque would have a better chance of avoiding or escaping from an elephant rather than being easily defeated."
"(A) No

Augustus was not his real name. He was born Gaius Octavius and adopted the name Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus after being adopted by Julius Caesar. He later took the name Augustus, which became his recognized name."
"(A) No

The Confederate States of America, which existed during the American Civil War (1861-1865), did not speak Old English. Old English, the earliest form of the English language, was spoken from the 5th to the 11th century. By the time of the Civil War, the English language had evolved into Modern English. Therefore, the Confederate States would have spoken a form of Modern English, which includes Early Modern English and Late Modern English, rather than Old English."
"(A) Yes

Robert Wadlow, the tallest person ever recorded, stood at an impressive 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72 meters). In comparison, a German Shepherd typically ranges from 22.5 to 28 inches (57 to 71 cm) in height. Given this significant difference, Robert Wadlow would undoubtedly tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, the primary type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not considered beneficial to health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ethanol was beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate. The cost of a color can vary significantly depending on the specific material, production process, and application. For instance, historically, ultramarine, a pigment derived from lapis lazuli, was extremely expensive due to its rarity and the labor-intensive process of extraction. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in certain applications. Therefore, the cost of a color is context-dependent and can vary widely."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, being a professional shot putter, possesses significant upper body strength. However, throwing a Bengal fox, which typically weighs between 4.4 to 11 pounds, would not be considered within his athletic domain or performed with ease. The act of throwing a small animal raises ethical and safety concerns that go beyond the scope of his training and expertise. Therefore, while he is strong enough to lift and throw objects of similar weight, the specific action of throwing a live animal would not be something he would do with ease."
"(B) Yes

Under Lord Voldemort's rules, students at Hogwarts would not be allowed to have dark marks, which are a symbol of allegiance to him. Therefore, Voldemort himself would have been barred from Hogwarts according to his own regulations."
"(A) No

Both The Jackson 5 and The Isley Brothers were family bands, but The Isley Brothers originally consisted of five members (O'Kelly Isley, Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley, Vernon Isley, and Odessa Isley). While The Jackson 5 had five members as well, the term ""bigger family band"" is subjective and can be interpreted based on the number of family members involved. However, in terms of the number of band members, both bands were equally sized. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that one was definitively bigger than the other."
"(A) Yes

Lactobacillus is not strictly necessary for making pickles, but it can enhance the process. The natural fermentation by lactobacillus produces lactic acid, which not only gives pickles their distinctive flavor but also helps in preserving them. While you can rely on the natural lactobacillus present on the vegetables or in the air, adding a starter culture can ensure a more controlled and consistent fermentation, leading to better-tasting and more safely preserved pickles."
"(A) No

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred in 1929, well before the development of the robotics industry. The first industrial robots were introduced in the 1960s, and the term ""robotics"" as a field gained recognition in the 1970s. Therefore, the crash would not have affected the stocks of robotics companies, as they did not exist at the time."

"(B) Yes

A person with Anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person due to the severe weight loss and nutritional deficiencies associated with the disorder. These factors can lead to weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures."
"(B) No

Sea shanties were typically sung by sailors on ships to coordinate their work. The Oregon Trail was a land route used by settlers in the 19th century, so travelers would have sung songs more relevant to their journey, such as ballads about home or the challenges of the trail, rather than sea shanties."
"(A) Yes

Shooting a bald eagle can result in severe legal penalties, including significant prison time. Bald eagles are protected by federal laws such as the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which carry penalties that can include fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. In contrast, Michael Vick's dogfighting case resulted in a 23-month prison sentence. Therefore, under these laws, shooting a bald eagle could indeed result in more prison time than Michael Vick's sentence."

"(A) No

While it's possible that some YouTube viewers might occasionally receive unsolicited recommendations for audiobooks, it is not a common or frequent occurrence. YouTube's recommendation algorithms are primarily designed to suggest videos based on a viewer's interests and viewing history, rather than promoting specific products like audiobooks. Unsolicited audiobook advice is more likely to come from other sources such as social media, email marketing, or direct recommendations from friends and family."

It's important to seek help if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of a mental health disorder."
"(A) Yes

Paul Bunyan, known for his immense size and strength, would likely be ill-suited for the intricate and detailed task of urban planning. Urban planning requires a nuanced understanding of various factors such as zoning laws, environmental impact, and community needs, which would be challenging for someone with a more straightforward, large-scale approach. His methods, while effective for clearing vast forests, would be too destructive and impractical for the careful development of urban areas."

"(A) No

Alcatraz Island is approximately 220 yards (201 meters) long and 420 yards (384 meters) wide. A standard American football field, including end zones, measures about 360 feet (110 meters) in length and 160 feet (48.8 meters) in width. Given these dimensions, it would not be possible to fit a full-sized football field on Alcatraz Island without overlapping or leaving significant portions of the island unused."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable ingredient for a White Russian. The cocktail is traditionally made with vodka, coffee liqueur (such as Kahlúa), and heavy cream, creating a harmonious blend of flavors. Kaffir lime's unique and strong citrus and floral notes would likely disrupt this balance and not complement the other ingredients effectively."
"(A) Yes

If a Goblin shark hypothetically had limbs, it could potentially ride a bike. While a Goblin shark is adapted for life in the deep sea and lacks the necessary limbs and adaptations for land-based activities, the question assumes a scenario where these limitations are overcome.

The impact of grunge on alternative rock and other genres has been significant, making it clear that the influence of Cobain's music genre persists in various forms of contemporary music."
"(B) No

A spice grinder can still be useful for grinding even the cheapest cinnamon sticks. While the quality and aroma of the cinnamon might be affected by its price, the spice grinder will effectively break down the sticks into smaller pieces, which can enhance the flavor in recipes. The primary factor in grinding effectiveness is the quality and condition of the cinnamon sticks themselves, not their cost."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are devices used for launching projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational principles. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons designed for military use, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, slingshots are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot would be correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."
"(A) No

"(B) No

Dafne Keen is an actress and not a professional singer, so she would not be eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. The contest requires participants to have a strong background in singing and typically involves active musicians or performers."
"(A) Yes

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with some aspects of a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excelled at swift and efficient communication. However, her role in mythology did not involve tasks such as sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. While her divine speed would be an asset, her primary function was more about communication than physical delivery.

Hermes, as the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, had speed and adaptability as key attributes. However, his role in mythology included guiding souls and playing tricks, which might not be the most helpful skills in a UPS job. Additionally, Hermes was often depicted as a trickster, which could lead to complications in a professional setting where reliability and adherence to rules are crucial.

Both deities would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which involves following specific procedures, adhering to schedules, and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job compared to a more fluid and less structured role like a messenger or courier."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, which consists mainly of cookies, is not Paleo-friendly.

Lactic acid is a normal byproduct of the metabolic process that occurs during intense exercise when oxygen supply to the muscles is limited. While it can cause muscle fatigue and the familiar burning sensation, it is not inherently bad for the body. The body naturally clears lactic acid after the exercise. High levels of lactic acid can indicate a medical condition like lactic acidosis, but this is not a normal state and is usually associated with underlying health issues."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to assassinate King James I and the members of the English Parliament by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. This plot was unrelated to Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been executed in 1587. The plot did not target the bloodline of Mary, Queen of Scots, as she was long deceased by the time the plot was conceived. Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot did not eliminate the Mary, Queen of Scots, bloodline."
"(A) Yes

The main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Alice, could potentially join a Masonic Lodge if she were an adult and met the specific requirements of the Lodge. The Masonic Lodge is generally open to men who are of good character and meet the age and other membership criteria set by the particular Lodge or Grand Lodge. Since Alice is a fictional character and the story is set in a fantastical world, if we were to imagine a version of Alice who is an adult and a man, she could indeed join a Masonic Lodge."
"(B) No

While both bull sharks and crocodiles are capable of delivering powerful and painful bites, the force and impact of a crocodile's bite generally exceed that of a bull shark. Crocodiles can exert a tremendous amount of pressure, often over 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), whereas bull sharks typically exert around 1,000 psi. This significant difference in bite force means that a crocodile bite is likely to cause more severe pain and injury."

Rhinoceroses have been poached for their horns, which are believed by some to have medicinal or aphrodisiac properties. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. The horns are made of keratin, the same protein found in human hair and nails, and do not have any sexual enhancement properties. The illegal trade in rhino horns has led to significant threats to rhino populations, contributing to their conservation status as endangered or critically endangered species."
"(A) No

Members of NFL teams do not receive infantry training. NFL players focus on athletic training, sports-specific skills, and physical conditioning to excel in football. Infantry training is specific to military personnel and involves combat and tactical skills, which are not part of an NFL player's preparation for their sport."

"(A) Yes

Without specific details, it's challenging to definitively state their relationship. However, given that both 50 Cent and Jeffrey Atkins (also known as Method Man) are prominent figures in the hip-hop industry, it's reasonable to assume they might have some level of professional and possibly personal acquaintanceship."
"(A) No

In Somalia, the application of Sharia law and local customs can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific circumstances. A celibate cleric would not likely suffer a stoning unless they are accused of a crime that would warrant such a punishment, such as adultery. Additionally, the likelihood of such a punishment being enforced would depend on the local legal and cultural context. Therefore, without specific accusations and in areas where such punishments are not commonly enforced, a celibate cleric is unlikely to face a stoning."
"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden, a country located in Scandinavia. It plays a crucial role in the Swedish political system by representing the people and enacting laws."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should be al dente, meaning it should have a slight firmness to it while still being fully cooked through.

"(A) No

If Christopher Reeve were poor, it is likely that his survival and quality of life would have been significantly impacted. His severe spinal cord injury required extensive medical care, rehabilitation, and support that would have been difficult to access without substantial financial resources. The specialized medical treatments, therapies, and equipment he received were crucial for his survival and management of his condition. Without these resources, his prognosis would have been much worse, and it is reasonable to conclude that his survival might not have been possible."
"The answer is (B) No.

A unanimously elected president's birthday is not typically designated as a break or holiday for mail carriers. Federal holidays are established by the U.S. government and are usually based on historical and cultural significance rather than individual officials' birthdays. Mail carriers generally do not have specific holidays designated for individual officials' birthdays and are expected to work on most days, including weekends."
"(A) No

Dyslexia is not considered the most common intellectual disability in the U.S. Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that affects reading abilities, whereas intellectual disabilities are characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.

"(A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password. A strong password typically requires a combination of different character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can contribute to the complexity of a password when used in combination with other character types. To be considered strong, a password should also be at least 12-16 characters long, random, and not based on easily guessable information."
"(A) No

While enjoying lunch on the beach can be a delightful experience, it is not an effective way to spot a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed when the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point (180 degrees away from the sun) and the sun is at a low enough angle, usually below 42 degrees. This alignment is rare and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach. Additionally, the presence of water can create reflections, but these do not form a full circle."
"(A) Yes

Abdulqawi Yusuf, as the former President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), would typically conduct his work from The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered. Therefore, on a typical work day, he would go to The Hague."
"(A) No

Nancy Drew is a fictional character who solves mysteries as an amateur sleuth, often for personal interest or to help friends and family.

"(A) No

Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford had significantly different political affiliations and ideologies. Gerald Ford was a Republican and served as the 38th President of the United States, while Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and has been a strong advocate for progressive policies. Given their opposing party affiliations and policy stances, it is unlikely that they would have been on the same side on most issues."
"The answer is (B) No.

An explosion at a gunpowder storage facility would not result in a supersonic shock wave. The speed of the shock wave generated by such an explosion depends on the specific conditions and the material involved. While the explosion would generate a strong shock wave, it would typically be subsonic or just slightly supersonic, not supersonic in the sense of exceeding the speed of sound in air, which is approximately 343 meters per second (1,125 feet per second) at sea level and standard temperature. The primary concern would be the potential for a blast wave that could cause significant damage and injury, but this wave would not be supersonic."
"(A) No

There are no known pizza toppings derived from creatures specific to the Black Sea. Pizza toppings generally include common ingredients like vegetables, meats, and cheeses, but not species unique to the Black Sea."

Their skill and endurance are a result of practice and dedication rather than a heightened ability to withstand pain."
"(A) No

Kami Rita, with his extensive experience in high-altitude mountaineering, would find climbing Mount Emei relatively straightforward. Mount Emei, while a significant mountain, does not present the same technical challenges as the peaks he has previously climbed. The ascent primarily involves endurance and acclimatization to altitude, which Kami Rita is well-equipped to handle."
"(B) No

Roman numerals use symbols like I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which correspond to the decimal numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. In a standard Sudoku puzzle, the digits 1 through 9 are used, each appearing exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Since Roman numerals do not include the digits 1 through 9, they cannot be used to fill the normal Sudoku grid."
"(A) No

The question appears to be mixing up the concepts of time zones and daylight hours between two different cities. If it is daytime in Los Angeles, it will be nighttime in Basel, and vice versa, due to the difference in their respective time zones. Therefore, it cannot be true that it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles."
"(A) No

Pancakes are not a suitable snack for cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, and their diet should primarily consist of animal-based proteins. Feeding cats foods like pancakes, which often contain sugars, dairy, and other ingredients that are not part of their natural diet, can lead to digestive issues and other health problems. It's best to provide cats with treats that are specifically formulated for feline consumption."
"The answer is (B) No.

Nine Inch Nails and Aretha Franklin represent distinct musical genres and eras.

You do not need different colored pens for solving a Sudoku puzzle. While using various colors can be helpful for certain solving techniques or to keep track of your progress, it is not necessary for the basic solving process. A single pen or pencil is sufficient to complete a Sudoku grid."
"(B) No

The religions that consider the Himalayas to be sacred, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, have much older origins. Hinduism dates back to the Vedic period, which began around 1500 BCE, and Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE. Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(A) Yes

White rice and sesame seeds can both spoil, but they do so through different mechanisms. Sesame seeds contain fats and oils, which can oxidize and lead to rancidity if exposed to air, light, or heat. In contrast, white rice is primarily composed of carbohydrates and does not contain significant amounts of fats or oils, making it less prone to rancidity. Therefore, white rice is less likely to go rancid compared to sesame seeds."
"(B) No

Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are neurological conditions that affect cognitive processing and do not have a cure. Treatment for learning disabilities typically involves educational strategies, therapies, and support systems, but penicillin is not effective in treating these conditions."

Cancer does not directly cause excess adrenaline production. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is primarily produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. While certain tumors or conditions can affect the adrenal glands and lead to excess adrenaline production (a condition known as pheochromocytoma), this is not a direct result of cancer itself. Cancer can cause various hormonal imbalances and other physiological changes, but excess adrenaline production is not one of them."
"(A) No

Vellore Fort, located in Vellore, India, was built in the 16th century and has a rich history. There is no historical evidence to suggest that grizzly bears, which are native to North America, ever posed a threat to the fort's occupants. Therefore, the occupants of Vellore Fort did not need to defend themselves from grizzly bears."
"(A) No

"A: Yes

A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500,000 MB, which is significantly larger than the approximately 3,600 MB (or 3.6 GB) needed to store 10 hours of Netflix content at high quality. Therefore, a 500GB USB device is more than sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
"(A) No

Jon Brower Minnoch, the heaviest person ever recorded, had a maximum weight of 635 kg (1,400 pounds). In contrast, the launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 815 kg (1,796 pounds). Since Minnoch's maximum weight is less than the launch mass of Voyager 2, he would not be able to break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch."
"A: Yes

Hedgehogs rely on their senses, particularly touch, to navigate their environment. The spinal cord is a critical component of an animal's nervous system, enabling movement and sensory processing. An animal without a spinal cord would likely be immobile and unresponsive, which could be perceived as a threat or a sign of danger by a hedgehog. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a hedgehog would avoid such an animal."
"(A) No

The iPhone, while a groundbreaking technological device, did not initiate a scientific revolution. The term ""scientific revolution"" generally refers to a period of significant transformation in scientific thought and methodology that occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries. This period saw major advancements in fields such as astronomy, physics, and mathematics, fundamentally altering our understanding of the natural world. In contrast, the iPhone primarily revolutionized consumer electronics, mobile computing, and communication technologies."
"(B) No

Handedness does not determine how one uses American Sign Language (ASL). While a person's dominant hand might influence their signing style, it does not dictate the specific signs or the way they are performed. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to whether a person is right-handed or left-handed. Factors such as individual signing style, context, and familiarity with ASL play a more significant role in how ASL is used."
"(A) No

"(A) Yes

The song ""YMCA"" by the Village People has become so widely recognized and memorable that it's common for people to sing along or at least recall the tune when the song is mentioned. This phenomenon is due to the song's catchy melody and its frequent use in exercise routines and popular culture."
"(B) No

The statement ""Was United Airlines blameless in the worst crash in history?"" is not accurate. While United Airlines was not at fault for the mechanical failure that caused the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989, the airline has been found at fault in other accidents. For instance, the crash of United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977 was due to pilot error, and the airline was held responsible. Therefore, it would be incorrect to claim that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No

The Liberty Bell is not in its original location. Originally located in the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, it was moved to a new pavilion on Independence Square in 1976 to better preserve and protect the bell for future generations."
"(A) No

"(A) No

A beaver's teeth and a Smilodon's teeth serve distinct purposes and are not comparable in size or function. Beavers have sharp, continuously growing incisors designed for cutting wood, while Smilodon had long, blade-like canine teeth for slicing through the flesh of their prey. Therefore, a beaver's teeth would not rival those of a Smilodon."
"(B) Yes, the rise of agriculture is often attributed to rivers because many early agricultural societies developed in river valleys. Rivers provided a reliable water source for irrigation, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and a means of transportation. These factors made river valleys ideal locations for the development of agriculture."
"(A) No

While art education is often included in U.S. schools, it is not universally prioritized. The emphasis on core subjects like math, reading, and science for standardized testing and college admissions has sometimes led to reduced funding and support for arts programs. However, many schools still offer art education, recognizing its value for students' holistic development."
"(B) No

Kurt Cobain's death on April 5, 1994, was ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There is no credible evidence linking Daniel LeFever to Cobain's death in any capacity. Therefore, it cannot be said that Daniel LeFever indirectly caused Kurt Cobain's death."
"(A) No

"(A) No

The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was constructed on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, during the 3rd century BC. While the project was influenced by Greek architectural principles and overseen by Greek architects and engineers, it was not solely crafted by Greeks. Local Egyptian labor and materials were also involved in the construction. Therefore, the involvement of Greeks was part of the broader Hellenistic cultural influence in the region, but the lighthouse itself was a collaborative effort."
"(A) No

Keith Richards, the renowned guitarist of The Rolling Stones, has not played a role as a captain of a boat in any movie. While he has appeared in several films, including ""Crossfire Hurricane"" and ""The Lost City of Z,"" and made a cameo in ""The Blues Brothers 2000,"" there is no record of him taking on the role of a boat captain in a movie."
"(B) Yes

Preventive healthcare measures can effectively reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These measures include regular STI testing, consistent use of barrier methods like condoms, vaccination against certain STIs such as HPV and hepatitis B, practicing monogamy with an uninfected partner, and maintaining open communication with sexual partners about STI status. Regular screenings help in early detection and treatment, thereby reducing the risk of transmission to others."
"(B) No

The story of Jesus, as presented in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is not considered to be directly inspired by Egyptian myths. While there are some parallels between certain elements of the Jesus narrative and various mythological or cultural traditions, these parallels are often seen as coincidental or the result of common human experiences and storytelling techniques rather than direct influence. Many scholars argue that the similarities between the stories of Jesus and other figures in various cultures can be attributed to universal themes and motifs found in religious and mythological narratives across different times and places. The development of the Christian narrative about Jesus was influenced by a variety of factors, including Jewish religious traditions, Greek and Roman philosophical ideas, and the cultural context of the early Christian communities."
"The answer is (B) No.

Methuselah, as mentioned in the Bible, is said to have lived for 969 years. In the Common Era, which begins on January 1, 1 CE, no human has reached such an age. The longest confirmed human lifespan on record is 122 years and 164 days, held by Jeanne Calment of France. Therefore, Methuselah would not hold a record in the Common Era."
"(A) Yes

Citizens of Burundi, who primarily speak Kirundi and French, can communicate with citizens of New Brunswick, where both English and French are official languages. Therefore, the ability to communicate exists, especially through French."
"(B) Yes

A pacifist adheres to principles of non-violence and opposes the use of force in any context. Hunting involves the use of force to kill animals, which aligns with violent actions. Therefore, a pacifist would be opposed to hunting."
"(A) No

Voice actors for characters like Goofy and Bugs Bunny are individuals who provide the voices for animated characters, and they do not have physical representations that would include stripes from an American flag. The American flag's stripes represent the original 13 colonies and are a symbol of the United States, not a way to honor or reward voice actors."
"(B) No

SnapCap is not an example of a retail store. SnapCap provides cloud-based inventory management and supply chain solutions for businesses, helping them manage their stock levels and optimize their operations. Retail stores, in contrast, are physical or online locations where goods are sold directly to consumers."

Deaf people can certainly enjoy music through various means. They may experience music through vibrations, visual representations like music videos or sign language interpretations, and tactile sensations from speakers. Many deaf individuals also engage in musical activities, such as playing instruments that do not produce sound or using sign language to express their appreciation and understanding of music."
"(B) No

Human footprints are not absent from Mount Sharp. While there are no actual human footprints on the surface of Mount Sharp on Mars, the marks left by the wheels of the Curiosity rover can be considered a form of human presence. These marks are a result of the rover's traversals across the terrain and serve as evidence of human exploration on the Martian surface."
"(A) No

Lionel Richie was born in 1949, whereas Abraham Lincoln lived from 1809 to 1865. Given the significant time difference, it is impossible for Lionel Richie to have had dinner with Abraham Lincoln."
"(A) Yes

Honey has historical and cultural associations with queens and royalty. In ancient Egypt, honey was highly valued and often used in rituals and the diet of pharaohs, who were considered divine. Similarly, in other cultures, honey has been linked to royal figures due to its luxurious nature and perceived health benefits. These associations reflect the significance of honey as a valuable resource in many societies."
"(A) No

The Eiffel Tower was not used as a symbol of the French Revolution. The tower was constructed between 1887 and 1889 for the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and was named after its designer, Gustave Eiffel. The French Revolution, which occurred from 1789 to 1799, predates the tower by nearly a century. Therefore, the Eiffel Tower did not serve as a symbol during the French Revolution."
"The answer is (A) No.

The safety of the torso from blows depends on various factors, including the force and angle of the impact, as well as the protective structures in place. While the largest bones in the body, such as the femur or pelvis, and the smallest bones, such as those in the ear or the phalanges of the fingers, do not directly protect the torso, the torso itself is protected by the ribcage, sternum, and spinal column. However, even with these protective structures, a direct and forceful blow can still result in injury to the vital organs within the torso."
"(B) Yes

Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu lived in the 14th century during the Ottoman Empire. Given the cultural and culinary context of the time, it is highly probable that he would have eaten börek, a traditional Turkish pastry. As a prominent surgeon and polymath, it is reasonable to assume that he would have been familiar with and possibly enjoyed the local cuisine, including common dishes like börek."
"(A) No

King Kong, in the film, climbs the Empire State Building, which is located in New York City. The Empire State Building stands at an elevation of about 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level. In contrast, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, is also at an elevation of approximately 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level. Therefore, visitors to the Eiffel Tower would be at the same altitude as King Kong when he is climbing the Empire State Building."
"(A) No

Dessert is generally consumed after a meal, serving as a sweet conclusion to a meal rather than being eaten before breakfast."
"(A) No

Disney's second film, ""Pinocchio"" (1940), does not directly rip off a prophet story. While the film includes themes and elements that may resonate with various cultural narratives, it is primarily based on Carlo Collodi's novel ""The Adventures of Pinocchio."" The story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who aspires to become a real boy, is more aligned with themes of morality and self-improvement rather than a specific prophet story."
"(A) No

A chess board and a Shogi board differ in several key aspects. A standard chess board is an 8x8 grid, whereas a Shogi board is a 9x9 grid. Additionally, the rules and pieces used in each game are distinct. Chess has 16 pieces per side, including a king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns, while Shogi has 20 pieces per side, including a king, gold general, silver general, knight, lance, bishop, rook, and nine pawns. These differences make a direct conversion between the two boards impractical and not feasible."
"(B) No

An anxious person would benefit more from evidence-based approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness practices, and gradual exposure to anxiety-provoking situations rather than receiving a magical gift of courage. These methods are grounded in psychological research and have been shown to be effective in managing and reducing anxiety."

"(A) No

A leap year baby born in 1996 would not be 1 year old in the year 2000. They would actually be 4 years old by that time, having celebrated their birthdays in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, and then again in 2000. The year 2000 is not a leap year, so the child would have turned 4 in that year."
"(A) No

Kobe beef is renowned for its high quality and flavor, but it is not used in a BLT, which consists of bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The term ""Kobe"" in the context of a BLT would be a misnomer, as the sandwich does not include any product associated with the Kobe region or its famous beef."
"(B) No

Clark Gable was married three times, while Richard Burton had four marriages. Therefore, Richard Burton had more marriages than Clark Gable."
"(B) Yes

It would be unusual to see frost in September in Texas. Typically, temperatures in September remain above freezing, making frost an uncommon occurrence.

It's important to check the weather forecast and the cruise line's policies regarding cancellations or changes due to storms."
"(A) No

Phileas Fogg's journey around the world, as depicted in Jules Verne's novel, is set in the 1870s. This journey is feasible with the transportation technology available during that time, including steamships and trains. Pope John Paul I's papacy, on the other hand, occurred in 1978, which is more than a century after Fogg's fictional journey. Since there is no overlap between these two time periods, Pope John Paul I's reign would not affect Phileas Fogg's ability to complete his journey."
"(B) No

The Spice Girls are a British pop girl group, while ŽRK Kumanovo is a football club based in Kumanovo, North Macedonia. Since they operate in entirely different domains—music and sports—they cannot compete against each other."
"(B) No. While raw carrots are nutritious and contain beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, cooked carrots are more effective for maximizing vitamin A intake. Cooking breaks down the plant cell walls, making the beta-carotene more readily available for absorption. Therefore, lightly cooking or steaming carrots can enhance the body's ability to utilize the vitamin A they contain."
"(A) No

The requirement for obtaining a driver's license typically does not depend on the grade level a person is in. Instead, it usually depends on meeting specific age and training requirements set by the relevant government agency, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in the United States."

"(B) No

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) would not support trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is based on the idea that reducing taxes and providing benefits to the wealthy will eventually benefit the broader economy and lower-income individuals. This approach aligns more closely with capitalist economic theories. In contrast, the CPSU advocated for a socialist economic system aimed at reducing income disparities and achieving economic equality. The Soviet Union implemented policies such as state ownership of major industries and centralized economic planning to ensure more equitable distribution of resources. These policies were fundamentally at odds with the principles of trickle-down economics."
"(B) Yes

A student in eleventh grade is generally around 16-17 years old, which is below the constitutional requirement of 35 years of age to run for president of the United States. Therefore, a student in eleventh grade would be unable to run for president."
"(A) Yes

The Marvel villain Green Goblin shares his name with a citrus fruit, as ""goblin"" can evoke a green color often associated with citrus fruits like limes or lemons. While the name itself is not a direct reference to a citrus fruit, the green color of the Green Goblin's mask and costume might remind one of citrus colors."
"(A) No

The population of Ashland, Oregon in 2018 was approximately 22,000 people. A military division typically requires between 10,000 to 25,000 personnel. Given that Ashland's population comfortably exceeds the lower end of this range, it would be more than adequate to form a hypothetical military division. Therefore, the population of Ashland in 2018 was sufficient for this purpose."
"(B) Yes

The Walt Disney Company has significant operations in Los Angeles County, including the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank and the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, both of which are located within Los Angeles County."
"(A) Yes

Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy, but he sailed under the Spanish flag.

The reasons for any strained relationship between family members are typically unrelated to their professional lives or career choices."
"(B) Yes

If there were no loggers, it would be difficult to obtain toilet paper because the primary raw material for toilet paper—wood pulp—is derived from trees. Loggers play a crucial role in harvesting these trees, which are then processed into the pulp needed for manufacturing toilet paper. Without loggers, the supply chain for producing toilet paper would be severely disrupted, making it challenging to acquire."
"(B) No

Silverfish are small insects that are not capable of climbing to the top of the Empire State Building.

"(B) No

Largemouth bass are native to specific regions in North America, primarily found in freshwater habitats such as lakes and rivers. The Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean, do not naturally support the presence of largemouth bass. Therefore, someone in the Canary Islands would not be able to fish for largemouth bass in the wild."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

Sloths do not explode if they are not hanging upside down. This is a myth that has no basis in reality. Sloths are well-adapted to their arboreal lifestyle and can move in various positions. They are capable of moving both upside down and right side up, depending on their needs. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that sloths would explode if they were not hanging upside down."
"(B) No

"(A) No

While there have been many Polish poets who have written sonnets on various subjects, including religious themes, I am not aware of a Polish poet who wrote exclusively or primarily about the Islamic religion in sonnet form. The historical and cultural interactions between Poland and Islamic regions have been limited, and there is no widely recognized Polish poet known for this specific genre of work. Therefore, it is unlikely that a Polish poet wrote sonnets specifically about the Islamic religion."
"(B) Yes

Coast to Coast AM, which began in 1993 and is still broadcasting today, has a longer history compared to the Rush Limbaugh show, which started in 1988 and concluded in 2021. Therefore, Coast to Coast AM has more longevity than the Rush Limbaugh show."

"(A) No

Given that Felicity Huffman is known for her involvement in various philanthropic efforts and her support for progressive causes, it is less likely that she would vote for Mike DeWine, who is a Republican governor. Her public stances and advocacy work generally align more with Democratic or progressive values."
"(B) No

Iron Chef is a Japanese television show that began airing in 1993, long after the period of Japanese rule in Korea (1910-1945). During the time of Japanese occupation, television technology was not widely available, and the concept of a cooking competition show like Iron Chef did not exist. Therefore, people in Korea under Japanese rule would not have had the opportunity to watch Iron Chef."
"(A) No

The preference for paying a thousand dollars per episode of ""Days of Our Lives"" over other soap operas would depend on individual preferences and the perceived value of the show.

"(A) No

Black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) are native to North America and are generally not afraid of predators. Their natural predators include coyotes, foxes, and birds of prey, but they have no known interactions with European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), which are native to Europe. Since these species do not coexist in the same geographic region, black-tailed jackrabbits would not fear the European wildcat."
"(A) No

The Forbidden City is open to the public and welcomes visitors. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, it is accessible to anyone interested in its rich history and cultural significance. While there may be security measures and rules to follow, there are no bans on entry."
"(A) Yes

Thanksgiving is often celebrated as a day of gratitude and family gatherings, but it can also be a day of mourning for some. This is particularly true for Native American communities and others who have been impacted by historical and ongoing injustices. For them, Thanksgiving serves as a reminder of the loss of land, culture, and lives. It's important to recognize and respect these perspectives while also celebrating the positive aspects of the holiday."
"(B) No

Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty of Iran, was a secular leader who did not adhere to specific religious beliefs in the same way as religious followers. The concept of Imams is central to Shia Islam, but there is no evidence to suggest that Reza Shah believed in a specific number of Imams.

World of Warcraft is a digital game, and its ""weight"" would refer to the storage space it occupies on a device. A typical installation of World of Warcraft takes up around 15-20 GB of storage. In contrast, a loaf of bread typically weighs between 0.5 to 1.5 pounds (approximately 0.23 to 0.68 kg). Since the weight of a digital file is measured in gigabytes rather than pounds or kilograms, it is clear that 15-20 GB is a negligible amount compared to the weight of a loaf of bread. Therefore, World of Warcraft is not heavier than a loaf of bread."
"(A) No

"(A) No

Paul the Apostle is believed to have died in Rome around 67 AD. The historical records suggest that he died either due to natural causes or by beheading.

The principle of Ahimsa is more concerned with the actions and intentions of the individual during their lifetime rather than the specific circumstances of their death. Therefore, Paul's death, regardless of the method, does not violate the tenets of Ahimsa."

Given that the richest billionaire in 2020, Jeff Bezos, had an estimated net worth of around $160 billion, it would be highly unlikely for Cambodia to be considered too expensive for him to own. The total value of Cambodia's assets and real estate, including land, natural resources, and potential for development, is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. Therefore, the cost would not be prohibitive for someone of Bezos's wealth."
"(B) No

The 40th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, served from 1977 to 1981. The concept of lolcats, which are pictures of cats with humorous captions, emerged much later, around 2006-2007. Therefore, it is not possible for Jimmy Carter to have forwarded lolcats to his friends during his lifetime."
"(A) Yes

Ancient Greece consisted of numerous independent city-states, often numbering around 1,000 at its peak. In contrast, the United States had only 45 states in 1900. Thus, the number of states in Ancient Greece was significantly larger compared to the number of states in the United States in 1900."
"(A) Yes

Douglas fir has indeed been used to support military efforts during wars. During World War II, for example, the wood from Douglas fir was utilized in the construction of ships, aircraft, and other military equipment due to its strength and durability. This made it a crucial resource for the war effort. Additionally, Douglas fir has been used in the construction of military bases and other infrastructure, further highlighting its importance in supporting wartime needs."

Basil is safe from hypervitaminosis D because this condition affects living organisms that can consume excessive amounts of vitamin D, not plants like basil. Basil does not require or process vitamin D in any way, making it immune to this condition."
"(B) No

Christopher Columbus did not explore Antarctica. His voyages in the 15th and early 16th centuries led to the discovery of the Americas, but Antarctica remained undiscovered until the early 19th century."
"(B) No

A sofer, whose primary duties involve writing and preparing Torah scrolls and other religious texts, would not inherently be a bad job for a vegan. The job typically involves using materials like quill pens and parchment, which do not conflict with vegan principles. While some sofers might use leather for binding, a vegan sofer can ensure that all materials used are plant-based and vegan-friendly. Therefore, a vegan could potentially be well-suited for this role."
"(B) No

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who lived from 384 to 322 BCE, well before the establishment of the House of Lords in the British political system. Therefore, he could not have been a member of the House of Lords."
"(A) No

"(B) No

Heath Ledger's death was not caused by his work on The Dark Knight. He passed away on February 22, 2008, due to an accidental overdose of prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines and analgesics. While his role in The Dark Knight was a significant part of his career and earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, it had no direct connection to the circumstances of his death."
"(B) No

Having lip piercings does not inherently lead to more expensive dental bills. While there is a potential risk of dental issues such as chipped teeth or gum problems, these can be mitigated with proper care and regular dental check-ups. Therefore, the cost of dental bills is not necessarily increased by the presence of lip piercings alone."
"(A) Yes

During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising is generally considered inconsiderate due to the increased risk of virus transmission and the potential violation of social distancing guidelines. These activities can be seen as intrusive and may not align with public health recommendations aimed at reducing community spread."

"(A) Yes

An American might confuse a British breakfast for dinner, especially if they are unfamiliar with the traditional full English or full Scottish breakfast. This meal typically includes items such as bacon, sausages, eggs, black pudding, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, baked beans, and toast. Given the substantial nature of these dishes, it is not uncommon for someone unfamiliar with British breakfast customs to mistake it for a dinner."
"(A) Yes

A white cockatoo, such as the Umbrella Cockatoo (Cacatua alba), can have a lifespan of several decades in captivity. Given that the Thirty Years' War lasted from 1618 to 1648, a period of 30 years, it is entirely possible for a white cockatoo to have lived through the entire conflict. In fact, with proper care, some white cockatoos can live up to 60 years or more, making it feasible for one to survive the entire duration of the war."
"(A) Yes

A lifeboat can be used to rescue people in the Hooke Sea if the conditions are suitable. Lifeboats are designed to operate in various marine environments and can be deployed in calm waters or under controlled conditions. However, the success of the rescue would depend on factors such as weather, sea state, and the specific capabilities of the lifeboat and the rescue team."

"(B) No

The Sea of Japan is not landlocked within Japan. It is an arm of the Pacific Ocean, bordered by Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and the Russian Federation."
"(B) No

A birdwatcher would not pursue their hobby at a Philadelphia Eagles game. Birdwatching involves observing and identifying birds in natural settings, such as parks, forests, or wetlands. An indoor stadium where an Eagles game is held does not provide an environment suitable for birdwatching, as it lacks the presence of birds."
"(A) No

Cheb Mami, an Algerian singer and musician, would not typically be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize for Musical Composition, as the prize is generally awarded to American citizens. However, it is not entirely impossible for an international artist to win in other categories or for the Pulitzer committee to make an exception. Therefore, while it is highly unlikely, it is not impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition."
"(A) No

Swallows do not play a role in any famous films about King Arthur. The Arthurian legends typically focus on knights, wizards, and mythical creatures like dragons and griffins, but not birds like swallows. If you have a specific film in mind that you believe might feature swallows, please provide more details, and I can help clarify further."

"(A) Yes

Running for President of India involves substantial financial expenditures, including campaign expenses, travel, and other logistical costs, which can range from several million to tens of millions of Indian Rupees. In contrast, the cost of a new iPhone 11 is significantly lower, typically around 45,000 INR. Therefore, it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11."
"(A) No

A Deacon, being a member of the clergy, is expected to uphold moral and ethical standards and promote positive messages. The podcast ""God Awful Movies,"" which focuses on reviewing and critiquing poorly made films in a humorous and often sarcastic manner, would likely not align with the values and responsibilities of a Deacon. Therefore, it is unlikely that a Deacon would be a fan of this podcast."
"(B) No

Ben & Jerry's was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978. However, both founders are no longer involved in the company's day-to-day operations.

"(A) No

Memory capacity is not inherently diminished in individuals in their 40s, or quadragenarians. Cognitive function can vary widely among people of any age, and factors such as lifestyle, health, and mental activity play significant roles in maintaining or enhancing memory and cognitive abilities."
"(A) No

The Harry Potter series was significantly more successful as a franchise compared to The Matrix for Warner Bros. The Matrix, while commercially successful, had a budget of around $6 million and grossed approximately $217 million worldwide. In contrast, the first Harry Potter film had a budget of about $30 million and grossed over $974 million worldwide. The total box office earnings for the entire Harry Potter series exceeded $7.7 billion. Therefore, the Harry Potter series was a much better investment for Warner Bros."
"(B) No

Professional boxers are at a high risk of dental injuries due to the physical nature of their sport. They frequently experience impacts to the face and mouth, which can result in broken teeth, gum injuries, and other dental issues. This increased risk necessitates regular dental check-ups and treatments, leading to higher dental bills. While protective gear like mouthguards can help reduce the risk, they do not eliminate the need for dental care entirely. Therefore, professional boxers cannot expect to have low dental bills."
"(A) No

Queen Elizabeth I lived from 1533 to 1603, whereas Jean-Paul Sartre was active in the 20th century, from 1905 to 1980. Given the significant time gap between these two historical figures, it is impossible for Queen Elizabeth I to have read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre."
"(A) Yes

The typical duration of open heart surgery ranges from 3 to 6 hours, while the performance of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake usually lasts around 2.5 to 3 hours. Therefore, open heart surgery does finish before the entirety of a Swan Lake performance."
"(B) No

Creating a jet plane requires a vast array of resources, expertise, and infrastructure that are typically provided and supported by a society. Jet planes are the result of complex engineering, materials science, and manufacturing processes that necessitate collaboration among various professionals and industries. Furthermore, the development and production of jet planes rely on advanced facilities, specialized tools, and a wide range of materials, all of which are products of societal advancement. Therefore, a jet plane cannot be made without the support and collaboration of a society."
"(A) No

Astronomers are scientists who study celestial objects and phenomena using scientific methods and observations. They do not write horoscopes, which are based on astrological beliefs rather than scientific evidence. Horoscopes are typically created by astrologers, not astronomers."
"The question of whether Lhamo Thondup, the 14th Dalai Lama, will be considered a saint by the Catholic Church is not applicable. The criteria for sainthood in the Catholic Church are distinct from those in Buddhism. The process for recognizing saints involves a thorough investigation and verification of miracles, which is not relevant to the spiritual leadership role of the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"(B) No

A sesame seed and a wood frog egg are distinctly different in appearance and size. A sesame seed is a small, round seed typically ranging from 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter, while wood frog eggs are laid in long, gelatinous strings that can be several feet long and are usually a pale green color. Given these differences, a sesame seed would not be mistaken for a wood frog egg."

As of the latest information available, there have been no reported or verified allegations of any members of the British royal family in 2020 committing a felony. The British royal family generally maintains a high level of privacy, and any legal issues involving them are typically handled with great discretion. If there were any such allegations, they would likely be subject to significant media and legal scrutiny."
"The correct answer is (B) No.

The NY Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing bell is a local event that occurs in the physical location of the NYSE, which is in New York City. The sound of the closing bell is not transmitted in a way that would allow it to be heard at Universal Music Group's headquarters, located in Los Angeles, California. While there are live streams and recordings available online, the sound itself does not travel over such distances in a meaningful way."
"(A) Yes

While ""The Jungle Book"" by Rudyard Kipling is a beloved classic, it has been subject to criticism for containing racist subtext, particularly in its portrayal of Indian characters. The historical context in which the stories were written—during the height of British colonialism—has led some to argue that the depiction of Indian characters, such as Bagheera and Kaa, reflects the racial biases and stereotypes of the time. These portrayals have been seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes and reinforcing colonial attitudes. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ""The Jungle Book"" does contain racist subtext."
"(A) No

In the 1980s, China implemented the one-child policy, which restricted most urban families to having only one child. While rural families could have two children under certain conditions, the number of children had to be a whole number. Therefore, having Pi (approximately 3.14) children was not an acceptable number."
"(A) No

Bruiser Brody, whose real name was Bruce Healy, did not wrestle on WWE Raw. Brody's career with WWE ended in 1993, while WWE Raw began airing in 1993. Therefore, he could not have appeared on the show."
"(B) No

Sables, being wild animals belonging to the family Mustelidae, are not suitable or ethical for use in weighing down a scale. Standard weighing devices are designed and intended for such purposes, making the use of a live animal both impractical and inhumane."
"(B) No

American Independence Day, celebrated on July 4th, takes place in the summer season, not during autumn."
"(B) No

James Cotton's blues harp, while capable of producing strident sounds, can be adapted to fit within the smooth jazz genre. Skilled players can control their technique to achieve a more mellow and sophisticated sound that complements the overall style of smooth jazz. Therefore, with the right approach, a blues harp can enhance rather than detract from a smooth jazz band's sound."
"(A) Yes

While there isn't a traditional Yeti character in Disney theme parks, there are Yeti-inspired elements and characters. For example, in Disney's Animal Kingdom, there is a Yeti character featured in the ""Muppets From Mars!"" show. Additionally, the Expedition Everest ride includes Yeti-themed attractions."

"(A) No

The Great Recession, which occurred from 2007 to 2009, was a significant economic downturn, but it was not the period of severest unemployment in U.S. history. The Great Depression in the 1930s saw much higher unemployment rates, reaching as high as 25% in 1933. Therefore, the severest period of unemployment in U.S. history was during the Great Depression, not the Great Recession."
"(A) No

The Last Supper, a significant event in Christian tradition, is not celebrated in Islam. While Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet, the specific event of the Last Supper, as described in the New Testament, is not part of Islamic practice or belief. Therefore, no figures from the Last Supper are celebrated in Islamic tradition."
"(A) No

Japanese serfdom, if we consider the historical context of the samurai and peasant classes, generally had a lower status compared to the English feudal system. In Japan, peasants (minshu) were tied to the land but had more rights and mobility compared to European serfs. Serfs in medieval Europe were legally bound to the land and had fewer rights, facing harsher conditions and less freedom. Therefore, the status of serfs in Japan was typically higher than that of serfs in medieval Europe."
"(A) Yes

Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States, while Elagabalus was the 25th Roman Emperor. Since 17 is less than 25, the answer is (B) No. However, the question asks if Andrew Johnson's presidential number exceeds Elagabalus's emperor number, so the correct answer is (A) Yes."
"(A) No

While J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a highly influential and widely read novel, attributing specific criminal actions to it is overly simplistic. Literature can inspire and resonate with readers in various ways, but it is rarely the sole or primary influence on such extreme behaviors. Factors such as personal history, mental health, and social context play much more significant roles. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the book is influential in the context of killers."
"(B) No

Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort. The largest Disney resort is Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, which spans a much larger area compared to Disneyland Paris."
"(A) No

Water skiing requires a substantial amount of liquid water and a suitable environment. Venus's surface conditions are inhospitable for such activities. The surface temperature on Venus averages around 462°C (864°F), which is far too hot for water to exist in a liquid form. Additionally, the surface pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's at sea level, making it impossible for water skiing. Therefore, it is not possible to go water skiing on Venus."
"(A) Yes

People with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) can have varying memory abilities. While some individuals may have excellent memory for certain events, particularly those that are highly emotional or traumatic, others may experience significant memory gaps. Therefore, the answer is not a blanket ""yes"" or ""no,"" but rather depends on the individual and the specific aspects of memory being considered."
"(B) No

The Carnation Revolution, which occurred in Portugal on April 25, 1974, was not the deadliest revolution in Europe. It was relatively peaceful, with a minimal number of casualties, primarily due to its non-violent nature and the subsequent negotiations. Estimates of deaths range from 13 to 20, which is significantly lower than many other European revolutions and uprisings. For comparison, the French Revolution (1789-1799) and the Russian Revolution (1917) resulted in much higher death tolls."
"(B) Yes

Diving to the deepest point of the Red Sea, the Djibouti-Tripoli Trench, would be very difficult for Nuno Gomes due to the extreme pressure and low temperatures at such depths. The high pressure can cause significant physiological challenges, and the cold water and strong currents add to the overall difficulty and risk."
"(B) Yes

"A: No

Dentists specialize in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of conditions related to the teeth, gums, and mouth. Bluetooth issues are not within their scope of practice. For assistance with Bluetooth problems, you should consult a technician or the manufacturer of the device."
"(B) No

An expensive tailor would not use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks. High-quality tailors prefer methods that ensure a clean, durable, and professional finish. Stitching the hem by hand is the preferred technique, as it allows for precise control and a more elegant result. Adhesive might be used in some cases, but it is generally not the preferred method for a professional tailor, especially for high-end garments."
"(B) Yes

Sugar Ray Robinson, or any boxer, could box in Iran if the appropriate boxing organizations and regulations were met. The ability to box in a particular country depends on the boxer's qualifications and the rules of the governing bodies, not on unrelated legal issues such as theft."
"(A) No

A cheetah, despite its impressive speed and strength, lacks the physical capability to topple someone as large and muscular as Big Show. Big Show, a professional wrestler, is significantly larger and stronger than a cheetah, making it impossible for a cheetah to generate enough force to move or topple him."

"(A) No

Ulaanbaatar has a cold climate with severe winters, making it unsuitable for growing citrus plants, which require warmer temperatures to thrive."
"(A) No

Frogs do not feel disgust. This emotion is complex and involves cognitive processes that are not present in frogs or other non-mammalian animals. Frogs may avoid certain stimuli or foods through instinct or simple conditioning, but these behaviors do not constitute the experience of disgust."
"(B) No

Woodrow Wilson, as the 28th President of the United States, would likely not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine in 1896. Wilson's actions and policies during his presidency, such as the segregation of federal agencies, indicate a stance that was not in favor of racial integration. Given this context, it is clear that he would not have supported a decision that reinforced racial segregation."
"(B) Yes

The 1980 Summer Olympics, also known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad, took place in Moscow. ""The Atlantic"" magazine, which began publication in 1857, would have been available during that time. Therefore, it is possible to read ""The Atlantic"" magazine during the 1980 Summer Olympics."
"(B) Yes

Months are based on the solar cycle, as they are designed to approximate the Earth's orbit around the Sun. While the lengths of individual months (30 or 31 days, with February's 28 or 29 days) are not exact, they are adjusted to keep the calendar year synchronized with the solar year, which is approximately 365.25 days."
"(A) No

Martin Luther was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation and is associated with the Lutheran Church, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister who played a significant role in the American civil rights movement."
"(A) No

Pearl Harbor is not the mythical home of a shark goddess. In Polynesian mythology, there is a shark goddess named Hei or Hina, but she is not associated with Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is a significant naval base located in Honolulu, Hawaii, and is historically known for the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, which led to the United States' involvement in World War II."
"(A) No

King Arthur is a legendary figure from medieval British folklore, whereas Anne Boleyn was a historical figure who lived during the Tudor period in the 16th century. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that King Arthur was present at Anne Boleyn's execution in 1536."
"(A) Yes

A paraplegic can certainly conduct an orchestra. The role of a conductor involves musical expertise, leadership, and the ability to communicate with musicians through gestures and expressions, which are not dependent on lower-body mobility. Many accomplished conductors have physical limitations, and paraplegia does not inherently preclude someone from conducting effectively."
"(A) No

Tenzing Norgay was a highly skilled mountaineer, renowned for his contributions to mountaineering, including being part of the first team to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. Given his experience and expertise, climbing Snowdon Mountain would be a relatively straightforward task for him. However, it would not be considered a ""piece of cake"" in the figurative sense, as the term implies something is extremely easy. Snowdon, while a significant peak, is far less challenging than Mount Everest, and Tenzing Norgay would likely find it a manageable but not particularly easy climb."
"(B) No

A Bengal cat, despite its athletic abilities, does not possess the physical attributes necessary to clear a height of 2.45 meters (8 feet 0.25 inches), which is Javier Sotomayor's world record in pole vaulting. The strength, height, and coordination required for such a feat are well beyond the capabilities of any cat. Therefore, a Bengal cat could not hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record."
"(A) Yes

Tony Bennett had three wives during his lifetime and seven children. Therefore, he had more children than he had wives."
"(B) Yes

Fish can indeed develop infections in their throat or mouth areas, which might be analogous to tonsillitis in humans. However, the specific condition would be described differently in veterinary terms due to the unique anatomy of fish. If you suspect your pet fish is ill, it's advisable to consult a veterinarian specializing in aquatic animals."
"(A) No

Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation, died on April 23, 2007. The 2008 Summer Olympics took place in Beijing, China, from August 8 to August 24, 2008. Given these dates, it is clear that Boris Yeltsin could not have watched the 2008 Summer Olympics."
"(A) No

While both Darth Vader and Severus Snape are complex characters in their respective fictional universes, they have distinct differences in their personalities, motivations, and overall character arcs. Darth Vader is a Sith Lord who transitions from a villain to a more sympathetic figure, while Severus Snape starts as a mysterious and often antagonistic character but ultimately becomes a key ally and friend. Their methods, loyalties, and interactions with other characters are quite different, making it inaccurate to say that Darth Vader's character closely resembles Severus Snape's."
"(A) No

In the United States, the legal age to drive varies by state, but it is generally 16 years old. Even if a child is licensed to drive a Mercedes-Benz, they would still need to meet other legal requirements for employment, such as age restrictions and work permits. Therefore, it is not legal for a child to be employed in a position that requires driving, regardless of their driving license status."
"The correct answer is (B) No.

Donald Duck, being a cartoon character, would not be allowed into most grocery stores. Stores have specific security and operational protocols designed for human customers, and they would not accommodate a non-human entity like Donald Duck."

"(A) No

John Gall was born in London, England, and did not originate from the same city as Stanford University, which is located in Stanford, California."
"(B) Yes

Retail jobs can be suitable for a wide range of individuals, regardless of their specific educational background. While some roles may require specialized skills or certifications, many entry-level positions in retail are accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of customer service and a willingness to learn. College-level education can certainly provide valuable skills such as critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving, which are beneficial in retail settings. Additionally, retail environments often offer training programs to help employees develop the necessary skills for their roles. Therefore, retail is a field that can accommodate a diverse group of people."
"(A) No

The modern Brazilian Navy, while highly advanced and capable, would not have been able to turn the tide in the Battle of Actium. The battle took place in 31 BC, long before the development of modern naval technology. The ships and tactics used in the Roman era were fundamentally different from those of today. Additionally, the specific conditions and strategic positioning that favored Octavian's forces in the Battle of Actium would not be replicable with modern naval forces. Therefore, the modern Brazilian Navy would not have the historical context or technological capabilities to influence the outcome of this ancient naval engagement."
"A: No

Injera is a traditional Ethiopian flatbread made from teff flour, and it is not part of the menu offerings at Taco Bell, which focuses on Mexican cuisine."
"(B) No

Lord Voldemort is not associated with any staff member of Durmstrang. While both are significant figures in the Harry Potter series, there is no known connection between Voldemort and the faculty of Durmstrang School of Magic and Witchcraft."
