"Given the clues and the layout of the houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Starting with Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis
- House 2: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)
- House 3: (Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since House 1 is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2 and House 3. Given Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must be in House 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy
- House 3: Percussionist

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover must be in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: High heels

2. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Apples

3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 4.

10. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
    - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

11. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
    - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4.

From the above clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Apples (Clue 9)
- House 2: Pizza (Clue 12, since it must be next to mangos and cannot be in house 1)
- House 3: High heels (Clue 3)
- House 4: Mangos (Clue 12, since it must be next to pizza and cannot be in house 3)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing high heels (House 3) cannot be the root beer lover (Clue 11), so the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is Apples, the root beer lover must be in House 2.

- The person who had pizza (House 2) cannot be the coffee drinker (Clue 10), so the coffee drinker must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 3 is High heels, the coffee drinker must be in House 4.

- The person who is eating grapes (Clue 4) must be in House 4, so the coffee drinker is in House 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5 and 8) must be in House 2, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1.

- The person who drives a truck (Clue 1) must be in House 1, so the person who owns an SUV must be in House 2.

- The person who is wearing loafers (Clue 2) must be in House 1, so the person who drives a convertible must be in House 2.

- The person who is a tea drinker (Clue 7) must be in House 2, since the person who drives a truck (House 1) is to the left of the tea drinker.

Thus, the tea drinker lives in House 2.

The correct answer is: (B) 2."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5.

2. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza can live in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means if the root beer lover lives in house \(x\), the person who had stew lives in house \(x+1\).

4. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.**
   - This is a contradiction with clue 1, but we can assume the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese, which is house 5.

5. **The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means if the coffee drinker lives in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti lives in house \(x+1\).

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

7. **The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live in consecutive houses.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 2 and 4 are left to be filled with pizza, root beer, stew, and milk.

Since the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other, the only logical arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

(B) 3"
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3, and three different devices and colors to assign to the people living in these houses. The clues are:
1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person based on their favorite color, drink, and book preference. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person in house 1 likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a radio.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio. Therefore, the person in house 2 must like green, and the person in house 1 must have a radio.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are two houses apart.
- The person who likes yellow (1st or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are two houses apart.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the cellist must be in the second and third houses, respectively.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by placing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by listing the given information and clues:

- There are 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4.
- Each person has a different pet: horses, cat, dog, and fish.
- Each person has a different flower in their foyer: tulips, lilies, carnations, and daffodils.
- Clue 1: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
- Clue 2: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
- Clue 4: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Clue 5: The cat lover lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the cat lover in house 1 based on Clue 5:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- House 3: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- House 1: Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step:

   - This means the first house has a phone and the second house does not have a phone.

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - Therefore, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

3. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the first house has a phone, the person with the radio must live in the second house (as they are next to each other).

From the above deductions:
- The first house has a phone and boots.
- The second house has horses and a radio.

The only remaining characteristic is high heels, which must belong to the person in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Kiwis

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

From clue 3, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house, the person in house 2 must be driving a truck.

From clue 1, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house, and we already know the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the positions of the characteristics:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
7. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
8. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
9. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 2 and Clue 3:
- The person who drives a truck cannot live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in the third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house.

Using Clue 10:
- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
- The person who likes green must live in the second house.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 5:
- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house, and the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house.

Using Clue 4 and Clue 7:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

The person who owns an SUV cannot live in the first house, so the only remaining option for the first house is the person who is wearing loafers. This leaves the first house as the only option for the person who is wearing loafers.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes yellow must live in the first house.
- The person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fifth house.

Finally, the person who likes red must live in the fifth house, and the person who likes green must live in the second house.

Thus, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

The correct answer is:
\(\boxed{B}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

Given this information, we can fill in the details for each house:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The remaining lunch options are:
- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Stew

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff, ate fried rice
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast, ate pizza
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic, ate stew

The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to find the correct arrangement.

1. **House 1: Soccer player**
2. **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
3. **House 3: Kiwi eater**
4. **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

20. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
21. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
22. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct answer:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in house 4 owns an SUV.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3, as the sedan is in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player cannot be in House 3 (since the cat lover is there), so the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the soccer player would be in House 2, and the truck driver would be in House 3, which satisfies the clue.

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 8**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 11**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
8. **Clue 12**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
9. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
10. **Clue 14**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 15**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
12. **Clue 16**: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 17**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
14. **Clue 18**: The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
15. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

Starting with Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house.

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 7. The vase of tulips must be to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, and the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the vase of tulips would be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips cannot be there. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Using Clue 8, the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house.

Using Clue 9, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the gameboy. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies would be in the first house, and the gameboy would be in the third house.

Using Clue 10, the television does not live in the second house. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the television would be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television would be in the first or third house.

Using Clue 11, the fish enthusiast is to the left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the fish enthusiast would be in the first house.

Using Clue 12, the bird keeper is to the right of the convertible. If the convertible is in the first house, the bird keeper would be in the second house, but the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, so the convertible must be in the third house, and the bird keeper in the fourth house.

Using Clue 13, the guitarist is to the left of the horses. If the horses are in the fifth house, the guitarist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the horses must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the third house.

Using Clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the SUV live next to each other. If the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the SUV would be in the second house.

Using Clue 15, the percussionist is to the left of the carnations. If the carnations are in the fifth house, the percussionist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the carnations must be in the fifth house, and the percussionist in the fourth house.

Using Clue 17, the pianist is to the left of the SUV. If the SUV is in the second house, the pianist would be in the first house.

Using Clue 18, the percussionist is to the left of the cat lover. If the percussionist is in the fourth house, the cat lover would be in the fifth house.

Using Clue 19, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the guitarist. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist would be in the second house, but the fish enthusiast is in the first house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, shoes, musical instruments, and lunch. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Tea drinker

3. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. But house 4 is occupied by the tea drinker, so the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, as the person who had pizza is in house 3 and the saxophonist is in house 2.

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this clue is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

From the clues and the process of elimination, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

2. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Root beer lover

3. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies.

5. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - This means these two people are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, and the lilies are to the right of the basketball player, the lilies must be in house 2 and the daffodils in house 1.

6. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the tennis player in house 3.

7. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 4.

8. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, the banana eater must live in House 4.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
3. **Clue 1:** The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the history book buff must live in House 2.

Next, we use Clue 4:
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the person eating apples must live in either House 1 or House 2. However, House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so the person eating apples must live in House 1.

Using Clue 3:
5. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in House 1, the person wearing running shoes must live in House 2. But House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so this must be re-evaluated. The person wearing running shoes must live in House 1, and the person eating apples must live in House 2.

Now, we use Clue 5:
6. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 1, the person eating mangos must live in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2. But House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so this must be re-evaluated. The person eating mangos must live in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2.

Using Clue 6:
7. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person eating apples is in House 2, the person wearing boots must live in House 4.

Finally, we use Clue 2:
8. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in House 4.

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing sandals, eating mangos
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast

   - Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above deductions:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Using Clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house:
- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, using Clue 8 and Clue 9, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house:
- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**

"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the correct sport and lunch choice for each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 2), which is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the soccer player is in House 5, the grilled cheese must be in House 4, but House 4 is taken by the golfer. Therefore, the soccer player must be in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4.

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

Given Clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the possible arrangement:
- If the person who likes white lives in house 1, then the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.
- The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live next to each other, so the baseball player must live in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti in house 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to determine the house number of the root beer lover.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker must live in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and Clue 2 (revisited):** If the root beer lover lives in the third house, the water drinker must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3, and three different items for lunch: spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. Additionally, each person is wearing one of three types of shoes: loafers, running shoes, or boots.

Given clues:
1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in either the first or the third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried Rice and Loafers

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the given clues, we can systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their preferences. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 6**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
5. **Clue 5**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. **Clue 2**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
7. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.

From Clues 1 and 7, we know:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer (Clue 6), and the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live next to each other (Clue 3), we can place:
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Finally, Clue 2 tells us that the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer, which is already satisfied by the arrangement above. Clue 4 confirms that there is one house between the person with a radio and the person with a computer, which is also satisfied.

Thus, the person who likes red lives in House 1.

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues step by step.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues and the setup of the houses, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in House 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1, as it is to the left of the mystery book reader.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since House 2 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, their occupants, and their pets and cars. Let's break down the clues step by step:

- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Next, using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

Now, using Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Root Beer

3. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Milk

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must be in the fourth house.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house.
   - House 1: Water
   - Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.
   - House 2: White

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the second house (Clue 6).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the left of the third house). So, the basketball player must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1 or 2.
- **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the cat lover must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the person who likes green cannot be in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house). So, the person who likes green must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in the third house (since there is no house to the right of the third house). So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the person who likes blue is in the second house (Clue 6), the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.
- The basketball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1. This means the person who is eating oranges is the basketball player.
- The cat lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 2), so they must be in house 3.
- The dog owner cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who likes green cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in house 3. This means the cat lover likes green.
- The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover (Clue 2), so the baseball player must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 5, and the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.

2. **The person who owns horses lives in the first house.**
   - Horse owner: House 1.

3. **The root beer lover does not live in the first house.**
   - Root beer lover: Houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

5. **There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the pianist are 2 houses apart.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

15. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.**
    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

From clue 16, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who likes milk is in house 3. From clue 8, the guitarist is in house 3, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker is in house 5, and the tennis player is in house 4.

From clue 15, the fish enthusiast is in house 5, and the swimmer is in house 3.

From clue 6, the pianist is in house 3, and the bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 4, the flutist is in house 5, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 7, the guitarist is in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice is in house 3, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 18, the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 3:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
9. **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
10. **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Starting with Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. This gives us:

- House 5: Blue

Next, let's use Clue 10. The romance book lover and the tennis player must be two houses apart. This means the possible pairs are (1, 3), (2, 4), or (3, 5). Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 3: Tennis player

Using Clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. This means the person who is eating kiwis must live in house 2.

- House 2: Kiwis

Now, let's use Clue 12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since house 1 and house 3 are already occupied, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 2, 4, and 5. Given that house 5 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the only possible pair is (2, 4).

- House 2: Kiwis
- House 4: Mangos
- House 5: Blue

Using Clue 13, there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the romance book lover is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- House 4: Mangos
- House 4: Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 11, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in houses 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since house 1, 2, and 4 are already occupied, the person who is eating a banana must live in house 3.

- House 3: Tennis player
- House 3: Banana

Using Clue 3, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the cricketer must live in house 1 or 2. Since house 1 is occupied by the romance book lover, the cricketer must live in house 2.

- House 2: Kiwis
- House 2: Cricketer

Using Clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white must live in house 3.

- House 3: Tennis player
- House 3: White

Using Clue 9, the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 4.

- House 4: Mangos
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast

Using Clue 4, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. This means they must live in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since house 1, 2, 3, and 4 are already occupied, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic must live in houses 1 and 2. Since house 2 is occupied by the cricketer, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic must live in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Finally, using Clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the swimmer must live in house 1 or 2. Since house 1 is occupied by the romance book lover and the golfer, the swimmer must live in house 2.

- House 2: Kiwis
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Swimmer

The only remaining characteristic is the history book buff, which must live in house 3.

- House 3: Tennis player
- House 3: Banana
- House 3: White
- House 3: History book buff

Thus, the number of the house where the history book buff lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.
- From Clue 2, since the dog owner cannot live in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in a grid format. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the person with the phone must be in House 2, and the person with the SUV must be in House 4.

4. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 3, House 4, or House 1 (but House 1 is already taken by the minivan). Therefore, the radio must be in House 4.

5. **The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.**
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.**
   - The computer cannot be in House 1.

Now, let's place the information we have:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone (from clue 3)
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: SUV and Radio (from clues 3 and 4)

Since the convertible cannot be in House 3 and the computer cannot be in House 1, the only remaining options for House 2 and House 3 are:

- House 2: Phone and Convertible
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - Since the phone is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or House 5.
   - House 4 or House 5: Bouquet of lilies

5. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - The radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (since the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), so the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since House 1 is occupied by the phone and House 3 is occupied by the television, the radio must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Radio

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - Therefore, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5.
   - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The only remaining positions for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are House 4 and House 5.
   - Since House 5 is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, the rose bouquet must be in House 4 and the carnations arrangement in House 5.
   - House 4: Rose bouquet
   - House 5: Carnations arrangement

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

4. **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - Let's denote the house with grapes as G and the house with daffodils as D. G and D are 2 houses apart.

6. **Clue 17**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

7. **Clue 18**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

8. **Clue 14**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - Let's denote the house with carnations as C and the house with the cricketer as Ck. C and Ck are next to each other.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1, the person with lilies must be the golfer. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the soccer player in house 3 has daffodils, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the person with tulips must be the basketball player in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- Clue 7: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
- Clue 5: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 7).

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

- Clue 1: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
- Clue 6: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- Clue 10: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in a house with a lower number than the root beer lover.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house with a lower number than the person who only drinks water.

5. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Tea drinker in house 3.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **Person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Root beer lover is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1 or 2, and the root beer lover is in house 2, 3, or 4.

   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1 or 2, and the person who only drinks water is in house 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Person who is wearing running shoes is to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew is in house 2 or 3.

6. **Person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **Person who ate grilled cheese is not in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Combining Clues:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese).
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

### Arranging the Remaining Information:

- The person who ate stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

### Conclusion:

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Basketball player

3. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Cricketer

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Since the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer, and the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person ate something different for lunch: one had pizza and one ate fried rice.
3. Everyone likes a different kind of book: one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we can deduce:
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot live in house 2, because if they did, the root beer lover would have to live in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Not a root beer lover, not a horse owner, not white color lover

Since the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. This means the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in a grid. Let's start by summarizing the given clues and deducing the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
2. **The person who had stew lives in the second house.**
3. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
4. **The violinist does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.**
6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

Let's start by placing the known information:

- From clue 2, the person who had stew lives in the second house.
- From clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

Next, let's use clue 5:
- There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

Next, let's use clue 3:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Let's use clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Let's use clue 1:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From the above deductions, we can place the science fiction book fanatic in house 1 and the percussionist in house 2. This satisfies clue 1 and allows the history book buff to be in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

From the above analysis:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3, and three different fruits and drinks for the three people living in these houses. The clues are as follows:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Apples

From Clue 2, since the mango eater is directly left of the apple eater, and the apple eater is in House 3, the mango eater must be in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 2: Mangoes
- House 3: Apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 2, so the coffee drinker must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mangoes
- House 3: Apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

From Clue 3, the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, or vice versa. Since House 2 already has the science fiction book fanatic, the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

From Clue 7, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes red must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red

From Clue 6, the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Water drinker

2. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
   - Since the water drinker is in House 1, the milk drinker must be in House 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Lilies

4. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since the lilies are in House 2, the tulips must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tulips, Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, and the only drink left is water. Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet must live in House 3.

(B) 3"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the tennis player is in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. But since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This means the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the green lover must be in the first or second house. But the yellow lover is in the first house, so the green lover must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, the devices, the flowers, and the sports. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).
  - Clue 2: The golfer (house 3) is not in the second house.
  - Clue 3: The computer (house 1) and vase of tulips (house 2) are next to each other.
  - Clue 4: The radio (house 3) is to the right of the rose bouquet (house 1).

1. **The swimmer lives in the third house.**
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. **The violinist lives in the second house.**
   - Violinist: House 2

6. **The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. **The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

Let's start placing the known information:

- Swimmer: House 3
- Violinist: House 2
- Cricketer: House 4
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 6, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in consecutive houses. Since the cricketer is in House 4, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in Houses 3 and 4, but the swimmer is already in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."

- **Clue 7 and Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater. So, the sequence is: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover, pizza eater

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is satisfied.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step:

1. **The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Television

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. However, House 4 is already assigned to Television, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the only house left for the person wearing loafers is the first house.

Now, let's assign the drinks based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the person in the first house cannot be the milk drinker. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by organizing the clues and making deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other.
- From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals.
- From Clue 3, the person with running shoes is not in the third house.
- From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person with pizza.
- From Clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the person with sandals.
- From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with stew.
- From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio.
- From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person with pizza.
- From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the saxophonist cannot live in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From the above deductions, we can fill in the details:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 14**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid of five houses, each with a unique characteristic. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 14**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

11. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
12. **Clue 9**: The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Next, we use Clue 4 and Clue 12 to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we need to fit these pairs into the remaining houses.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Using Clue 8, we place the person who only drinks water:

- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 5, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - From clue 1, the person who likes green is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3 (where the fantasy book enthusiast would be to the right), so the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations and House 3 has yellow, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the horses and blue must be in House 1 or House 3. However, House 1 already has carnations, so the horses and blue must be in House 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - The person who owns horses is in House 3, so the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - The percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the percussionist and the truck must be in House 1 and 3.

7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - The sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. Since the bird keeper is in House 2, the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Carnations, Blue, Sedan, Fish Enthusiast
- House 2: Tulips, Bird Keeper
- House 3: Yellow, Horses, Red, Truck, Percussionist

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist.

From clue 3, since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person who likes green must live in house 1, and the person who likes red must live in house 2.

Since the person in house 1 is already identified as a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist, and likes green, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader and likes red.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

14. **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - This means the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer lives in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer lives in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. However, the golfer is in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues step by step.

We have four houses, numbered 1 to 4, and each house has a person with specific characteristics:
- Sport: baseball, golf, soccer, swimming
- Lunch: spaghetti, stew, fried rice, pizza
- Fruit: oranges, apples, banana, grapes
- Pet: fish, cat, horses, bird
- Book: fantasy, science fiction, history, romance

Clues:
1. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house.
5. The cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
7. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player.
8. The bird keeper lives in the third house.
9. The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
11. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 5, we place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 9, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, using Clue 10, we place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Using Clue 2, we place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, using Clue 3, we place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Using Clue 4, we place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Let's analyze the given information and clues step by step to solve the logic grid puzzle.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2, with the following characteristics:
- One person ate fried rice and the other ate spaghetti.
- One person is a cat lover and the other owns horses.
- One person is a history book buff and the other is a romance book lover.
- One person is wearing sandals and the other is wearing running shoes.

Clue 1: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
- This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Person in house 1 ate spaghetti:**
   - The person in house 2 ate fried rice.
   - The person in house 1 is wearing sandals (since the person in house 2 owns horses).
   - The person in house 2 is a history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti).

2. **Person in house 2 ate spaghetti:**
   - The person in house 1 ate fried rice.
   - The person in house 1 owns horses (since the person in house 2 is wearing sandals).
   - The person in house 2 is a history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti).

Given these scenarios, we need to determine the house number where the person who ate fried rice lives.

- In the first scenario, the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, so the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- In the second scenario, the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Since the second scenario fits all the given clues, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Given the characteristics and clues, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the person in house 1 is not the flutist, the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (and the flutist)

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the saxophonist must live in house 1.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid of four houses. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
5. **Clue 7:** The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 2:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
7. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
8. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- **Clue 3:** The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 6:** The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Using **Clue 8**, since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Now, using **Clue 4**, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 2**, the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house and the swimmer is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the tennis player in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 7**, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house, which is correct as the tennis player is in the third house.

Finally, using **Clue 9**, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Carnations

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

15. **Clue 16:** The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
16. **Clue 17:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 5:** Milk drinker

From Clue 15, the television cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Television

From Clue 5, the gameboy lives directly left of the computer. Since the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Gameboy (contradicts the coffee drinker, so re-evaluate)

Re-evaluating, the gameboy must be in House 2 and the computer in House 3.

- **House 2:** Gameboy
- **House 3:** Computer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover cannot be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Root beer lover

From Clue 7, the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in House 2.

- **House 2:** Water drinker (from Clue 16)

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Cricketer
   - House 3: Vase of tulips

6. **Clue 2**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the person who had pizza cannot be in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in the third house.
   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Cricketer
   - House 3: Pizza

7. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Cricketer
   - House 3: Pizza

8. **Clue 6**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the person who owns a sedan cannot be in the first house (golfer), and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the first house (rose bouquet), the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Sedan
   - House 3: Grilled cheese

9. **Clue 9**: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Sedan
   - House 3: Grilled cheese

From the above deductions, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

3. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist are in consecutive houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

4. **Clue 10**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the root beer lover is in a house to the left of the percussionist.

5. **Clue 15**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the cellist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

6. **Clue 3**: The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are in consecutive houses, with the cellist to the left.

7. **Clue 11**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses, with the person who ate spaghetti to the left.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

12. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

13. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct house and food/colored combination for each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in House 4 (from Clue 3 and Clue 2), the person who likes red must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the information:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

We need to place the remaining items and colors. Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the other items, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

Now, we need to place the remaining items and colors in Houses 1, 2, 3, and 4:
- The person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person who likes white must live in a house such that there is one house between them and the person who likes yellow.

Given these constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Grilled Cheese
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Green

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct house number for the basketball player.

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the houses based on the provided clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

   - This means the computer is in house 1 and the root beer lover is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other.
   - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3.

4. **Clue 13:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

5. **Clue 14:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 5.

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
   - If the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 2, 3, or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the cellist must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 6:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - If the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 or 4. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 4, and the percussionist in house 5.

8. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 4 and the percussionist is in house 5, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5.

9. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
    - This is already satisfied as the root beer lover is in house 2 and the percussionist in house 5.

11. **Clue 10:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in House 5.

From Clue 17, there is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

By analyzing the clues and the possible positions, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the truck must be in House 3, and the convertible must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

From Clues 5 and 6, we know:
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 1.

This creates a contradiction because both cannot live in the same house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues. Let's assume the saxophonist and the basketball player are in different houses.

Given Clue 2:
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.

Given Clue 4:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.

Given Clue 5:
- The basketball player lives in house 1.

Given Clue 6:
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's use Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

Finally, let's use Clue 7:
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the characteristics and clues, let's systematically deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - House 1: History book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Wearing high heels.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the first house is wearing loafers, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels.
   - House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The remaining characteristics for the second house are:
- Fish enthusiast
- Wearing high heels

Thus, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person in the first house, who is a history book buff, a cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the correct placements step by step.

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they are in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the pianist and the kiwi-eater must be in adjacent houses, and the violinist and the kiwi-eater must be two houses apart. The only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be to the right of the violinist, so the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, the first house is occupied by the kiwi-eater.
- The fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white, and the swimmer is to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left, the person who likes white in the middle, and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.

Given Clue 5, we know:
- House 2: Rose bouquet

Using Clue 4, since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house. However, Clue 1 tells us that the fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the romance book lover must be to the right of the carnations arrangement (Clue 2), and the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house (fantasy book enthusiast), it must be in the second house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Since the romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips, and the romance book lover must be in the third house, the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house. Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic.

Since the coffee drinker must live to the left of the person wearing sandals, and House 1 is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the coffee drinker must be in House 1. This means the person in House 2 must be wearing sandals.

Now, we can assign the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, science fiction book fanatic.
- House 2: Sandals, romance book lover.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2 has a convertible.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. But house 2 already has the convertible, so this is not possible.
- Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
- Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: White

Now, we need to assign the colors and cars:
- The person in house 1 (yellow) must have a minivan (since the only car left is the minivan).
- The person in house 2 (sedan) has the convertible.
- The person in house 3 (white) must have a sedan (since the only car left is the sedan).

"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

This leaves the third house for the remaining person. The only food left is grilled cheese, and the only book type left is mystery. Therefore, the person in the third house ate grilled cheese and reads mystery books.

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Eating kiwis

2. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - Since House 2 has the person eating kiwis, the person in House 1 must be drinking water (as they are directly left of the person wearing high heels).

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since House 1 has the person drinking water, the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals (as they are directly left of the person who likes yellow).

4. **Remaining Characteristics**:
   - House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
   - House 2: Eating kiwis

5. **Determine Remaining Characteristics**:
   - The person in House 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
   - Therefore, the person in House 1 must be wearing high heels.

Thus, the person in House 1 is wearing high heels.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in the left house (House 1) if the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in the left house (House 1) if the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

Given these deductions:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per Clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (since the only fruit left is kiwis).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3, and three people with different favorite drinks and musical instruments. The clues are as follows:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker

From Clue 4, we know the violinist cannot live in house 3. Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or house 2.

Let's consider the possible positions for the violinist and guitarist based on Clue 2:
- If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (one house between them).
- If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4, so this is not possible.

Thus, the violinist must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 3.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The water drinker must live to the right of the cellist. Since the cellist cannot be in house 3 (as the water drinker would then be in house 4, which is not possible), the cellist must be in house 2, and the water drinker must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - From Clues 1 and 7, we know the third house is occupied by the person who is wearing sandals and likes milk.
   - Therefore, the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

4. **Clue 4**: The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - The fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.
   - The possible positions for the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers are the first and second houses, or the second and third houses, but the third house is already occupied by the person who likes milk and wears sandals.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
   - The fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker and the person who is wearing boots.
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

Thus, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Here are the clues and their implications:

1. The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
3. There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the known facts:

- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
- From Clue 6, the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
- From Clue 8, the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, we can place that:

- House 4: Pizza

Now, let's use Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means:

- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Next, let's use Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. This means:

- House 2: Radio

Now, we have:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 1: The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. This means they must be in either House 1 and House 2, or House 2 and House 3, or House 3 and House 4, or House 4 and House 5. Since House 2 is already occupied by the radio, the only possible pairs are:

- House 1 and House 2 (not possible as House 2 is occupied)
- House 3 and House 4 (not possible as House 4 is occupied by pizza)
- House 4 and House 5 (not possible as House 5 is occupied by spaghetti)

Thus, the only possible pair is:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now, we have:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Finally, we need to place the remaining devices (phone and television) and lunches (stew and fried rice) using the remaining clues:

- Clue 2: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
- Clue 4: There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Since House 1 has the gameboy, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3 (Grilled cheese) or House 5 (Spaghetti). But House 3 is already occupied by grilled cheese, so:

- House 5: Fried rice

This leaves:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

Now, the only remaining device is the phone, and the only remaining lunch is stew. Since the person who has a television must be to the left of the person who has a phone, and the only remaining house is House 1:

- House 1: Television
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball player
- House 5: Percussionist

Next, we use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

7. **Clue 10**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. The stew eater must be in house 1 and the banana eater in house 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater. So, the stew eater must be in house 4 and the banana eater in house 5.

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

From Clue 1 and the fact that the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (as they must be to the right of the bird keeper).

This leaves the pizza eater to live in house 2.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).

Here’s the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house (Clue 2).
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house (Clue 5).
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house (Clue 6).
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7).
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper (Clue 8).
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9).

From Clue 8, the soccer player must live in the first or second house since the bird keeper is in the third house. From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast must live in the first or second house as well, and they must be to the left of the soccer player.

Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8), so the soccer player must be in the first or second house. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house as well.

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so the baseball player must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan must be in the third or fourth house.

Given the constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's start by organizing the information and applying the clues step by step.

1. **House 1: Cat lover**
2. **Clue 10:** The cat lover lives in the first house. So, the cat lover is in House 1.

Using the other clues, we can deduce the following:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).
- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).
- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).
- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the given clues to deduce the correct positions.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Grapes

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

Using Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can deduce the positions of the people who like green and red:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. Since House 2 is occupied by grapes, they must be in houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green must be to the left of the person who likes yellow:
- If the person who likes green is in House 1, the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.

From Clue 1, the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who is eating kiwis:
- If the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 1.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives:
- If the person who is eating kiwis is in House 1, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 4, and the person who likes white must be in House 3.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red, White
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Thus, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given Clue 1, we know:
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

Given Clue 2, we know:
- The cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in house 1 and the cat lover in house 2.

Given Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3, and three different characteristics for each person living in these houses:
- Flowers in the foyer: rose bouquet, daffodils, tulips
- Favorite drink: water, milk, root beer
- Device: computer, television, phone

Given clues:
1. The person with daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone.
2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The person with a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person with a television lives to the right of the person with tulips.

From clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Root beer drinker

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Water drinker

From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in either the first or third house. However, clue 5 tells us that the television is to the right of the tulips. Since the root beer drinker is in the first house, the tulips cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the tulips must be in the second house, and the television must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the tulips are in the second house, the daffodils must be in the first house, and the phone must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From the arrangement, we can see that the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Loafers

2. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.
- From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, sports, flowers, and pets. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the sports:

- From Clue 1, the golfer cannot be in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the cricketer cannot be in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the golfer and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses.
- From Clue 4, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be in adjacent houses.
- From Clue 5, the person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player.
- From Clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet must be to the left of the person with daffodils.

Given these constraints, let's start by placing the sports:

- Since the golfer cannot be in house 3 and the cricketer cannot be in house 3, the baseball player must be in house 3.
- The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other (Clue 3), so the golfer must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Baseball player

Next, let's place the flowers:

- The person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player (Clue 5), so the person with carnations must be in house 1.
- The person with carnations and the person with horses are next to each other (Clue 4), so the person with horses must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player

Finally, let's place the pets:

- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the person with horses (Clue 2), so the fish enthusiast must be in house 1.
- The person with horses and the baseball player are next to each other, and the person with a rose bouquet must be to the left of the person with daffodils (Clue 6).

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person with horses is in house 2, the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1, and the person with daffodils must be in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast, Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player, Daffodils

Thus, the person who owns horses lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Horses

3. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in consecutive houses.

5. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 2: Mangos

From Clue 6, since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.

- House 3: Convertible, Horses

From Clue 2, the person who drives a truck must be in House 2.

- House 2: Mangos, Convertible

From Clue 3, the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper must be in House 3 or House 2. Since House 2 is occupied by the convertible and mangos, the bird keeper must be in House 3.

- House 3: Convertible, Horses, Bird Keeper

This leaves House 1 for the dog owner.

- House 1: Oranges, Dog Owner

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

- From Clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Mystery book reader in house 1, Romance book lover in house 3, History book buff in house 4.

Next, we place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house.
- From Clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.
- From Clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house.
- Given the above, the only possible arrangement for the percussionist and the guitarist is:
  - Guitarrist in house 2, Percussionist in house 3, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Now, we place the remaining people and their preferences:
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. The only remaining houses are 4 and 5. Since the person who had stew is in house 4, the saxophonist must be in house 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Flutist
4. Stew
5. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 10**: The romance book lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.

- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in House 3. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

Now, let's use Clue 16 and Clue 15:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.

This means:
- House 2: Grapes, Romance book lover.
- House 3: Romance book lover.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Green.

From Clue 11, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the mystery book reader must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. The SUV owner must be in House 1 (since the sedan is in House 1 and the SUV cannot be in House 2 or 3).

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is the sedan, so the person who likes white must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the history book buff does not live in the fifth house. Since the mystery book reader is in House 5, the history book buff must be in House 1, 2, or 4. But House 1 is the sedan and House 2 is grapes, so the history book buff must be in House 4.

From Clue 17, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is grilled cheese, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2:** The dog owner cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the dog owner must live in either house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3:** The person with the vase of tulips must live to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3 (since there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** The person with the carnations arrangement must live to the right of the bird keeper. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. The bird keeper must be in either house 2 or house 3.

4. **Combining Clues:**
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, which is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in a grid format. Let's start by listing the given clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangoes

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Mangoes
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3), so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first or second house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can systematically deduce the correct arrangement:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first or third house, so they must be in either the second or fourth house. Since the second house is occupied by the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with our current arrangement.
5. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house, so they must be in either the first or fourth house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating apples and the fourth house is occupied by the person eating mangos, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house. But the second house is occupied by the coffee drinker, so this clue is also consistent.

From the above deductions, we can confirm the arrangement:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. Mangos

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, we can systematically deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, people, their favorite colors, sports, and fruits. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The soccer player lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who likes white lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.
4. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with Clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 11**: The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the fifth house.
8. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red must live in the third house (as the soccer player lives there), the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living there. Therefore, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{D}\)."

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:

- If the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2, and the minivan must be in house 3 (since the minivan is to the right of the truck).
- If the truck is in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 3, and the minivan must be in house 3 (but this would violate Clue 6, as the flutist cannot be in house 0).

So, the truck must be in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the minivan in house 3.

Now, the minivan and cellist are adjacent (Clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 2.

The flutist is directly left of the minivan (Clue 6), so the flutist must be in house 1.

The high heels and television are adjacent (Clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (Clue 7). Since the flutist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 3 (the only remaining house).

Now, we need to assign the shoes, devices, and cars:

- The flutist (house 1) must have a device and a car. Since the minivan is in house 3, the flutist cannot have a minivan. The gameboy is in house 2, so the flutist must have a phone or a television. The television is adjacent to high heels, so the flutist must have a phone.
- The cellist (house 2) must have a gameboy or a television. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the cellist must have a television.
- The percussionist (house 3) must have a gameboy or a phone. Since the gameboy is in house 2 and the flutist has a phone, the percussionist must have a gameboy.
- The high heels and television are adjacent, so the percussionist must have high heels.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television.
6. The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
8. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
9. The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
10. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
11. The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
12. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
13. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clues 1 and 5, we know:
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Television

From clues 2 and 8, we know:
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Pianist

From clues 9, 10, and 12, we know:
- House 3: Lilies
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Oranges
- House 6: Saxophonist

From clues 3, 4, and 7, we know:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Guitars
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Radio

From clue 6, we know:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Guitars

From clue 13, we know:
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Television

Now, we can place the fruits:
- House 1: Apples
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Oranges

Thus, the person eating apples lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(A) 4"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, the flowers, the drinks, and the types of cars. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Now, we know:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

Let's start by organizing the clues and making deductions:

- From Clue 4, the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1, and the person who had stew lives in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.
- From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).
- From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

"Let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses, each with a person who has different characteristics:
1. Shoes: Boots, Running Shoes, Sandals
2. Device: Gameboy, Phone, Television
3. Favorite Color: Blue, Red, White
4. Fruit: Mangoes, Grapes, Apples

Given clues:
1. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
2. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
4. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
5. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
6. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5:
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 2: Red

From Clue 6:
- The person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2, but since House 2 is Red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

From Clue 1:
- The person who is eating grapes must be in House 3 (right of the person who likes red, which is in House 2).

From Clue 3:
- The person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart. Since House 3 is grapes, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Apples, Sandals
  - House 2: Red, Sandals (but this is a contradiction since House 2 is Red, so it must be:
  - House 1: Apples, Sandals
  - House 2: Red, Running Shoes (since the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes)

From Clue 2:
- The person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with running shoes must be in House 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Running Shoes
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

The person who has a phone lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This means the bird keeper is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This means the horse owner is in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This means the grilled cheese eater is in house 1.

Given these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **House 1: Running shoes**
2. **House 4: Apples**
3. **House 3: Mystery book reader** (since the person eating apples is directly left of the mystery book reader)
4. **House 2: Oranges** (since the person eating oranges is directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)
5. **House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast** (since the person eating oranges is directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
  - Since green must be to the left of blue, and considering the other clues, green must be in House 1 and blue in House 2.

- **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
  - This is already satisfied with oranges in House 2 and green in House 1.

- **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 4), (2, 5)
  - Since green is in House 1 and blue in House 2, yellow must be in House 2 and the romance book lover in House 4.

- **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
  - Fantasy book enthusiast in House 5, so saxophonist must be in House 3.

- **Clue 8**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)
  - Since green is in House 1 and blue in House 2, white must be in House 1 and banana in House 2.

- **Clue 9**: The person who is eating oranges and the person who is wearing loafers live directly next to each other.
  - Oranges in House 2, so loafers must be in House 3.

- **Clue 10**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
  - Grapes must be in House 3 and history book buff in House 5.

- **Clue 11**: The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - Yellow in House 2, so high heels must be in House 3.

- **Clue 12**: The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.
  - Apples in House 4.

- **Clue 13**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
  - Oranges in House 2, fantasy book enthusiast in House 5.

- **Clue 14**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
  - Saxophonist in House 3, percussionist in House 4.

- **Clue 15**: The science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other.
  - Science fiction book fanatic and cellist must be in (2, 3) or (3, 4).
  - Since saxophonist is in House 3 and percussionist in House 4, science fiction book fanatic and cellist must be in (2, 3).

From the above analysis, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement of the people in the houses.

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the second house cannot be occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist simultaneously. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the clues are referring to different people.

Given the first clue, the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, as there is no house to the right of the third house. Thus, the cricketer must be in the first house.

If the cricketer is in the first house, the cellist must be in the third house (since the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer).

This leaves the second house to be occupied by the violinist, as per clue 3.

Now, the basketball player must be in the third house, as the second house is occupied by the violinist and the first house is occupied by the cricketer.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of the people in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.**
2. **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
3. **The flutist lives in the fourth house.**
4. **The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **The guitarist does not live in the third house.**
6. **The violinist does not live in the third house.**
7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.**
8. **The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.**
9. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
10. **The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.**
11. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the pianist lives in the second house (clue 2), the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house (clue 1).

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the information in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct answer:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the soccer player must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic (sport, favorite color, and flowers) in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

From Clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Since the soccer player cannot live in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, so the soccer player must live in House 5, and the cricketer must live in House 1.

- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Soccer, Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the violinist lives in the first house (House 1), the person in House 2 must be the bird keeper.
- The person with the computer lives in House 1 (to the left of the bird keeper, who is in House 2).

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Let's solve this logic grid puzzle step by step.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3, and we need to determine the person living in each house based on the given clues.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4, since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3, since the person in House 3 owns a sedan, we can place the sedan in House 3.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, we need to determine who is wearing running shoes. Since the cat lover is in House 1, the fish enthusiast must be in House 2 (wearing high heels), and the dog owner is in House 3, the only person left is the one in House 3, who is wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1:
- The history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4:
- The mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3:
- The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1, but we already placed the phone there. Therefore, the only remaining device for house 1 is the phone, and the only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to consider the total number of theses he wrote and the number of days in half a year.

Martin Luther is known to have written 95 theses. Half a year is approximately 182.5 days. If he wrote one thesis per day, he would run out of theses after 95 days.

Since 95 days is less than 182.5 days, he would indeed run out of theses before half a year is over.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"

Waltz and slam dance have different characteristics and levels of intensity. While waltz is a more structured and controlled dance, slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled movements. Both dances can be performed safely with proper precautions, but slam dance may have a higher risk of injury due to its more intense nature. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively stated that waltz is less injurious than slam dance."

To analyze this logically, we need to consider the attributes and abilities of Apollo and D'Artagnan. Apollo, being a god in Greek mythology, possesses a wide array of supernatural abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to manipulate natural elements. These attributes would give him a significant advantage in a physical confrontation.

D'Artagnan, on the other hand, is a human character from ""The Three Musketeers,"" known for his exceptional swordsmanship and bravery. While he is a skilled swordsman, his abilities are limited to human capabilities and do not include any supernatural elements.

Given these differences, a single Apollo would likely have an advantage over a single D'Artagnan due to his divine powers. However, if we consider multiple D'Artagnan figures, the situation becomes more complex. The number of D'Artagnan figures would need to be significant to potentially outweigh Apollo's divine abilities. Without a specific number, it's challenging to definitively state that all D'Artagnan figures could defeat Apollo.

Therefore, the most straightforward and logical answer, considering the typical scenario of a single D'Artagnan, is (A) No."

For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is clear that ethanol was not beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The claim that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate. The cost of a color can vary significantly depending on the specific application and the materials used. For instance, certain pigments like lapis lazuli, historically used to create ultramarine, have been very expensive. However, this does not make blue universally the most expensive color. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in specific contexts. Therefore, the statement is not correct."
"(B) No

Given Ryan Crouser's exceptional strength as a professional shot putter, he could likely throw a small animal like a Bengal fox. However, the term ""with ease"" implies a level of comfort and control that goes beyond the physical capability. Throwing a small animal is not a typical or safe action, even for someone with his strength. Therefore, while he could potentially throw a Bengal fox, he would not do so with ease."

"To determine if a hamster could experience two leap years, we need to consider the hamster's typical lifespan and the frequency of leap years.

A hamster generally lives for about 2 to 3 years. Leap years occur every 4 years, with some exceptions (years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not leap years).

Given a 2-year lifespan, a hamster would experience at most one leap year. Similarly, in a 3-year lifespan, a hamster would also experience at most one leap year.

Therefore, within the typical lifespan of a hamster, it is not possible for a hamster to experience two leap years.

The correct answer is (A) No."

"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are devices used for launching projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational mechanics. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons designed for military use, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, slingshots are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with some aspects of a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excels at swift and efficient communication but her role doesn't involve tasks like sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. Hermes, as the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, has speed and adaptability but his mythological duties include guiding souls and playing tricks, which might not be ideal for a professional setting. Both would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which requires adherence to procedures and schedules. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet primarily consists of cookies, which are processed foods containing grains and sugars.

"To determine whether it would be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei, we need to consider his climbing experience and the relative difficulty of Mount Emei.

Kami Rita is a highly experienced mountaineer with a track record of climbing some of the world's most challenging peaks, including Mount Everest. His skills and experience would make him well-prepared for the challenges of Mount Emei.

Mount Emei, while a significant mountain, is not as technically demanding as the peaks Kami Rita has climbed. The highest peak, the Golden Summit, requires more endurance and acclimatization to altitude rather than advanced technical skills. Given Kami Rita's experience, he would likely find the climb manageable.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"

Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(A) Yes

White rice and sesame seeds can both spoil, but they do so through different mechanisms. Sesame seeds contain fats and oils that can oxidize and lead to rancidity, especially if exposed to air, light, or heat. In contrast, white rice is primarily composed of carbohydrates and does not contain significant amounts of fats or oils, making it less prone to rancidity. Therefore, white rice is less likely to go rancid compared to sesame seeds."
"(B) No

Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not learning disabilities. Therefore, it does not cure learning disabilities."

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to calculate the storage requirements for 10 hours of streaming content.

Assuming high-quality streaming (1080p), the average bitrate is around 6 Mbps. For 1 hour of content, this translates to approximately 360 MB (6 Mbps * 60 minutes).

For 10 hours, the storage requirement would be:
\[ 360 \text{ MB/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ MB} \]
Converting MB to GB:
\[ 3600 \text{ MB} = 3.6 \text{ GB} \]

"To determine whether Jon Brower Minnoch would break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch, we need to compare his maximum recorded weight to the mass of Voyager 2 at launch.

Jon Brower Minnoch's maximum recorded weight was 635 kg (1,400 pounds).

Voyager 2's launch mass was approximately 815 kg (1,796 pounds).

Since 635 kg is less than 815 kg, Jon Brower Minnoch's weight would not be sufficient to break a chair that could support the mass of Voyager 2.

Factors such as individual style, context, and familiarity with ASL play a more significant role in how ASL is used."

To determine if you could watch all of ""JAG"" in six months, let's break it down logically:

1. **Total Episodes**: ""JAG"" has 221 episodes.
2. **Episode Length**: Each episode is approximately 45 minutes long.
3. **Total Viewing Time**: 
   \[
   221 \text{ episodes} \times 45 \text{ minutes/episode} = 9945 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. **Convert to Hours**:
   \[
   9945 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 165.75 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Number of Days in Six Months**: Assuming 180 days (6 months * 30 days/month).
6. **Daily Viewing Time**:
   \[
   165.75 \text{ hours} \div 180 \text{ days} \approx 0.92 \text{ hours/day}

"(B) Yes

The Jungle Book, both in its original form and various adaptations, has been subject to critical analysis regarding potential racist subtext.

This Supreme Court case, decided in 1896, upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, which Wilson likely would have viewed as reinforcing racial segregation. Given his actions during his presidency, including the segregation of federal agencies, it is clear that Wilson's views and policies did not align with the principles established by Plessy v. Ferguson."

Tenzing Norgay was a highly skilled mountaineer, renowned for his achievements in climbing some of the world's most challenging peaks. Snowdon Mountain, while a significant climb, is far less daunting compared to Mount Everest. Given Tenzing Norgay's experience and expertise, it would not be considered a ""piece of cake"" for him.
