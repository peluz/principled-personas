"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips is in House 1 (directly left of House 2, where the flutist lives).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies is in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist is in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The only instrument left is percussion, which must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
7. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
8. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From Clue 5 and Clue 8, we know:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in the second and third houses. Since the percussionist does not live in the second house (Clue 7), the percussionist must live in the third house. Therefore:
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the second house:
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the gameboy is in the second house, the cellist must be in the first house:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the cellist lives in House 3.

The correct answer is:
\(\boxed{C}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing some characteristics:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."

   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in house 1.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

- House 3: High heels (Clue 3)
- House 4: Mangos (Clue 12, since the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2)
- The person who drives a convertible must be in house 2 (Clue 2)
- The person who drives a truck must be in house 1 (Clue 1)
- The person who owns an SUV must be in house 2 (Clue 1)
- The person who ate fried rice must be in house 3 (Clue 6, since the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice)
- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3 (Clue 5, since the person who ate spaghetti lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes)
- The person who is eating grapes must be in house 4 (Clue 4, since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes)
- The person who is a tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the only remaining house is house 2, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who drives a convertible are already placed)

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is: (B) 1."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

From clue 1 and 4, we know:
- House 5: Grilled cheese and water.

From clue 6, we know:
- House 3: Spaghetti.

From clue 5, we know:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who had stew is in house 3. But since house 3 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the root beer lover must be in house 1, and the person who had stew is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who had pizza cannot be in house 1, so they must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5. But house 2 and 3 are already occupied, so the person who had pizza must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Grilled cheese and water

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

6. **Assigning Sports and Fruits**:
   - House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
   - House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
   - House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, and the history book buff lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: The person who is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader (since the history book buff is in house 2).

"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

First, we know the golfer lives in the first house:
1. Golfer

Next, let's use Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the mystery book reader cannot be in the fourth house. So, the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
- House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Now, let's use Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in the first house, and the swimmer cannot be in the fourth house. So, the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
- House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Since the swimmer cannot be in the third house (Clue 4), the only possible position for the swimmer is House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Finally, we use Clue 2: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can deduce the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's place the known information:
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)

From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the root beer lover is in house 3, the only possibility is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green. From clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know that the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio. Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio. Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

3. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
5. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
6. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
7. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.

14. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
15. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
16. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. Since the first and second houses are already occupied, the person who owns horses must live in the first house.
- The bird keeper and the fish enthusiast are one house apart. Since the first house is occupied by the person who owns horses and the person who ate spaghetti, the bird keeper must live in the third house and the fish enthusiast in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the root beer lover must live in the third house and the romance book lover in the fourth house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other, so they must live in the fourth and fifth houses.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives. Since the person who owns horses lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the fifth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first, third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the first, third, and fourth houses are already occupied, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house. Since the first, second, and fifth houses are already occupied, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.
- The person who likes yellow and the romance book lover are two houses apart. Since the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the tea drinker must live in the first house and the person who likes white in the second house.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the first house (Clue 5).
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house (Clue 8).
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist (Clue 1). Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the cellist must be in the third house.
4. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist (Clue 2). Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives (Clue 3). Since the guitarist is in the second house and the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
6. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other (Clue 10). Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 11). This is consistent with the previous deduction.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis (Clue 12). Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (Clue 4). Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house (Clue 6). This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house (Clue 7). This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper (Clue 9). Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to determine the house number where the person who had stew lives. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know that the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples. From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis. From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - If the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other.

Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio (because they are next to each other).

So, the second house has:
- Radio
- Horses

The first house has:
- Phone
- Boots

The only characteristic left is high heels, which must belong to the person in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

First, we know the baseball player is in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

11. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 11, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the answer is:

(E) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Let's assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, let's consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

From Clue 2 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - So, House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - So, House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

9. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Next, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3:

- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Now, let's use Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Next, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Now, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The history book buff lives in the first house (option B).
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **House 1: Soccer player**
2. **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
3. **House 3: Kiwi eater**
4. **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
5. **House 5: Not flutist (clue 16)**

20. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
21. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
22. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- **House 2: Apples eater**

"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in house 4 owns an SUV.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3 because the sedan is in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player cannot be in House 3 (since the cat lover is there), so the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the soccer player would be in House 2, and the truck driver would be in House 3.
   - This arrangement fits all the clues.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 1.

From Clue 8, the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house. But the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house (Clue 7), so it must be in the second house, and the rose bouquet in the first house.

From Clue 9, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the gameboy. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the gameboy would be in the second house, but the rose bouquet is in the first house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the gameboy in the second house.

From Clue 10, the television is not in the second house, so it must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television must be in the first or fifth house.

From Clue 11, the fish enthusiast is to the left of the bouquet of daffodils. If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the fish enthusiast would be in the first house.

From Clue 12, the bird keeper is to the right of the convertible. If the convertible is in the first house, the bird keeper would be in the second house, but the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, so the convertible must be in the third house, and the bird keeper in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the guitarist is to the left of the horses. If the horses are in the fifth house, the guitarist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the horses must be in the fifth house, and the guitarist in the third house.

From Clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the SUV live next to each other. If the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the SUV would be in the second house.

From Clue 15, the percussionist is to the left of the carnations. If the carnations are in the fifth house, the percussionist would be in the fourth house, but the bird keeper is in the fourth house, so the carnations must be in the fifth house, and the percussionist in the fourth house.

From Clue 17, the pianist is to the left of the SUV. If the SUV is in the second house, the pianist would be in the first house.

From Clue 18, the percussionist is to the left of the cat lover. If the percussionist is in the fourth house, the cat lover would be in the fifth house.

From Clue 19, the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the guitarist. If the bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the guitarist would be in the second house, but the rose bouquet is in the first house, so the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the guitarist in the second house.

But the first house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.

- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the minivan is in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
    - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3. 

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the swimmer is not in house 1, so the swimmer is in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

However, we already know the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, so this is a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate:

- The fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house because the second and third houses are already occupied.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

   - This means the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This is already covered by Clue 1, so we know the tea drinker is in house 2 and the person with a television is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the flutist and the banana eater are in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, it must be 1 and 3).

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Television, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the root beer lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the banana eater must live in House 4.

Now, we know:
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

3. **Clue 1:** The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the history book buff must live in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. So, the person eating apples must live in either House 1 or House 2. But House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so the person eating apples must live in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. So, the person wearing running shoes must live in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

6. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 1, the person eating mangos must live in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

7. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in House 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals

- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic, eating banana

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 4.

"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

3. **Clue 3:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above, we know:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist must be wearing loafers.

Now, we need to determine the shoe type for the person in the second house. We know:
- The person in the second house is not wearing loafers (since the first house person is wearing loafers).
- The person in the second house is not wearing sandals (since loafers and sandals are the only two options left for the second house).

Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the person who only drinks water. Since they do not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, let's use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The answer is:

From these clues, we can start placing some information:

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Next, we use Clue 5 and 19:
- The person who likes red must be in House 1, 2, or 4 (since it can't be in House 5).
- The person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5 (since it must be to the right of the person who likes white).

From Clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone:

- If the person with a gameboy is in House 2, the person with sandals must be in House 1.
- If the person with a gameboy is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 1 or 2.
- If the person with a gameboy is in House 4, the person with sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the person with a gameboy is in House 5, the person with sandals must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 10, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives:
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio:
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 1, the person with a radio must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 2, the person with a radio must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the person with a radio must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 4, the person with a radio must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover:
- If the cat lover is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 5.

By analyzing all the clues and using the process of elimination, we can deduce that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person with a television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- From Clue 2, the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Let's consider both possibilities:
  - Pizza eater in house 1, history book buff in house 2
  - Pizza eater in house 2, history book buff in house 1

- If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2). This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1). This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From Clue 10, the bird keeper is in house 5, so the bird keeper cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in house 5, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. But house 4 is occupied by the violinist, so they must be in houses 3 and 2.

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Person who owns horses

From Clue 4, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. The only possible pair is (2, 3), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the flutist and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Person who owns horses
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

From Clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. The only possible pair is (2, 3), but house 2 is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person with a television and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 3 and 4.

- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Violinist

"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This means House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From these deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the correct house number for the cricketer.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 2), but House 4 is taken by the golfer. Therefore, the soccer player must be in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4.

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the possible arrangement:
- If the person who likes white lives in house 1, then the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other, so the baseball player must live in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti in house 2.

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to determine the house number of the root beer lover.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. So, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker must live in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and Clue 2 (revisited):** If the root beer lover lives in the third house, the water drinker must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

- The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in either the first or the third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses step by step.

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know:
- The person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:
- Clue 3 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes, the grilled cheese and white preferences must be in the second and third houses.
- Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- Clue 5 tells us that the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.
- Clue 2 tells us that the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.
- Clue 4 tells us that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is consistent.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{2}."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible also lives in the second house.

Since the baseball player lives in the second house and drives a convertible, the person in the first house must be the cricketer. Also, since the person in the second house is eating grapes, the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the person who likes white lives.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in House 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1 because the mystery book reader is in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- The dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- The person who likes yellow (in the third house) lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must live in the first house. Therefore, the white person must live in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

- The person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in the first house.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in the third house (Clue 1), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating grapes is in the first house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.
- The basketball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house.
- The cat lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 2), so they must be in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third house.
- The dog owner cannot be in the third house (Clue 4), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the person who is eating grapes is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house.
- The person who likes green cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), so they must be in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the person who likes green must be in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 5, and the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.

2. **The person who owns horses lives in the first house.**
   - Horse owner: House 1.

3. **The root beer lover does not live in the first house.**
   - Root beer lover: Houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

5. **There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the pianist are 2 houses apart.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

15. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.**
    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the fifth house (Clue 7).

Next, let's use Clue 10: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's use Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Let's use Clue 13: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 1: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.

Using Clue 3: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 4: The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Using Clue 5: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Using Clue 6: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 8: The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes white must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 9: The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3 or 4.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - Since the cellist lives in house 1, the dog owner cannot live there. Therefore, the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone must be in House 2 and the SUV in House 4.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4 (since House 4 is the only house to the right of House 3).

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - So, the convertible must be in House 1, House 2, or House 4. But House 1 is already taken by the minivan, and House 4 is taken by the radio, so the convertible must be in House 2.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - So, the computer must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

Now, we can fill in the houses:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone and Convertible
- House 3: Gameboy and Computer
- House 4: SUV and Radio

From this, we can see that the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 3:** Vase of tulips (Clue 3)
- **House 2:** Computer (Clue 6)

From Clue 2, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with the television must be in House 2. However, House 2 is already occupied by the computer, so this is not possible. Therefore, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with the television must be in House 3.

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 3:** Television

From Clue 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone. Since the person with the phone is in House 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is occupied by the computer, and House 3 is occupied by the television. Therefore, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio. Since the person with the radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), the person with the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 is occupied by the phone, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, so the person with the radio must be in House 3. This means:

- **House 3:** Radio

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

Now, we have:

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 2:** Computer
- **House 3:** Radio, Television
- **House 4:** Bouquet of lilies
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

From Clue 7, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 1 (phone), House 2 (computer), or House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), the only possible positions are House 3 and House 4. But House 3 is occupied by the radio and television, so the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 4, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 4:** Rose bouquet
- **House 5:** Carnations arrangement

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer (Clue 1) and Fish enthusiast (Clue 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house (House 2).

From Clue 4, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. This means the person eating grapes lives in House 1 and the person with a computer lives in House 2.

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a computer).

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and fill in the information:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Let's solve the problem step by step using the given clues.

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the person with lilies must be the golfer, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be the basketball player.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the basketball player (grilled cheese) is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (the soccer player).

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips is in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the basketball player in house 2 must have tulips.

So, we have:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The pianist lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can place:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, let's consider the remaining clues:
4. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
9. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
10. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
11. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 7, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the pianist. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in House 5.

From Clue 9, the percussionist and the cellist live next to each other. Since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist and cellist must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist and cellist must be in Houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 6, the pianist lives to the right of the percussionist. Therefore, the percussionist must live in House 1 and the cellist in House 2.

From Clue 4, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the cellist is in House 2, the person who had stew must live in House 1, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 8, there are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes white must live in House 5.

From Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in house 3:

- House 3: Tea drinker

Next, we know the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 or 3.

- House 1 or 2: Stew
- House 2 or 3: Spaghetti

The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 or 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

- House 1 or 2: Sandals
- House 2, 3, or 4: Root beer lover

The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, it must be in house 2, 3, or 4, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

- House 2, 3, or 4: Grilled cheese
- House 2, 3, or 4: Water

The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3.

- House 1 or 2: Running shoes
- House 2 or 3: Stew

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

- House 2 or 3: High heels, Water

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be next to the person who is wearing high heels, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

- House 2: Grilled cheese, Water

This means the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 1.

- House 1: High heels

Now, the person who had stew must be in house 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

- House 3: Stew
- House 4: Spaghetti

The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew

Finally, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 4.

- House 2: Sandals
- House 4: Root beer lover

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 6**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Basketball player

3. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white cannot live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.
- House 1: Pianist, likes white

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover must be to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Since the person who likes white (and is a pianist) is in house 1, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2 (because the root beer lover would then have to be in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist is there).

Therefore:
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

The only pet left is a dog, and the only color left is white, but since the person in house 1 already likes white, the dog owner must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(B) 2**."

1. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

Using clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, using clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. Since the violinist cannot be in house 4, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Using clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Combining all the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

   - House 1: White

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not boots

3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Apple eater
- House 3: Apple eater (but this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Since the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since the coffee drinker is not in house 2 and must be left of the milk drinker).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

- The person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, or the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

Since House 2 is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

From Clue 7, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes red must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

From Clue 1, since the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house (because there is one house between them).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only drink left is water, and the only flower left is a rose bouquet. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Now, let's fill in the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)

The answer is (A) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the pizza eater cannot be in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the fried rice eater is to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This means the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the green lover must be in the second house because the green lover lives to the left of the history book buff, who is in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the correct arrangement.

### Clues Recap:
1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. So, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to determine the house number for each characteristic. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The swimmer lives in the third house.**
   - Swimmer: House 3

2. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the person with a vase of tulips is in House X+1.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - If the person with running shoes is in House Y, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House Y+1.

5. **The violinist lives in the second house.**
   - Violinist: House 2

6. **The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - If the guitarist is in House Z, then the basketball player is in House Z-1.

7. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - If the person with high heels is in House W, then the bouquet of lilies is in a house to the right of W.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - If the percussionist is in House P, then the person with loafers is in House P-1.

9. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Cricketer: House 4

10. **The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the baseball player and the basketball player are in consecutive houses.

11. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.**
    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**
    - If the person with sandals is in House X, then the cellist is in House X+3.

Now, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:

- From Clue 1, the swimmer is in House 3.
- From Clue 5, the violinist is in House 2.
- From Clue 9, the cricketer is in House 4.
- From Clue 11, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5.

Since the basketball player and the guitarist are next to each other, and the basketball player is to the left of the guitarist, and the guitarist is to the right of the violinist (House 2), the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 6, the basketball player (House 3) is directly left of the guitarist (House 4), which is consistent.

From Clue 2, the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist (House 4), so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the guitarist. Therefore, the person with running shoes must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 5.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2
- Violinist: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 on the left and 2 on the right.
2. Each person has a different pet: one is a dog owner and one is a fish enthusiast.

- The person in house 1 is wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Now, we need to determine what the person in house 1 ate. We know:
- House 1: High heels, Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must have eaten stew.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 6**: The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From these clues, we know the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. **Clue 9**: The person with a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. **Clue 14**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
   - This aligns with the previous clue, confirming the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

6. **Clue 12**: The person with a radio does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 13**: The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

8. **Clue 1**: The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other.

10. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives to the left of the person wearing boots.
11. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, so the romance book lover is in the first house.

12. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives to the left of the person eating oranges.
13. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between the person wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast.
14. **Clue 8**: The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, the person with a radio does not live in the second house, so the person with a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person with a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person with a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 11, the history book buff lives to the left of the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses. So, the sequence is: pizza, yellow, tea.

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater. So, the sequence is: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
- The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

From Clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
- The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. But House 4 already has the Television, so the phone must be in either House 1 or 3.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's figure out the house numbers and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

This leaves the first house for the person wearing loafers.

Now, let's assign the drinks:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, and their characteristics.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by placing the running shoes and the rose bouquet next to each other, as per Clue 1 and Clue 8. Since the person with running shoes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), the only possible positions are:

- House 1: Running shoes, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Rose bouquet

Next, let's place the person with a vase of tulips directly left of the person who had pizza (Clue 4). This means:

- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
- If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

Since the person with sandals is to the right of the person with carnations (Clue 5), and the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals (Clue 2), we can deduce:

- If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 3.
- If the person with sandals is in House 3, the person with carnations is in House 2.
- If the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with carnations is in House 1.

The person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew (Clue 6), and the person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio (Clue 7). The person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza (Clue 9), and the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio (Clue 10).

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the house to the left of the person with the lilies. This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house. Therefore, the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From this, we can deduce:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

So, the person eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the swimmer must be in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
6. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
9. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the person who has a phone must be in the fifth house.
10. The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
12. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the person who likes milk must be in the fifth house.
13. The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so the golfer must be in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Since the SUV cannot be in house 2 in both scenarios, we need to re-evaluate the placement of the rose bouquet and the sedan.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, their musical instruments, flowers, drinks, and favorite books. Let's go through the clues step by step and use a process of elimination and deduction.

1. The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
7. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

10. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
11. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
14. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Now, let's use Clue 3 and Clue 4 to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we need to find a way to fit these pairs into the remaining houses.

Let's use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Let's use Clue 13 to place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

Using Clue 12 and Clue 14, we can place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 8, we know the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. And using Clue 1, we know the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.
4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. The person who likes yellow is in the first house, so the swimmer cannot be in the first house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.
7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.
8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.
9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.
10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.
11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.
12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. But since house 2 is already taken by the yellow lover, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1 and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. So, House 1 has carnations.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, House 3 has yellow.
3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since House 1 has carnations and House 3 has yellow, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
5. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in House 2, the horses and blue must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 3 has yellow, so the horses and blue must be in House 1.
6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. But House 2 has the vase of tulips and the bird keeper, so the percussionist and the truck must be in House 1 and 3.
7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3. But House 2 has the vase of tulips and the bird keeper, so the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Carnations, blue car, percussionist
- House 2: Tulips, bird keeper
- House 3: Yellow, horses

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and clue 2, we know that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist.

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house.

So, we can conclude:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast and cellist, likes green.
- House 2: Mystery book reader, likes red.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - This means the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer lives in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer lives in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. But the golfer is in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

So, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater

- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who owns horses must be in House 4:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Finally, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Let's break down the clues and see what we can deduce:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Given these clues, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals. This scenario is consistent with all clues.

- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff. But this would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals. This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Now, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Since we need to find the house number where the person who ate fried rice lives, and based on the consistency of the clues, we can conclude:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - Since the rose bouquet is in the third house, the daffodils must be in the first house.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Since the rose bouquet is in the third house, they must be in the first and second houses.

Next, use Clue 4:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house and the swimmer is in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, use Clue 2:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, use Clue 5:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The daffodils are in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Finally, use Clue 7:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Now, use Clue 9:
- There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the correct houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

5. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist does not live in the second house.
6. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 8:** The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
8. **Clue 9:** The violinist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.
12. **Clue 13:** The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 14:** The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.
14. **Clue 15:** The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 16:** The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
16. **Clue 17:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 3:** Coffee drinker (Clue 3)
- **House 5:** Milk drinker (Clue 14)
- **House 5:** Television (Clue 15)

Since the television cannot be in House 5, we need to re-evaluate. Let's place the television in House 4 (Clue 11).

Now, let's place the gameboy and computer:

- **Clue 5:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
- **Clue 12:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.

This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1, and the carnations arrangement must be in House 2 (since the percussionist must be to the right of the carnations arrangement).

- **House 2:** Carnations arrangement
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

Now, let's place the root beer lover:

- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a rose bouquet lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the root beer lover cannot be in House 3. The only possible positions for the root beer lover are House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Given the two flowers are one house apart, and considering the other placements, the root beer lover must be in House 1.

- **House 1:** Root beer lover

Now, let's place the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 10:** The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 16:** The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.

Given the placements, the only possible positions for the phone and vase of tulips are House 4 and 5, and the only possible positions for the water drinker and saxophonist are House 2 and 3.

- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

Finally, the remaining flowers and drinks:

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Water drinker
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker
- **House 4:** Gameboy
- **House 5:** Computer

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

Thus, the answer is:
**(E) 5**"
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

3. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist are in consecutive houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

4. **Clue 10**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the root beer lover is in a house to the left of the percussionist.

5. **Clue 15**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the cellist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

6. **Clue 3**: The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are in consecutive houses, with the cellist to the left.

7. **Clue 11**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses, with the person who ate spaghetti to the left.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue are three houses apart.

10. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
    - This means the person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of House 3.

11. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

12. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

13. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and use a process of elimination.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red
- The person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3.
- The person who likes yellow lives in House 3, 4, or 5.

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and the person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, the only consistent placement for the person who likes green is House 5. This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively.

Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

From Clue 1, the computer must be in house 1 and the root beer lover in house 2.

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and they are next to each other).

From Clue 7, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3, so it must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 13, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5 (since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3).

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4 or 5. Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 4 or 5, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the percussionist must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the phone and the television. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5 (since the cellist is in house 5).

From Clue 12, the root beer lover (house 2) lives to the left of the percussionist (house 5).

From Clue 10, the coffee drinker (house 3) lives to the right of the milk drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).

From Clue 11, the guitarist (house 3) lives to the right of the phone (house 1).

From Clue 16, the tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), the tea drinker is in house 1 and the pianist is in house 5.

From Clue 9, the cellist does not live in house 4, so the cellist is in house 5.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the phone and house 2 is the root beer lover, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

Let's start placing the known information:
- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the minivan cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:
- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:
- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

From Clues 5 and 6, we see that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues. Let's assume the saxophonist and the basketball player are in different houses:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- House 2: Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person in the first house, who is a history book buff, a cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

3. **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here (Clue 10 and 10).
4. **House 1:** The person who had pizza lives here (Clue 10 and 10).

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3, but we already know House 3 is for the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 4.

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 2:** The history book buff lives here, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live directly left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 1). So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.
- **House 1:** The person who had pizza lives here, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives here. The person who likes yellow must live in House 3.
- **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here, and the person who likes yellow lives here.
- **House 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here, and the person who ate spaghetti lives here.

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow
- **House 4:** White, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), the person who likes white must be in House 3, and the romance book lover must be in House 4.

- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips, White, Romance book lover
- **House 4:** White, Fantasy book enthusiast, Romance book lover

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Fantasy book enthusiast, Romance book lover

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Clue 1: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
This means the pianist and the kiwi-eater are in adjacent houses.

#### Clue 2: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

#### Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

#### Clue 4: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, but this contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who likes red.

1. The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, the person who likes red lives in the third house, and the person who has a radio also lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow, which is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who has a television lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the first house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

From the clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3.

- The swimmer, the person who likes white, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left, the person who likes white in the middle, and the person who only drinks water on the right.

From Clue 9, we know:
- The tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the tea drinker.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The baseball player does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

From Clue 6, we know:

3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

1. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Next, let's use **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- The romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Since the carnations arrangement must be in the second house (as the romance book lover is to the right of it), the carnations arrangement is in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using **Clue 3** again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

(C) 4"
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1), the coffee drinker must be in the first house as well because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- This means the person in the second house (House 2) must be wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

2. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
3. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
4. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.

From clue 1, we know that the percussionist must live in house 1 because house 1 is to the left of house 2. Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 2 (because the person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who owns a sedan), the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.
- The person who likes white must be in house 3, as there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: White

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

   - If the bird keeper is in House 4, the sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in House 5, the sandals must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives.
   - Since the running shoes are in House 1, the bird keeper must be in House 4 (2 houses to the right).

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Not high heels

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house and is also the fantasy book enthusiast, we can place them there.

From clue 2, we know:
- The science fiction book fanatic must live to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti must live to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
- Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the first and second houses are already filled, the person in the third house must have eaten grilled cheese and be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the clues provided, we know:
1. The person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner.
2. The houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right).

Since the carnations must be to the left of the dog, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water (because the person in house 2 cannot be drinking water as per clue 1).

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals as per clue 2).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

So, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1: Grapes, House 2: Sandals
- House 1: Sandals, House 2: Grapes

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in the left house (House 1) if the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in the left house (House 1) if the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

Combining these clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per Clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (since the only fruit left is kiwis).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Given that the tea drinker is in house 1, let's place the other people:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This means the cellist must be in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This would place the water drinker in house 3. This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the problem step by step using the given clues.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From Clue 6 and Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Pizza
- House 4 cannot be the computer, so the computer must be in either House 1, 2, or 3.
- House 4 cannot be the radio, so the radio must be in either House 1, 2, or 3.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From Clue 3, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
- Since House 3 is the grilled cheese, the radio must be in House 1 or House 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The gameboy and the computer are next to each other.
- Since the radio is in House 1 or House 2, the gameboy and computer must be in House 2 and House 3, or House 3 and House 4. But House 4 is already the pizza, so the gameboy and computer must be in House 1 and House 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Given the clues, let's figure out where each person lives based on the information provided:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the percussionist lives in house 1. Since the bird keeper cannot live in house 2 (as per Clue 1), the bird keeper must live in house 1. However, this contradicts Clue 1, so the bird keeper must live in house 2.

Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (to the left of house 2).

Therefore, the pizza eater must live in house 2.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. So, the cat lover is in House 1.

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 5: The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- Clue 8: The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- Clue 6: The flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1.
- Clue 7: The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1.
- Clue 2: The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.
- Clue 4: The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.
- Clue 3: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.
- Clue 1: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes. This is because the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.

- House 2: Person wearing running shoes

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).
- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).
- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).
- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Grapes.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who likes red cannot be in houses 1 and 3 or 3 and 4. They must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - This means the person who is eating kiwis cannot be in house 3 or 4, and the person who likes red must be in house 3 or 4.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana cannot be in houses 1 and 3 or 3 and 4. They must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Green.
- House 4: Yellow.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who likes red and the person who likes green must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since House 1 is Green, the person who likes red must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes red (House 3) lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 1.

From Clue 3, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in House 1 and the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who is eating a banana must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader on the left.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader on the left. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the cat lover is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 1, and the person who had stew must be in house 2.

- Since the television is in House 3, the vase of tulips must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the water drinker is in House 2, the daffodils and phone must be in Houses 1 and 3. Given that the vase of tulips is in House 1, the daffodils must be in House 3, and the phone must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.

From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.

From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.

From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.

From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

12. **Clue 6**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
    - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the phone must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 1: Not Green, Not Radio
- House 2: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 4: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 5: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3. From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 1.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house. This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot live in house 3 (since there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must live in house 1.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

Given these constraints:
- The dog owner is in house 1.
- The bird keeper must be in house 2.
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - House 3: Vase of tulips
   - House 4: Cricketer

3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - House 1 or 2: High heels
   - House 3: Vase of tulips

4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Eating apples

5. There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 3.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 4.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 4, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 2.

6. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 1, 3, or 4: Wearing loafers

7. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1 or 2: Phone
   - House 2 or 3: Sandals

8. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1 or 2: Eating oranges
   - House 2 or 3: Computer

9. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Bouquet of lilies

10. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
    - House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

11. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - House 1: Rose bouquet
    - House 2: Eating banana

12. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person with a banana is in House 2. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mangos

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

From clue 6, the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- House 2: Banana
- House 3: Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- House 1: Mangos (from clue 1)
- House 4: Kiwi

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- House 1: Mangos, Bird Keeper
- House 2: Banana, Dog Owner
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- House 4: Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
3. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
4. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 4, we know:
- The bird keeper must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

Since the bird keeper is in the second house and the history book buff is in the third house, the only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover cannot be in the third house, which is consistent with our deduction.

From clue 3, the person who owns horses cannot be in the third house, so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first or third house. Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. But we already know the fourth house is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent.
5. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person eating apples, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must be in the first house.

So, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. Mangos

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this needs to be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, which aligns with clue 7. 

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

First, let's place the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, using Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. So, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, using Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, using Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, using Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's use the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:

- If the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2, and the minivan must be in house 3 (since the minivan is to the right of the truck).
- If the truck is in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 3, but this would violate Clue 6, as the flutist cannot be in house 0.

So, the truck must be in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the minivan in house 3.

Now, the minivan and cellist are adjacent (Clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 2.

The flutist is directly left of the minivan (Clue 6), so the flutist must be in house 1.

The high heels and television are adjacent (Clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (Clue 7). Since the flutist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 3 (the only remaining house).

Now, we need to assign the shoes, devices, and cars:

- The flutist (house 1) must have a device and a car. Since the minivan is in house 3, the flutist cannot have a minivan. The gameboy is in house 2, so the flutist must have a phone or a television. The television is adjacent to high heels, so the flutist must have a phone.
- The cellist (house 2) must have a gameboy or a television. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the cellist must have a television.
- The percussionist (house 3) must have a gameboy or a phone. Since the gameboy is in house 2 and the flutist has a phone, the percussionist must have a gameboy.
- The high heels and television are adjacent, so the percussionist must have high heels.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 4"
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues provided:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the coffee drinker must be in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan (house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 3).

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 1, and the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- Since the person who has a rose bouquet (house 1) likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes red does not live in the first house, so they must live in house 2 or 3.
- Since the person who ate spaghetti (house 2) likes red, the person who likes green must live in house 3.

Summarizing:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given the above, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

From clue 10, we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Bird keeper

From clue 9, since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

From clue 9 and clue 7, since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (because the person who ate grilled cheese is to the left of the guitarist).

From clue 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 4 (because the guitarist is in house 3 and the person who had pizza is to the right of the guitarist).

From clue 4, the violinist must be in house 1 or house 3, but since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater and house 3 is occupied by the guitarist, the violinist must be in house 1, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 3.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

2. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.

Let's start by organizing the clues and making deductions:

- From Clue 2, the root beer lover and the person wearing high heels must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 3, the basketball player and the tennis player must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 4, the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing loafers must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 5, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza must be in consecutive houses.
- From Clue 6, the soccer player must be to the right of the person who had stew.
- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the cricketer.
- From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the fifth house.
- From Clue 9, the person who only drinks water must be to the left of the tea drinker.
- From Clue 10, the person who only drinks water must be to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 11, the cricketer must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
- From Clue 12, the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.
- From Clue 13, the person who is wearing boots must be to the left of the basketball player.

- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti (from Clue 4 and Clue 5)
- House 4: Person who had pizza (from Clue 5)

Now, we need to fit the remaining characteristics:

- The root beer lover and the person wearing high heels must be in consecutive houses (Clue 2).
- The basketball player and the tennis player must be in consecutive houses (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing boots must be to the left of the basketball player (Clue 13).
- The soccer player must be to the right of the person who had stew (Clue 6).

Given the constraints, the only logical arrangement is:

- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who had pizza
- House 5: Person who had stew

Thus, the tea drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is (E) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in house \( n \), the person who had pizza is in house \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - The tea drinker is in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
   - The vase of tulips is in house 5.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - These two must be in consecutive houses.

10. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - If the person who likes white is in house \( n \), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house \( n+2 \) or \( n-2 \).

11. **Clue 11:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
    - The root beer lover is not in house 3.

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - The coffee drinker is in a house to the left of the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White
- House 3: Daffodils

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their cars, flowers, sports, lunch, and pets. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 12 and 13**:
   - The first house has a vase of tulips and someone who ate spaghetti.

2. **Clue 14**:
   - The rose bouquet is not in the second house.

3. **Clue 15**:
   - The soccer player lives to the right of the baseball player. This means the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. But since the first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti, the baseball player and tennis player cannot be in houses 1 and 2. Thus, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 7**:
   - The bouquet of lilies is to the right of the soccer player. This means the soccer player cannot be in house 4, and the lilies owner cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 8**:
   - The minivan and convertible live next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

7. **Clue 10**:
   - The rose bouquet is to the right of the sedan. This means the sedan cannot be in house 4, and the rose bouquet cannot be in house 1.

8. **Clue 3**:
   - The sedan is to the left of the truck. This means the sedan cannot be in house 4, and the truck cannot be in house 1.

10. **Clue 1**:
    - The truck is not in the second house.

11. **Clue 4**:
    - The bird keeper is to the left of the cat lover. This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 4, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

12. **Clue 5**:
    - The fish enthusiast is to the left of the stew eater. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 4, and the stew eater cannot be in house 1.

Given the constraints, let's start placing the known elements:

- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti
- House 2: (Baseball player, Tennis player, Minivan/Convertible)
- House 3: (Sedan/Truck, Lilies)
- House 4: (Soccer player, Cat lover, Stew, Truck/Minivan)

From Clue 6, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is to the left of the tennis player, the baseball player is in house 2 and the tennis player is in house 3.

From Clue 8, the minivan and convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From Clue 3, the sedan must be in house 3, and the truck in house 4.

From Clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 9, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 10, the rose bouquet must be in house 4.

From Clue 11, the stew eater must be in house 4.

From Clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2, so it must be in house 4.

From Clue 15, the soccer player must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."

### Combining the Clues:

- If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then:
  - The person who likes yellow is in house 1.

  - The mystery book reader is in house 2.

This combination satisfies all the clues:

- The person in house 1 (who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots) must be the one who drives a convertible (since the other person drives a truck).
- The person in house 2 (who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader) must like red, eat oranges, and wear running shoes.

### Conclusion:
The fantasy book enthusiast must be the person in house 1, as the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

    - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 5, the person who had pizza must be in House"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's go through the clues step by step and use a process of elimination to determine the correct house for each characteristic.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given clues:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we know that the second house is occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist. This seems contradictory, so let's re-evaluate the clues. It's possible that the clues are referring to different characteristics of the people.

Given the clues:
- The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
- The basketball player lives in the second house.
- The violinist lives in the second house.

Since the violinist and the basketball player cannot both live in the second house, let's assume the second house is occupied by one of these people and the other person's characteristic is in the first or third house.

Let's place the cricketer in the first house. Then, the cellist must be in the third house (since the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer).

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Now, the basketball player must be in the first or third house, but since the cricketer is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house. This leaves the soccer player in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we know:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The person with a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist is in house 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 because they are next to each other.

So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Let's solve this step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover and the soccer player are the same person, which is not possible. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

- **House 2: Boots**
- **House 3: TV, Daffodils**
- **House 4: Pizza**
- **House 5: Computer, Tulips**

From clue 16, **Running Shoes and Computer next to each other**, and since Computer is in House 5, Running Shoes must be in House 4.

- **House 4: Pizza, Running Shoes**
- **House 5: Computer, Tulips, Carnations**

- **House 3: TV, Daffodils, History Book**
- **House 4: Pizza, Running Shoes**
- **House 5: Computer, Tulips, Carnations, Lilies**

- **House 2: Boots**
- **House 3: TV, Daffodils, History Book**
- **House 4: Pizza, Running Shoes**
- **House 5: Computer, Tulips, Carnations, Lilies, Stew**

- **House 2: Boots**
- **House 3: TV, Daffodils, History Book**
- **House 4: Pizza, Running Shoes, Phone**
- **House 5: Computer, Tulips, Carnations, Lilies, Stew, Sandals, High Heels, Mystery Book, Loafers**

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, we need to determine who is wearing running shoes. Since the cat lover is in House 1, the fish enthusiast must be in House 2 (wearing high heels), and the dog owner is in House 3, the only person left is the one in House 3, who is wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses. But the third house is already occupied by the tea drinker, so they must be in the first and second houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house and the person who is wearing boots is in the second house, the person who likes green must be in the third house. But the third house is already occupied by the tea drinker, so the person who is wearing boots must be in the second house and the person who likes green must be in the third house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house. But the first house already has the green person, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples are next to each other and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

"Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

So, we have:

A 1943-S penny is not suitable for making silverware. This penny contains a small amount of silver, but it also includes copper and manganese, which are not ideal materials for silverware. Silverware needs to be made from pure or nearly pure silver to meet quality and hygiene standards. Using coins for this purpose is impractical and not recommended due to the presence of other metals and the potential value of the coin itself."
"(B) Yes

Simon Cowell is not eligible to vote for the next Supreme Court judge. The process for appointing Supreme Court justices involves the President nominating a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate.

Apollo, a figure from Greek mythology, is known for his numerous divine abilities, including superhuman strength and speed. On the other hand, D'Artagnan is a skilled human swordsman from the novel ""The Three Musketeers."" While D'Artagnan is brave and skilled with a sword, Apollo's divine powers would likely give him an advantage in a physical confrontation. Therefore, it is unlikely that all of the famous Apollo's could defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's."

"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is used to disinfect water, but it needs time to dissipate and ensure it's at a safe level.

Always follow local guidelines to ensure your water is safe."
"(B) No

A dichromat, or someone with color vision deficiency, would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color.

"(A) Yes

Elizabeth I ruled from 1558 to 1603. ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was written by Christopher Marlowe and first performed around 1587.

The most expensive color in the world isn't necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary depending on the material and how it's used. For example, some rare pigments like lapis lazuli, which were used to make ultramarine, have been very expensive historically.

Both would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which requires following specific procedures and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner."
"(A) No

In some cases, high levels of lactic acid can be a sign of a medical condition, but this is rare and usually related to other health issues."

"(B) No

The Virginia General Assembly has 140 seats, with 100 in the House of Delegates and 40 in the Senate. The Swiss Guard, which is based in Vatican City, has around 135 members.

Therefore, it's plausible that Bart could own a comic featuring The Joker."

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can both be used to create strong passwords. A strong password should include a mix of different character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (which consist of 0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (which includes A-Z and a-z) can contribute to the complexity of a password when combined with other character types. However, it's important to ensure the password is long (at least 12-16 characters), random, and not based on easily guessable information."
"(A) No

Lunch on the beach is a nice activity, but it's not the best way to spot a full circle of a rainbow.

White rice and sesame seeds can both spoil, but they do so in different ways. Sesame seeds can go rancid because they contain fats that can break down over time, especially if exposed to air, light, or heat.

While ""The Jungle Book"" was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which were times when racial stereotypes were common, the story itself can be interpreted in various ways. Many people today see the themes of friendship, family, and the struggle between nature and civilization as universal and timeless. Additionally, modern adaptations often focus on making the story more inclusive and less problematic. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that the book contains clear racist subtext."
"(A) No

In the 1980s, China had a one-child policy in most urban areas, meaning families were generally allowed to have only one child.

In Islam, the focus is on the prophets and their teachings as described in the Quran and Hadith.

"(B) Yes

The 1980 Summer Olympics, also known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad, took place in Moscow. ""The Atlantic"" magazine has been around since 1857, so it would have been available during that time. Therefore, it is possible to read ""The Atlantic"" magazine during the 1980 Summer Olympics."

A paraplegic can certainly conduct an orchestra. Conducting an orchestra mainly involves musical skills, leadership, and the ability to communicate with musicians through gestures.

What's important is the conductor's musical talent and ability to lead the orchestra."

Therefore, a Bengal cat could not hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record."
"(A) Yes

"(A) No

In the United States, there are specific age requirements for driving, and these are typically set at 16 years old. Even if a child is licensed to drive a Mercedes-Benz, they would still need to meet other legal requirements for employment, which often include age restrictions.
