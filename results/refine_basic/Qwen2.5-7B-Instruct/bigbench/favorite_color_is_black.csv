The correct answer is: (A) 1."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the correct houses based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Radio
- House 3 or 4: Carnations

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 1 or 4: Banana (one house between them)

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 7, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 13, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we need to place the devices and pets.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

"The person who likes green lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve the logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 1"
The number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\).
The person who owns a sedan lives in house number (B) 3.
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the houses based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
7. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
9. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.
"The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

(D) 2"

- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Here are the clues and the process to deduce the correct placement:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the cellist in House 1 and then use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Now, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"

1. The fish enthusiast lives in house 1.
2. The dog owner lives in house 2.
3. The minivan owner lives in house 3.
4. The truck owner lives in house 4.

This arrangement satisfies all the given clues:
- Clue 1: The minivan owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\).
"The number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

(D) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Starting with Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

Next, using Clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 13, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

    - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the phone must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

Let's start placing the known items:
- House 3: Green, Radio

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3.

From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Guitarist
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow

- House 5: White
