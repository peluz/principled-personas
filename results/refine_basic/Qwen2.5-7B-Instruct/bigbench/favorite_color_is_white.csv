"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The number of the house where the cellist lives is:

(B) 2"
"The number of the house where the person who likes green lives is:

(C) 3

Here's the reasoning based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.
3. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.
5. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
8. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
10. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
11. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
12. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
14. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
15. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
16. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
17. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house. However, based on the clues and the need to fit all characteristics, the correct placement for the person who likes green is in the third house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 3"
The tea drinker lives in house number (A) 2.
The correct answer is (A) 5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as given in Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the house numbers for each person:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - If the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4.
   - If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4.
   - If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1.
   - If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's place the people:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who likes green lives in house 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the house numbers for each person's characteristics:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.

From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:
- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 1"
The number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\).

"The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
7. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
9. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.
"The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the fifth house, so red must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes white must be in House 1, 2, or 3, and stew must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone:
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 1, the person with a phone must be in House 2.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 2, the person with a phone must be in House 3.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the person with a phone must be in House 4.

- If the person with a gameboy is in House 4, the person with sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the person with a gameboy is in House 5, the person with sandals must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 10, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives:
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

From Clue 13, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover:
- If the cat lover is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers:
- If the person who is wearing loafers is in House 2, the person with a gameboy must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3, the person with a gameboy must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the person who is wearing loafers is in House 4, the person with a gameboy must be in House 5.

By analyzing all the clues and using the process of elimination, we can deduce that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"The person who has a computer lives in house number 2.

(A) 2"
"The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) 1"
The number of the house where the percussionist lives is (B) 2.
"The number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"The cricketer lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

Given Clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is (E) 4.
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Answer: (B) 2"
"The person who likes white lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve the logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics in the correct houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the cellist in House 1 and then use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Now, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The person who likes red lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) 1"
The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}.
"The cricketer lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the person who is eating grapes lives is (E) 1.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.

3. **Clue 3:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the fifth house (Clue 7).

Next, we use Clue 10: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 13: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 1: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.

Using Clue 3: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 4: The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Using Clue 5: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Using Clue 6: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 8: The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the person who likes white must be in house 3 or 4.

Using Clue 9: The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. This means the cricketer cannot be in house 5, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3 or 4.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"

Answer: (A) 2"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce:
- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"The number of the house where the person who likes red lives is (C) 3.

Here's the reasoning:
1. The fish enthusiast lives in House 1 (Clue 13).
2. The dog owner lives in House 3 (Clue 4).
3. The horse owner lives in House 4 (Clue 8).
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in House 4 (Clue 1), so they must live in House 2.
5. The person who is wearing high heels lives to the left of the dog owner (Clue 10), so they must live in House 2.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (Clue 6), so the person wearing sandals must live in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must live in House 2.
7. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in House 1 (Clue 7), so they must live in House 4.
8. The root beer lover lives to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 9), and since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must live in House 1, and the coffee drinker must live in House 2.
9. The person who likes white lives in House 3 (Clue 12).
10. There are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who owns a sedan (Clue 5), so the person who likes milk must live in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must live in House 4.
11. There is one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3), so the person who likes red must live in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3."

"Given the clues:
1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce the information step by step:

1. Since the pianist lives in the first house, the person in house 1 is a pianist.
2. The root beer lover must live to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2, as the root beer lover would then have to be in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist is in house 1.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

From the above points, we can conclude:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover, does not like white

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."

"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Given that the person in house 1 likes white, we can place the other characteristics as follows:

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 likes white, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots, and the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by grapes. Therefore, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

"The tea drinker lives in House 4.

Answer: (E) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the positions of each characteristic.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means if the person who likes blue is in house \( n \), the person who had pizza is in house \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - The tea drinker is in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

   - Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - The coffee drinker is in a house to the left of the house where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White
- House 3: Daffodils

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Water

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 3: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
The number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is (D) 3.
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 1"
The number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is (D) 2.
"The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is (C) 2.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
7. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
8. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
9. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
10. The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot be in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Pizza

The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 4: Golfer

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2."

In contrast, D'Artagnan is a skilled human swordsman from the novel ""The Three Musketeers."" While D'Artagnan is brave and skilled with a sword, Apollo's divine powers would likely give him an advantage in a physical confrontation. Therefore, it is unlikely that all of the famous Apollo's could defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's, even if multiple D'Artagnan figures were involved."

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are used to launch projectiles, they differ significantly in design, range, and operational requirements. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military contexts, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances.

"(A) No

While enjoying lunch on the beach can be a delightful experience, it is not an ideal activity for spotting a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows typically appear as semi-circular arcs in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed under specific conditions where the sun is at a low angle (below 42 degrees) and the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point. These conditions are not easily met by simply being on a beach."

Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language (ASL). While a person's dominant hand might play a role in their signing style, it does not dictate the specific signs or the way they are performed. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to whether a person is right-handed or left-handed. Factors that can influence signing include the signer's individual style, the context of the communication, and the signer's familiarity with ASL."

Therefore, it would be inaccurate to claim that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No
