The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The number of the house where the cellist lives is:

(C) 3"
"The number of the house where the person who likes green lives is:

(D) 1

To deduce this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The cricketer lives in the third house (next to the person who likes red).
- The tea drinker lives in the fourth house (directly left of the tennis player).
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house (right of the tea drinker).

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house."
The tea drinker lives in house number (A) 2.
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Based on the clues provided:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. This aligns with clue 1, confirming that the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. Clue 5 tells us that the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other (clue 7), and the person who had stew cannot be in the first house (clue 2), the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

- The person who drives a truck must be in House 3, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

From Clue 7, we know:
- There are two houses between the person who owns a sedan and the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 10, we know:
- There is one house between the person who likes green and the person who drives a truck.
- Since the person who drives a truck is in House 3, the person who likes green must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, we know:
- The person who owns an SUV cannot be in House 1.
- The person who owns an SUV must be in House 2, since House 1 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers.

Now, we can place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Yellow, Loafers
- House 2: Green, SUV
- House 3: Truck
- House 4: White, Sandals
- House 5: Blue

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red must be in House 5 (since the person who likes yellow is in House 1 and the person who likes green is in House 2).

From the clues, we can start placing some definite items:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Using Clue 12, we know the person who is wearing high heels is in House 2.

Using Clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 5.

Using Clue 4, the person who likes blue is in House 4.

Using Clue 17, the person who likes blue is in House 4.

Using Clue 10, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in Houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Using Clue 13, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. This means the cat lover must be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

Using Clue 14, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 4 or 5.

From the above deductions, the only consistent placement for the person who is wearing loafers is in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: (D) 4"
"To solve the logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Using Clue 5 and Clue 8, we need to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Using Clue 7 and Clue 10, we need to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Using Clue 7 and Clue 10, we need to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Using Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 4 and the cricketer in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Using Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the flutist, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Using Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

   - Swimmer (Clue 7)
   - Not the first house for the dog owner (Clue 4)
   - Not the first house for the bird keeper (Clue 14)
   - Not the first house for the computer owner (Clue 15)

5. **House 5:**

   - Not the first house for the bird keeper (Clue 14)
   - Not the first house for the computer owner (Clue 15)
   - Not the first house for the fish enthusiast (Clue 3)
   - Not the first house for the tennis player (Clue 5)
   - Not the first house for the radio owner (Clue 2)
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies (Clue 8)
   - Not the first house for the rose bouquet (Clue 16)

Now, let's use the clues to place the characteristics:

- **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
- **Clue 17:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house.
- **Clue 7:** The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 18:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent with the clues.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"The cricketer lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the person who is eating grapes lives is (E) 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
The correct answer is (B) 2. The dog owner lives in house 2 based on the given clues and logical deductions.
"The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\).
The number of the house where the tennis player lives is \(\boxed{4}\).
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and use each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Starting with Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

Next, using Clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5, with one house between them.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

From Clue 13, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5, with two houses between them.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player, so the tennis player cannot be in house 1, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 4, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist

From clue 3, we know:
- House 2: Cannot like white

Since the person in house 1 likes white, the person in house 2 cannot like white. Therefore, the person in house 2 must like blue.

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Since the person in house 1 is the pianist, the person in house 2 cannot own horses (otherwise, the root beer lover would have to be in house 1, which is not possible).

Thus, the person in house 1 must own horses. This means the person in house 2 cannot be the horse owner. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the root beer lover.

Given that the root beer lover is in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner (since the root beer lover and the horse owner are already accounted for).

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1. The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the lilies are in the second house, the tulips must be in the first house.

So, we have:

- House 2: Dog owner, Horses (since the horse owner is in the second house)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

- Clue 7: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, which is already satisfied.
- Clue 8: There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the vase of tulips must be in the third house.

- Clue 11: The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the red lover must be in the fourth house.
- Clue 12: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

1. The person with a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives directly left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person with a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet cannot be in the second house. Therefore, it must be in either house 1 or house 3.

**Case 1: Rose bouquet in house 1**
- From Clue 3, the person with a sedan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person with an SUV must be in house 2, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 3.
- From Clue 1, the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 2.

This arrangement would be:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Sedan (and vase of tulips)
- House 3: SUV (and bouquet of lilies)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues.

**Case 2: Rose bouquet in house 3**
- From Clue 3, the person with a sedan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person with an SUV must be in house 2, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

This arrangement would be:
- House 1: SUV (and bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Sedan (and vase of tulips)
- House 3: Rose bouquet

This arrangement also satisfies all the clues.

Since both scenarios are valid, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments. However, the question specifically asks for the house where the person who drives a truck lives. In both valid scenarios, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) 3"

6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
7. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
8. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house, so the SUV must be in the first house.
9. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other, so the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.
10. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.
11. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other, so the person who likes blue must be in the second house.
12. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, and the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. Given the constraints, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.
13. The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

Thus, the basketball player lives in house number 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1 and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

From Clue 2, we know the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff.

Now, using Clue 1:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses.
- Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and owns horses.

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Wearing sandals, owns horses, ate spaghetti.
- House 2: History book buff, owns no horses (since the person in house 1 owns horses).

Since the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, the person in house 2 must have eaten fried rice.

"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house and is also the fantasy book enthusiast, we can place the science fiction book fanatic in the first house because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 2).

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or house 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Given these clues, let's test the possible arrangements:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Loafers

2. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not boots

5. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

- Kiwis and milk must be adjacent, with kiwis in the left house (from clue 5), so:
  - House 2: Water, Phone
  - House 3: Kiwis, Milk
- Boots cannot be in House 3 (from clue 4), and boots must be to the right of the gameboy (from clue 6), so:
  - House 3: Kiwis, Milk, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3)

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist

- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Let's start placing the known items:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

From Clue 6, since the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: White

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Stew

"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we can deduce that the second house cannot be occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist simultaneously. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's place the violinist in the second house. According to clue 1, the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, as there is no house to the right of it. Therefore, the cricketer must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house and the violinist is already there, the basketball player must be in the third house. This leaves the soccer player in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

After water is treated with chlorine, it should be allowed to sit for a sufficient amount of time to allow the chlorine to dissipate to safe levels. If the water is not properly treated or if it has not been allowed to sit long enough, it may still contain harmful levels of chlorine, which can be toxic and cause health issues. Always follow local guidelines and water treatment procedures to ensure the water is safe for drinking."

"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the specific pigment, material, and application. For instance, certain rare pigments like lapis lazuli, used in ultramarine, have been historically very expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in certain applications. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."

"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are used to launch projectiles, they differ significantly in their design, range, and operational characteristics. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military applications, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, a slingshot is a small, handheld device that uses elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

In Somalia, the application of Sharia law varies widely across different regions and communities. A celibate cleric, unless accused of a specific crime such as adultery, would not likely face a stoning. The likelihood of such a punishment depends on the local legal and cultural context, and it is more common in areas where strict interpretations of Sharia law are enforced. Without specific accusations or a particular region in mind, it is reasonable to assume that a celibate cleric would not suffer such a penalty."
"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is a political entity in Sweden, which is a country in Scandinavia."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should be al dente, meaning it should have a slight firmness to it and not be overly soft or sticky.

"(A) No

While enjoying lunch on the beach can be a delightful experience, it is not an effective way to spot a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed when the sun is at a low angle (below 42 degrees) and the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point. This alignment is rare and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach. Therefore, it's not a good activity for spotting a full circle of a rainbow."

Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(B) No

White rice does not go rancid in the same way that sesame seeds do. Rancidity is a process that primarily affects foods containing fats and oils, such as sesame seeds.

"(B) No

Jon Brower Minnoch, the heaviest person ever recorded, had a maximum weight of 635 kg. The launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 815 kg. Since 635 kg is less than 815 kg, Jon Brower Minnoch would not be able to break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch."
