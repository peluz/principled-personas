- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The cricketer lives in the third house (next to the person who likes red).
- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fourth or fifth house (to the right of the cricketer).
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- The person who is eating oranges lives to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other, so the person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person wearing loafers is in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating oranges is in the third house.
- The person who is eating bananas is in the fourth house.
- The person who likes red is in the second house.
- The person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house."
The tea drinker lives in house number (A) 2.
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Based on the clues provided:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. This aligns with clue 1, confirming that the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. Clue 5 tells us that the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other (clue 7), and the person who had stew cannot be in the first house (clue 2), the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

"To solve the logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
7. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
8. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
9. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Next, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Now, let's use Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Next, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Now, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is (B) 1.

Answer: (D) 4"
"To solve the puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Using Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:
- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Using Clue 7 and Clue 10:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:
- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Using Clue 7 and Clue 10:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:
- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Using Clue 9:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 4 and the cricketer in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Using Clue 9:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Using Clue 12:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 3:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Starting with Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. This leaves us with the following houses for the other characteristics:

1. House 1
2. House 2
3. House 3
4. House 4

Next, let's use Clue 10. There are two houses between the romance book lover and the tennis player. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 12, there is one house between the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using Clue 13, there are two houses between the romance book lover and the mystery book reader. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
- The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
- The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: (B) 2"
"The person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

Answer: (E) 5"
The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\).
"The person who had pizza lives in House 2.

Answer: (A) 2"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From the clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"

Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist

From clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Likes white

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover cannot be in the first house (since the person who owns horses must be to the left of the root beer lover).

Since the person who likes white is in house 1, the person in house 2 cannot like white. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be the root beer lover.

Given that the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses, the person who owns horses must be in house 1. This leaves the dog owner to be in house 1 as well.

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 1. The correct answer is (A) 1."
"The percussionist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in House 2.

   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

From Clue 1, since the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house (because there is one house between them).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house (since the person with lilies is in the second house and must be to the right of the person with tulips).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only drink left is water, and the only flower left is a rose bouquet. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

- Clue 11: The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the fifth house, the red lover must be in the fourth house.
- Clue 12: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the red lover is in the fourth house, the blue lover must be in the fifth house, but the romance book lover is already in the fifth house, so the blue lover must be in the fourth house, and the mystery book reader must be in the third house.
- Clue 13: The person who owns horses lives in the second house, which is already satisfied.

Now, we have:

"To solve the puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

Answer: (D) 4"
"To solve the puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet cannot be in the second house. Therefore, it must be in either house 1 or house 3.

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- From Clue 2, if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2.
- If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

Next, let's place the sedan and tulips:

- From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. This means the rose bouquet must be in either house 1 or house 3, and the sedan must be in the adjacent house.

Let's test the scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

4. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
7. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
8. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house, so the SUV must be in the first house.
9. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other, so the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.
10. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.
11. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other, so the person who likes blue must be in the second house.
12. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house, and the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. Given the constraints, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.
13. The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew is in the first house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

(B) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals. This scenario is consistent with all clues.

- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff. But this would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals. This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Now, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 ate fried rice.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house and is also the fantasy book enthusiast, we can place the science fiction book fanatic in the first house because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 2).

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who has a computer.

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Loafers

2. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not boots

5. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not kiwis

- House 1: Loafers
- House 1: Not kiwis
- Grapes and water must be adjacent, with grapes in the left house, so:
  - House 1: Grapes, Loafers
  - House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- Kiwis and milk must be adjacent, with kiwis in the left house, so:
  - House 2: Water, Phone
  - House 3: Kiwis, Milk
- Boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy, so:
  - House 3: Kiwis, Milk, Computer (since boots must be to the right of the gameboy and cannot be in House 3)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular movements that are not under the person's control. Ballet competitions require precise, controlled movements and a high level of technical skill, which would be challenging for someone with these symptoms to achieve. Therefore, a person with St. Vitus's Dance would likely not win a ballet competition."
"(A) No

Pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use human languages like Pig Latin. They communicate through their own complex systems of sounds and body language."

The Olympiastadion Berlin, which hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics, had a seating capacity of around 100,000 spectators. In contrast, the typical Super Bowl crowd, including both stadium attendees and additional viewing areas, often exceeds 100,000 people. Therefore, the venue would be too small for a Super Bowl crowd."
"(A) No

Based on my knowledge of the marine life in the Caribbean, brown rock fish are not typically found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis. The local fish species are more commonly associated with the tropical waters of the region."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which might involve managing the environment to avoid bee activity. This could still involve some interaction with the plants and potentially with insects, which might be distressing for someone with entomophobia."
"(A) Yes

If Martin Luther wrote one thesis per day, he would run out of theses well before half a year. He wrote 95 theses in total, which would last him only 95 days. Therefore, he would indeed run out of theses in less than half a year."
"(A) No

Waltz and slam dance both have their own risks, but slam dance generally involves more vigorous and less controlled movements, which can make it more prone to injury. While waltz is a more structured and controlled dance, the potential for injury in any physical activity depends on factors like skill level and environment. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that waltz is less injurious than slam dance."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny, also known as the ""War Nickel,"" is not suitable for making silverware. While it contains a small amount of silver, the alloy also includes copper and manganese, which makes it inappropriate for use in silverware. Silverware requires pure or nearly pure silver to meet quality and hygiene standards. Using coins for such purposes is not only impractical but also illegal in many places due to the potential for counterfeiting and the value of the coins themselves."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to its harsh environmental conditions. The surface temperature is around 462°C (864°F), making it impossible for snow or any snowboarding equipment to exist. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's, which would make movement challenging and dangerous. The thick atmosphere and toxic clouds of sulfuric acid further complicate any attempt at snowboarding."
"(B) No

Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not involved in the Battle of Tours. The battle is more closely associated with Charles Martel, Pepin's father, who led the Frankish forces to victory against the Umayyad Muslims in 732 AD."

"(A) No

Jack Black and Bear McCreary operate in different creative fields. Jack Black is primarily known as an actor, comedian, and musician, while Bear McCreary is a composer.

"(A) No

Apollo, a figure from Greek mythology, is known for his divine powers and physical prowess, while D'Artagnan is a skilled human swordsman from a novel. Given Apollo's supernatural abilities, it would be challenging for any single D'Artagnan to defeat him, but the number of D'Artagnan figures involved could potentially change the outcome. However, without specifying the number of D'Artagnan figures, it's reasonable to assume that a single D'Artagnan would not be able to defeat Apollo."
"(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Melanoma, the type of skin cancer he developed, is often linked to sun exposure. Sunscreen helps protect the skin from harmful UV rays, which can reduce the risk of skin cancers."
"(B) No

The French Defense, which starts with 1.e4 e6, does not defend against a four-move checkmate. Fool's Mate, which occurs in a few moves at the beginning of the game, typically involves moves like 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5+. This is very different from the opening moves of the French Defense. Therefore, the French Defense cannot defend against a four-move checkmate."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is used to disinfect water, but it needs to be properly managed to ensure it is safe for consumption. After water is treated with chlorine, it should be allowed to sit for a sufficient amount of time to allow the chlorine to dissipate to safe levels. If the water is not properly treated or if it has not been allowed to sit long enough, it may still contain harmful levels of chlorine, which can be toxic and cause health issues. Always follow local guidelines and water treatment procedures to ensure the water is safe for drinking."
"(B) No

A dichromat would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color, as both gases are colorless. Dichromacy affects the ability to perceive red and green, but it does not provide the ability to see other colors that could help in distinguishing between these specific gases."

"(A) No

Sea turtles in the wild continue to face numerous challenges such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change, which are not alleviated by human quarantine measures. While sea turtles in captivity or protected areas might have better care and monitoring, the general population of sea turtles is still at risk. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine in the broader sense."
"(B) No

Jesus lived in a time and place very different from our modern era. The concept of the Easter Bunny, which originated in Germanic and later German-American traditions, would not have existed during his time. Therefore, Jesus would not understand the Easter Bunny."

Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not beneficial to one's health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, who was known to be a heavy drinker, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ethanol was beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the specific pigment, material, and application. For instance, some rare pigments like lapis lazuli, used historically to create ultramarine, have been very expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more expensive in certain applications. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, while an incredibly strong athlete, would not throw a Bengal fox with ease. The act of throwing a small animal like a fox is not within the scope of his athletic focus and would not be performed with the level of comfort and control implied by the question."

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are used to launch projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational requirements. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military contexts, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. Slingshots, on the other hand, are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden, which is located in Scandinavia."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should have a slight firmness to it, known as al dente, and should not be overly soft or sticky.

"(A) No

While having lunch on the beach can be a delightful experience, it's not the best way to spot a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky, and a full circle can only be seen when the sun is at a low angle (below 42 degrees) and you are positioned at the exact anti-solar point. This alignment is quite rare and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach."
