"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips is in House 1 (directly left of House 2, where the flutist lives).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies is in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist is in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green

2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis

3. **Clue 5 and Clue 8 combined:** The person who likes green and is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis

4. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must live in the second and third houses.
   - House 2: Blue, Gameboy
   - House 3: (Not Blue, Not Gameboy)

5. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in the third house.
   - House 3: Percussionist

6. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - Since the root beer lover must be in a house to the left of the person who is eating grapes, and the person who is eating grapes cannot be in the first house (occupied by green and kiwis), the person who is eating grapes must be in the second house.
   - House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 3:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover, and the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who has a television and the person who only drinks water must be in the first house.
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

8. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
   - The person who has a gameboy is in the second house, so the cellist must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Summarizing the placements:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Apples
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Mangos

From Clue 10, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

From Clue 12, the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3.

From Clue 11, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, so the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

From Clue 7, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker, so the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 or 2. Since the root beer lover lives in house 1, the person who drives a truck must be in house 2.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1 or 2. Since the root beer lover lives in house 1 and the person who drives a truck lives in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.

From Clue 8, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person who drives a convertible must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, so the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

Therefore, the tea drinker must live in house 2.

The correct answer is **(B) 2**."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5.

2. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza can live in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means if the root beer lover lives in house \(x\), the person who had stew lives in house \(x+1\).

4. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.**
   - This is a contradiction with clue 1, but we can assume the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese, which is house 5.

5. **The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means if the coffee drinker lives in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti lives in house \(x+1\).

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

7. **The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live in consecutive houses.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 2 and 4 are left to be filled with pizza, root beer, stew, and milk.

Since the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other, the only logical arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Coffee
- House 5: Grilled cheese (and water)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5."

- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the radio and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (they must be next to each other)

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations

- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Since there are two houses between the banana and cat lover, the banana must be in House 1 and the cat lover in House 4.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we need to place the fruits and pets.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover

- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 7, the apple is to the left of the cat lover, so the apple must be in House 1.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 12, the orange is to the left of the apple, so the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio

- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can conclude:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their book preference and sport.

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Starting with the golfer in the first house:
1. Golfer - House 1

Next, we use Clue 3:
- The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1, and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4. The only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
  - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Now, using Clue 1:
- The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1, and the swimmer cannot be in House 4. The only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
  - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Since the swimmer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 4), the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Finally, using Clue 2:
- The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as per Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person based on their favorite color, drink, and book preference. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct answer:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know that the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio. Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio (since the person in house 2 has a fish and likes yellow, as we will deduce).

Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
12. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
13. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
14. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.
16. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
17. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
18. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other, so the person who likes red must live in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes milk must live in the first house and the person who likes blue in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. Since the second house is already occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who owns horses must live in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the fish enthusiast, and there is one house between them. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the bird keeper must live in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the first and second houses are occupied, the root beer lover must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the third and fourth houses are occupied, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza must live in the fifth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first, third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the first, second, and third houses are occupied, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth or fifth house.
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the third house is occupied by the romance book lover, the person who likes yellow must live in the first or fifth house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the tea drinker must live in the fourth house, and the person who likes white must live in the fifth house.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the **4th house**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the cellist must be in the second and third houses, respectively.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by organizing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by listing the clues and the characteristics of the houses:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the cat lover in house 1:

- **House 1:** Cat lover

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio, and the first house must have the horses.

Therefore, the second house has:
- Horses
- Radio

The only remaining characteristic is high heels, which must belong to the person in the second house.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

6. **The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.**
7. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**

Given that the baseball player lives in the second house, we can start by placing that information:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Next, we know the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must live to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Finally, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. According to the given clues, this is directly stated in clue 11. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by summarizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, the only possible positions are:
- Pianist in house 2, high heels in house 3.
- Pianist in house 3, high heels in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Next, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5:
- The person in house 1 is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1 or house 3. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV cannot live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Next, let's use Clue 10:

- **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, let's use Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Next, let's use Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

Given this information, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The correct answer to the question ""What is the number of the house where the history book buff lives?"" is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct placement of each characteristic in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **House 1: Soccer player**
2. **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
3. **House 3: Kiwi eater**
4. **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

20. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
21. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**
22. **House 2: Not cello (clue 13)**

From the above, we can deduce that House 2 must be the person who ate grilled cheese (the only remaining option).

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Kiwi eater**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast and must be to the right of the swimmer, and House 5 cannot be apples, let's place the swimmer and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**
- **House 5: Not apples (clue 3)**

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- **House 5: Stew eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 1 is the person who ate fried rice.

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The remaining characteristics are:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: Grilled cheese eater**
- **House 3: Swimmer**
- **House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast**
- **House 5: Stew eater**

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- **House 2: Apples eater**

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in house 3 does not own a sedan.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in house 4 owns an SUV.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3, as the person who owns a sedan is in House 3.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - The basketball player cannot be in House 3 (since the cat lover is there), so the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the soccer player would be in House 2, and the truck driver would be in House 3, which satisfies Clue 1.

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by placing the known elements and then use the clues to deduce the rest.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 8**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. **Clue 10**: The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
6. **Clue 11**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 12**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
8. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
9. **Clue 14**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 15**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 16**: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
12. **Clue 17**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
13. **Clue 18**: The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
14. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

Starting with the radio in the fourth house, we can use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the vase of tulips and the rose bouquet. Since the vase of tulips is to the right of the rose bouquet, and the rose bouquet is directly left of the bouquet of daffodils, the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house (Clue 7). Therefore, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the rose bouquet would be in the second house, and the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Now, using Clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house, so the rose bouquet must be in the second house, and the vase of tulips in the third house.

Next, using Clue 11, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the bouquet of daffodils, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first house.

Using Clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house.

Using Clue 17, the pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the pianist must be in the first house, but the fish enthusiast is already there, so this is consistent.

Using Clue 15, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the percussionist must be in the first house, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Using Clue 18, the percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the percussionist is in the first house, the cat lover must be in the second house, but the person who owns an SUV is already there, so this is consistent.

Using Clue 13, the guitarist lives to the left of the person who owns horses. Since the guitarist must be in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.

Using Clue 12, the bird keeper lives to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the bird keeper must be in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house, but the person who owns an SUV is already there, so this is consistent.

Using Clue 9, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, but the fish enthusiast is already there, so this is consistent.

Using Clue 10, the person who has a television does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the person who has a television must be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the first house is occupied by the fish enthusiast, the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a radio, the person who has a television must be in the fifth house.

Therefore, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

7. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
8. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the first house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy

However, House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so the person eating apples must live in House 1.

Using Clue 3:
5. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in House 1, the person wearing running shoes must live in House 2. But House 2 is already occupied by the history book buff, so this must be re-evaluated.

- If the person who owns horses is in House 3, the person with a television must be in House 4.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the possible arrangements based on the clues:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From these deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their sport and lunch choice. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs for fried rice and spaghetti are (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 3).

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3).

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

Given Clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we can deduce the following:
- The person who likes white lives in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- The baseball player lives in house 1.
- The person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We need to determine the house number of the root beer lover.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker must live in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot live in the first house.

3. **Clue 3 and Clue 2 (revisited):** If the root beer lover lives in the third house, the water drinker must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."

4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in either the first or the third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person with horses must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Horses, Coffee drinker, and Rose bouquet**

"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader. Since the tennis player cannot live in the first house (clue 2), the tennis player must live in the second house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

   - The person who likes green must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - The pianist must be in House 3, 4, or 5 (but House 5 is not possible as there are only 4 houses).
   - The only possible positions are:
     - House 1: Green
     - House 3: Pianist

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
   - This confirms the previous clue.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Starting with the cellist in House 1, let's use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Using clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white must live in the second and third houses, respectively.

Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer must live in the third house.

Clue 5 indicates that the soccer player lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must also be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

Clue 2 states that the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

Clue 4 tells us that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5.

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the correct houses based on the provided clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 13**: The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Pizza

2. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish

   - House 2: Swimmer

5. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 5 has pizza, House 4 must have grilled cheese.
   - House 4: Grilled cheese

6. **Clue 2**: The cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Cat lover

7. **Clue 12**: The swimmer lives in the second house.
   - This is already placed, so no change.

8. **Clue 5**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
   - The cricketer must be in House 1 or 2, and the tennis player must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 4**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - The basketball player must be in House 4 or 5, and the tennis player must be in House 3 or 2.

10. **Clue 7**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
    - The cricketer must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

    - The person eating oranges must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating mangos must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

12. **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

- House 5: Pizza, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Given the constraints, the only remaining options for House 1 are:
- House 1: Fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the correct answer:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in House 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1, as it is to the left of the mystery book reader.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct house for the person who likes blue.

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must live in the first house. Therefore, the white person must live in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Starting with Clue 6, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. This gives us:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Likes blue
- House 3: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 already has someone who likes blue, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 1. Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

Now we have:

- House 1: Eating grapes, ?
- House 2: Likes blue
- House 3: Wearing loafers, ?

Using Clue 3, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who is eating grapes is in House 1, the basketball player must be in House 1. This means the person who is eating oranges must be in House 2 (since the person who is eating grapes is in House 1 and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in House 3).

Now we have:

- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, ?
- House 2: Likes blue, eating grapes, ?
- House 3: Wearing loafers, ?

Using Clue 1, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 3. This means the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2 (since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3).

Now we have:

- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, ?
- House 2: Likes blue, eating grapes, wearing sandals
- House 3: Wearing loafers, cricketer

Using Clue 2, the baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the cat lover cannot be in House 1 (basketball player) or House 2 (baseball player or cat lover), the cat lover must be in House 3. This means the baseball player must be in House 1.

Now we have:

- House 1: Baseball player, eating oranges, ?
- House 2: Likes blue, eating grapes, wearing sandals
- House 3: Wearing loafers, cricketer, cat lover

Using Clue 4, the dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green cannot be in House 1 (baseball player) or House 2 (cat lover), the person who likes green must be in House 3. This means the dog owner must be in House 1.

Now we have:

- House 1: Dog owner, eating oranges, likes green
- House 2: Likes blue, eating grapes, wearing sandals
- House 3: Wearing loafers, cricketer, cat lover

The only remaining characteristic for each person is their shoe type. The person who is wearing loafers must be the cat lover, the person who is wearing sandals must be the dog owner, and the person who is wearing boots must be the baseball player.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 3.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

5. **There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the pianist are 2 houses apart.

6. **There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**

    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

From clue 16, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who likes milk is in house 3. From clue 8, the guitarist is in house 3, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker is in house 5, and the tennis player is in house 4.

From clue 15, the fish enthusiast is in house 5, and the swimmer is in house 3.

From clue 6, the pianist is in house 3, and the bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 4, the flutist is in house 5, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice is in house 3, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 18, the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

4. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 3, House 4, or House 1 (but House 1 is already taken by the minivan).

5. **The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.**
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.**
   - The computer cannot be in House 1.

Let's place the information we have:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone must be in House 2, and the person with the SUV must be in House 4.

- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

From clue 4, the radio must be in House 4 (since it must be to the right of the gameboy in House 3).

- House 4: SUV and Radio

From clue 5, the convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 2 or House 1. But House 1 is already taken by the minivan, so the convertible must be in House 2.

- House 2: Phone and Convertible

From clue 6, the computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

- House 3: Gameboy and Computer

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information step by step. Here are the clues and the process to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 3:** Vase of tulips (Clue 3)
- **House 2:** Computer (Clue 6)

From Clue 2, the person with the phone must be in House 1, and the person with the television must be in House 2. However, House 2 is already occupied by the computer, so this is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions of the phone and television.

Since the person with the phone must be directly left of the person with the television, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, the only possible positions for the phone and television are House 1 and House 3, respectively. This means:

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 3:** Television

Now, let's use Clue 1: The person with the bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone. Since the person with the phone is in House 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is occupied by the computer, and House 3 is occupied by the television. Therefore, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio. Since the person with the radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (because the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), the person with the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 is occupied by the phone, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, so the person with the radio must be in House 3. This means:

- **House 3:** Radio

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in House 4, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

Now, we have:

- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 2:** Computer
- **House 3:** Radio, Television
- **House 4:** Bouquet of lilies
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

From Clue 7, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 1 (phone), House 2 (computer), or House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), the only possible positions are House 3 and House 4. But House 3 is occupied by the radio and television, so the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 4, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 5. This means:

- **House 4:** Rose bouquet
- **House 5:** Carnations arrangement

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer (Clue 1) and Fish enthusiast (Clue 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a computer).

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics based on the provided clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water, and the person who likes milk cannot be in House 4, we can deduce:
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. Given the remaining options, the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"

5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the correct houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1, the person with lilies must be the golfer. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the soccer player in house 3 has daffodils, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the person with tulips must be the basketball player in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
4. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 4).

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

6. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 6**: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
10. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's start placing the remaining characteristics:
- Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

7. **Person who ate grilled cheese is not in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Combining Clues:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese).
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

### Arranging the Remaining Information:

- The person who ate stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

### Conclusion:

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Since the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer, and the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person is a science fiction book fanatic and the other is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we can deduce that the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice must live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot live in house 2, as the root beer lover would then have to live in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can summarize the following:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Not a root beer lover, not a horse owner, not white color lover

Since the root beer lover must be to the right of the horse owner and the horse owner cannot be in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 1. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the dog owner cannot be in house 2 (as the root beer lover is there), the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Stew

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Fried Rice
  - House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 3, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

From clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, we know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

From clue 3 again, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Summarizing the possible positions:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

From clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Apple eater
- House 3: Apple eater (but this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Since the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since the coffee drinker is not in house 2 and must be left of the milk drinker).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (from Clue 7), and the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3), the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

The person who likes red must be in House 3 (since the person who likes red is next to the person who is wearing loafers, and the only remaining house is House 3).

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Water drinker

2. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2, with the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)

3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. But since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house. This means the history book buff, who is in the third house, ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the green lover must be in the first or second house. But the yellow lover is in the first house, so the green lover must be in the second house.

- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).

    - Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

12. **There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.**

- Swimmer: House 3
- Violinist: House 2
- Cricketer: House 4
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 6, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in consecutive houses. Since the cricketer is in House 4, the basketball player and the guitarist must be in Houses 3 and 4, but the swimmer is already in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 3 and the guitarist in House 4.

- Basketball player: House 3
- Guitarist: House 4

From Clue 2, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in a house to the right of the guitarist, so it must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in House 5, and the guitarist must be in House 4, which is consistent.

From Clue 3, the person with sandals is directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the person with sandals must be in House 2, and the person with a vase of tulips in House 3.

- Sandals: House 2
- Vase of tulips: House 3

From Clue 4, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

- Running shoes: House 1
- Bouquet of daffodils: House 5

From Clue 7, the person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the person with high heels. Since the person with high heels cannot be in House 5 (bouquet of daffodils), and the person with sandals is in House 2, the person with high heels must be in House 1, and the person with a bouquet of lilies in House 3.

- High heels: House 1
- Bouquet of lilies: House 3

From Clue 8, the person with loafers is directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (high heels) or House 2 (sandals), the percussionist must be in House 5, and the person with loafers in House 4.

- Loafers: House 4
- Percussionist: House 5

From Clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other. Since the basketball player is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4, the baseball player must be in House 2.

- Baseball player: House 2

Finally, the flutist must be in House 1.

- Flutist: House 1

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2.

- From Clue 2, the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 1 (as each person has a different pet, and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clues 2, 4, and 6, we can conclude that the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. **Clue 9**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. **Clue 14**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
   - This aligns with the previous clue, confirming the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who has a radio does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 13**: The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 15**: The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Since the running shoes are in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

10. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
13. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
14. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
15. **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person who is wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house, which is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.

From Clue 12, the person who has a radio does not live in the second house, so the person who has a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater, yellow lover, and tea drinker are in consecutive houses. The sequence must be: pizza, yellow, tea.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater. The sequence must be: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the positions of the people based on the given information.

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other (Clue 6), and the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Next, using Clue 4:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

Now, using Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
- The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, so this clue is satisfied.

Using Clue 2:
- There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
- The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

Finally, using Clue 1:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Violinist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

We need to assign the remaining devices (radio and gameboy) to the remaining houses (House 1 and House 3). We also need to ensure that the person with the phone is not in House 2.

Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the only remaining devices are:
- Radio
- Gameboy

From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 1 with the Radio.

- House 1: Boots, Radio

Now, the only device left is the Gameboy, which must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the only house left for the person wearing loafers is the first house.

Now, let's assign the drinks based on the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the person in the first house cannot be the milk drinker. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person with the lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the saxophonist cannot live in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From the above deductions, we can conclude:

   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, people, their musical instruments, flowers, drinks, and favorite books. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 14**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we can place them in the remaining houses.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Using Clue 8, we place the person who only drinks water:

- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 5, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - From clue 1, the person who likes green is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3 (where the fantasy book enthusiast would be to the right), so the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3.

4. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - The rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
   - Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in House 1 or House 3.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - Since the rose bouquet is in House 2, the horses and blue must be in House 1 and House 3.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - The percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

7. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - The sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Tulips (since it's next to the bird keeper and not yellow or rose)
- House 3: Yellow

From Clue 6, the horses and blue must be in House 1 and House 3. Since the rose bouquet is in House 2, the bird keeper must be in House 2.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we can deduce that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist.

From clue 3, since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes red must be in house 2.

Since the person in house 1 is already identified as a fantasy book reader and likes green, the person in house 2 must be a mystery book reader and likes red.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer is in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. Given that the golfer is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2. Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

We need to determine the house number where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Let's break it down step by step:

- From Clue 1, if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses. Conversely, if the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 owns horses.
- From Clue 2, the history book buff must live to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2, as the history book buff must be in house 2 or house 1 to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Given these clues, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti:
   - The person in house 2 would be the history book buff.
   - The person in house 2 would own horses.
   - The person in house 1 would be wearing sandals.

2. If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti:
   - The person in house 1 would be the history book buff.
   - The person in house 1 would own horses.
   - The person in house 2 would be wearing sandals.

Since the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2, the only consistent scenario is:

- The person in house 1 ate spaghetti.
- The person in house 2 ate fried rice.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.
- From Clue 2, since the flutist does not live in the first house, the flutist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

- There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Using **Clue 4**:

- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast

4. Carnations

Using **Clue 5**:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Using **Clue 7**:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using **Clue 9**:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct house and food/colored combination for each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in House 4 (from Clue 3 and Clue 2), the person who likes red must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the information:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

We need to place the remaining items and colors. Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the other items, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively. Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."

4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

From clue 2, the percussionist is in the second house. Therefore, the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 3, the violinist must live to the right of the basketball player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the violinist is the first house.

From clue 5, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Given that the percussionist is in the second house and the violinist is in the first house, the only remaining house for the basketball player is the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3.
- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we have a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist are in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Hence, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

From the clues, we can start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

   - Clue 4: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - Clue 13: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, the cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they are in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the pianist and the kiwi-eater must be in adjacent houses, and the violinist and the kiwi-eater must be two houses apart. The only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be to the right of the violinist, so the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, the first house cannot be the home of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

Thus, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we can deduce that the root beer lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know that the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must live in the first house and the cellist must live in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Carnations

2. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
   - House 4: Boots

3. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips
   - House 5: Loafers

4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - House 1: Sandals

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - House 2: Running Shoes
   - House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - House 2: Daffodils

7. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips
   - House 5: Loafers

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes

From the above deductions, we have:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

9. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white, and the swimmer is to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the person who likes white in the middle.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which contradicts the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house (House 1), the coffee drinker must be in the first house as well because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- This means the person in the second house (House 2) must be wearing sandals.

Since the coffee drinker is in House 1 and the science fiction book fanatic is also in House 1, the romance book lover must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we can deduce that the percussionist must live in house 1, and the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Therefore, the person who has the phone lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

From clue 3, the only possible positions are:
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.

Since the second house already has the convertible (clue 1), the person who owns a sedan cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who drives a convertible
- House 3: Person who likes white

The only car left for the person in house 1 is the minivan, and the only car left for the person in house 3 is the sedan. Therefore, the person in house 1 likes yellow and drives a minivan.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) 3**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house and the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

This leaves the third house for the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house and the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people in the houses, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water (because the person in house 2 cannot be drinking water as per clue 1).

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals as per clue 2).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels (House 1) is to the left of the person wearing sandals (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in the left house (House 1) if the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

Thus, we can assign the characteristics as follows:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

The only fruit left is kiwis, so the person in House 1 (who is wearing high heels and is a tea drinker) must be eating kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement of the houses, people, and their favorite drinks and musical instruments.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Given these clues, let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the possible positions for the violinist and the guitarist:

- If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house number where the person who only drinks water lives.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

- House 2: Radio

From Clue 1, we know:
- The gameboy and the computer must be in adjacent houses. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. Since House 1 has the gameboy, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3 (Grilled cheese) or House 5 (Spaghetti). But House 3 is already occupied by grilled cheese, so:
- House 5: Fried rice

This leaves:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who has a television must be to the left of the person who has a phone. The only remaining houses are House 1 and House 2. Since House 1 has the gameboy, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Phone

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

- House 5: Golfer

The number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \boxed{4}."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the bird keeper cannot live in house 1. Given Clue 1, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

With the bird keeper in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (since they live to the right of the bird keeper).

Thus, the pizza eater must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. From Clue 2, the bird keeper lives in the third house.
2. Clue 1 states that the cat lover does not live in the second house.
3. Clue 3 indicates that the golfer lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. Clue 4 tells us that the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. Clue 5 states that the baseball player does not live in the third house.
6. Clue 6 confirms that the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
7. Clue 7 indicates that the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player.
8. Clue 8 states that the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper.
9. Clue 9 indicates that the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The bird keeper is in the third house (Clue 2).
- The soccer player must be in the first or second house (Clue 8).
- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player (Clue 9), so they must be in the first or second house.
- The person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house (Clues 4 and 6), so they must be in the second or fourth house.
- The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player (Clue 7), so they must be in the third or fourth house.

Considering all these constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 10, we know:
- **House 1: Cat lover**

Using Clue 5, Clue 8, and Clue 9, we can deduce:
- The fish enthusiast must be in House 2 or 3.
- The person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- The flutist must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person in House 2 must be the one wearing running shoes and eating oranges. Therefore, the person in House 3 must be the flutist and the fish enthusiast.

Using Clue 6, we know:
- The flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast, which is consistent with the arrangement.

Using Clue 2, Clue 3, Clue 4, and Clue 9, we can deduce:
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the flutist is in House 3 and the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person wearing loafers cannot be in House 2, so they must be in House 1 or 3.

Given the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 3 is the flutist, and the only person who can be in House 2 is the one wearing running shoes and eating oranges.

Now, we can assign the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Cat lover (history book buff, eating bananas, wearing high heels)
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes (percussionist, eating oranges, fish enthusiast)
- House 3: Flutist (fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, cat lover)

The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions of the people, their favorite fruits, and their favorite colors.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Grapes

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

From Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can infer that the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 2 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: White
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

Now, we need to assign the fruits and colors:
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes yellow is in house 4).
- The person who likes yellow must be in house 4 (already assigned).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From Clue 1, the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in house 1 and the cat lover in house 2.

Since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other (Clue 3), and the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's analyze the given clues step by step to determine the correct arrangement:

1. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.

2. **The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has the water drinker.

3. **The root beer lover lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the root beer drinker.

4. **The person who has a television does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the television is in either the first or third house.

5. **The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips cannot be in the third house, and the television must be in the third house.

From clue 4 and 5, we can deduce:
- The television is in the third house.
- The vase of tulips must be in the first or second house.

Since the root beer drinker is in the first house (clue 3), the vase of tulips cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses. Given that the first house has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

16. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
17. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 3: Romance book lover.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover is in House 3. From Clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

Now, let's use Clue 16 and Clue 15:

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. The SUV owner must be in House 1 (since the sedan is in House 1 and the SUV cannot be in House 2 or 3).

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is the sedan, so the person who likes white must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the history book buff does not live in the fifth house. Since the mystery book reader is in House 5, the history book buff must be in House 1, 2, or 4. But House 1 is the sedan and House 2 is grapes, so the history book buff must be in House 4.

From Clue 17, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 and the person who is eating apples must be in House 4.

From Clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is grilled cheese, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."

- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 1: Not Green, Not Radio
- House 2: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 4: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 5: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy

From Clue 7, the green person is in House 3, and the radio is in House 3. From Clue 10, the radio is in House 3, so the green person is in House 3.

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the white person. From Clue 1, the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the percussionist in House 1 and the white person in House 2:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Radio, Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 4. This is consistent with the yellow person in House 4.

- House 4: Yellow, Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 4, the television must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the green person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try the percussionist in House 2 and the white person in House 3:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2:** The dog owner cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the dog owner must live in either house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3:** The person with the vase of tulips must live to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3 (since there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** The person with the carnations arrangement must live to the right of the bird keeper. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. The bird keeper must be in either house 2 or house 3.

4. **Combining Clues:**
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, which is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

    - House 2: Eating banana

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, we know:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Eating banana

From Clue 10, the person with loafers cannot be in House 3, so:
- House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

From Clue 1, the person with high heels must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3. Therefore, the person with high heels cannot be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the person with a gameboy must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with a basketball player must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 7, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with sandals must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person with oranges must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with a computer must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 9, the person with lilies cannot be in House 3.

From Clue 5, the person with loafers cannot be in House 2.

- House 4: Swimmer

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangos

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information and use the clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Mangos
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (Clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (Clue 3), so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first or second house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the horse owner must be in the first or second house. Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. The only house left for the romance book lover is the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

From clue 3 and clue 4, the person who is eating mangos cannot live in the first or third house, so they must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person who is eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with our current arrangement.

From clue 6, the person who is eating kiwis cannot live in the third house, so they must live in the first or fourth house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who is eating apples, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house. This conflicts with our previous deduction that the fourth house is occupied by the person who is eating mangos. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Given the constraints, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, we can systematically deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, people, and their characteristics. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red (clue 1), the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, which means there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the clues.

Given clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, which is already confirmed.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{D}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement.

   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Soccer player
   - House 3: ?

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
   - House 3: ?

3. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: Mystery book reader

4. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
   - Since the history book buff is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 3 already has the mystery book reader, so the person who had stew must be in House 1.

   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: Mystery book reader

5. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - Since the person who had stew is in House 1, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 3.

   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: High heels, Mystery book reader

6. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: High heels, Mystery book reader, Golfer

7. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
   - Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the stew, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Daffodils, Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: High heels, Mystery book reader, Golfer

8. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew is in House 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 already has the daffodils, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Daffodils, Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
   - House 3: High heels, Mystery book reader, Golfer, Running shoes

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Daffodils, Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: High heels, Mystery book reader, Golfer, Running shoes

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From Clue 5, we know the minivan must be to the right of the truck. From Clue 2, the truck and gameboy must be adjacent. From Clue 6, the flutist must be directly left of the minivan. Let's start by placing the truck, gameboy, and minivan:

- If the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2, and the minivan must be in house 3 (since the minivan is to the right of the truck and the flutist must be in house 1).

Now, let's place the cellist and the high heels and television:

- From Clue 3, the minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the high heels and television are adjacent, and the boots must be to the right of the percussionist. Since the cellist is in house 2, the high heels and television must be in houses 2 and 3, but the minivan is in house 3, so the television must be in house 2 and the high heels in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Cellist (with a television)
- House 3: Percussionist (with high heels and a minivan)

The remaining characteristics are:
- Flutist: Phone
- Cellist: Television
- Percussionist: Gameboy

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (Clue 5).
2. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (Clue 4).
3. The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other (Clue 3).
4. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Clue 8).
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist (Clue 10).
6. The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other (Clue 9).
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist (Clue 12).
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television (Clue 13).

From Clue 6 and Clue 7, we can place the violinist and the person eating oranges in houses 3 and 4, respectively, because they are next to each other and the person eating oranges is to the left of the saxophonist. Since the person eating apples lives in the fourth house (Clue 9 and 11), the correct answer is:

(A) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Now, we know:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's break it down:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew lives in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who drives a minivan (house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 3).

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- Since the person who has a rose bouquet (house 1) likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes red does not live in the first house, so they must live in house 2 or 3.
- Since the person who ate spaghetti (house 2) likes red, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given these clues, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly tells us that the bird keeper is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns horses is in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

11. **Clue 11:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
    - The root beer lover is not in house 3.

12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives.

From Clue 2, the tea drinker is in house 1. From Clue 5, the bouquet of lilies is in house 2. From Clue 4, the vase of tulips is in house 5. From Clue 8, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Grilled cheese

From Clue 6, the person who ate fried rice and the person who only drinks water are two houses apart. Considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Water

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, which is already placed in house 3, so:
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Water

From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 10, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 11, the root beer lover is not in house 3, so:
- House 3: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Yellow (already placed)
- House 5: Red (already placed)

From Clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are two houses apart, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

From Clue 13, the person who likes red and the person who likes green are next to each other, and considering the other placements, we can place:
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red
- House 2: Green

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of people, their cars, flowers, sports, lunch, and pets. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 12 and 13**:
   - The first house has a vase of tulips and someone who ate spaghetti.

2. **Clue 14**:
   - The rose bouquet is not in the second house.

3. **Clue 15**:
   - The soccer player lives to the right of the baseball player. This means the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the first house is occupied by someone who has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti, the baseball player and tennis player cannot be in houses 1 and 2. Thus, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 7**:
   - The bouquet of lilies is to the right of the soccer player. This means the soccer player cannot be in house 4, and the lilies owner cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 8**:
   - The minivan and convertible are next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

6. **Clue 9**:
   - The fried rice eater is to the right of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot be in house 4, and the fried rice eater cannot be in house 1.

7. **Clue 10**:
   - The rose bouquet is to the right of the sedan. This means the sedan cannot be in house 4, and the rose bouquet cannot be in house 1.

   - The minivan is not in the third house. This means the minivan must be in houses 1 or 2.

10. **Clue 4**:
    - The bird keeper is to the left of the cat lover. This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 4, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

11. **Clue 5**:
    - The fish enthusiast is to the left of the stew eater. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 4, and the stew eater cannot be in house 1.

Given these constraints, let's start placing the known elements:

- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti
- House 2: (Baseball player, Tennis player, Minivan/Convertible)
- House 3: (Sedan/Truck, Lilies)
- House 4: (Soccer player, Cat lover, Stew, Truck/Minivan)

From Clue 6, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is to the left of the tennis player, the baseball player is in house 2 and the tennis player is in house 3.

From Clue 8, the minivan and convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From Clue 3, the sedan must be in house 3, and the truck in house 4.

From Clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 9, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 10, the rose bouquet must be in house 4.

From Clue 11, the stew eater must be in house 4.

From Clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2, so it must be in house 4.

   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.
   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 1, the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
   - If the person who drives a truck is in house 1, the person who is eating grapes is in house 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots is in house 2.

### Combining the Clues:

- If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then:
  - The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
  - The person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
  - The person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
  - The mystery book reader is in house 2.

This combination satisfies all the clues:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.
- House 2: Person who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader.

### Remaining Characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots) must be the one who drives a convertible (since the other person drives a truck).
- The person in house 2 (who drives a truck and is a mystery book reader) must like red, eat oranges, and wear running shoes.

The fantasy book enthusiast must be the person in house 1, as the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct placements.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the second house cannot be occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist simultaneously. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the clues are referring to different people.

Given that the violinist lives in the second house, the basketball player must be in either the first or third house. Let's place the cricketer in the first house. Since the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer, the cellist must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

This leaves the basketball player to be in the first or third house. Since the cricketer is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house. This leaves the soccer player in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4. This is consistent with the previous clues.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue step by step. Let's start by placing the known information and then deduce the rest.

1. **The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.**
2. **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
3. **The flutist lives in the fourth house.**
4. **The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.**
5. **The guitarist does not live in the third house.**
6. **The violinist does not live in the third house.**
7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.**
8. **The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.**
9. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
10. **The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.**
11. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist lives in the second house (house 2), and the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist must be next to each other, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house (house 1).

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the people, fruits, cars, and flowers in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the root beer lover step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct house number for each person based on their sport, favorite color, and flowers in the foyer. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the violinist lives in the first house (House 1), the person in House 2 must be the bird keeper.
- The person with the computer lives in House 1 (to the left of the bird keeper, who is in House 2).

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From clue 10, **Pizza in House 4**. This is already known.

From clue 9, **Science Fiction not in House 5**. Since Science Fiction is in House 3, this is already known.

From clue 1, **Boots in House 2**. This is already known.

From clue 3, **Carnations live left of Running Shoes**. Since Carnations are in House 2, Running Shoes must be in House 3.

"Let's solve the logic puzzle step by step using the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV (because the SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots).

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only person left is the one in House 3, who must be wearing running shoes.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1:
- The history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4:
- The mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3:
- The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1, but we already have a phone in house 1. Therefore, the only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular, and often jerky movements. These symptoms would make it extremely challenging for a person to perform the precise and controlled movements required in a ballet competition. Therefore, a person with St. Vitus's Dance is unlikely to win a ballet competition."
"(A) No

Pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use human languages, including Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a language game designed for humans, where words are altered by moving the initial consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and adding ""ay."" Since pigs cannot comprehend or produce human language, it is impossible for them to use Pig Latin."

Ringo Starr, as a fan of various cuisines, would likely not avoid pot roast at a restaurant unless he had a specific dietary restriction or personal preference against it. Given his love for food and his diverse taste in cuisine, it’s reasonable to assume he would be open to trying pot roast if it was offered."
"(A) No

The Olympiastadion Berlin, which hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics, had a seating capacity of approximately 100,000 spectators. While this capacity is significant, it is generally not sufficient to accommodate the large crowds that typically attend a Super Bowl. The Super Bowl often draws audiences in the millions, both in the stadium and through television viewership. Therefore, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would not be large enough for a Super Bowl crowd."
"(A) No

Based on my expertise in marine biology and fish distribution, brown rock fish are not typically found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis. These fish are more commonly associated with rocky coastal areas in the Atlantic and Pacific, and the marine ecosystems around Saint Kitts and Nevis are characterized by different species adapted to the Caribbean environment."
"(B) No

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which can involve managing the environment to avoid bee activity. This might include removing male flowers or using protective covers, both of which could be distressing for someone with a fear of insects. Therefore, it might not be the best choice for a gardener with entomophobia."
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to calculate the number of days in half a year. Half a year is approximately 182.5 days. Martin Luther wrote 95 theses in total. If he wrote one thesis per day, he would run out of theses after 95 days. Since 95 days is less than 182.5 days, he would indeed run out of theses before half a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No

Waltz and slam dance have different physical demands and risks. Waltz is a more structured and controlled dance style, typically involving smooth, flowing movements, which generally carry a lower risk of injury. In contrast, slam dance involves more vigorous and sometimes uncontrolled movements, which can increase the risk of injury. Therefore, waltz is not necessarily less injurious than slam dance."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny, made primarily of an alloy containing 35% silver, 56% copper, and 9% manganese, is not suitable for making silverware. Silverware requires a high purity of silver to meet quality and hygiene standards, and the presence of copper and manganese in the penny would make it unsuitable for such use. Additionally, using coins for this purpose is illegal and not practical due to the value of the coins themselves."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to the planet's harsh environmental conditions. The surface temperature is approximately 462°C (864°F), making it impossible for any snowboarding equipment or human to survive. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's, which would create significant challenges for movement and equipment functionality. The atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, further complicating any attempt at snowboarding."
"(B) No

Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was not involved in the Battle of Tours. The battle is more directly associated with Charles Martel, Pepin's father, who led the Frankish forces to a significant victory against the Umayyad Muslims in 732 AD."

""Rick and Morty"" contains complex and sometimes dark themes that could be triggering for individuals, including children of alcoholics. The show's content, which includes mature humor, complex moral scenarios, and occasionally disturbing elements, might resonate with or trigger sensitive experiences for those who have had trauma related to substance abuse. Parents and guardians should be cautious and consider the potential impact on children who may be more vulnerable due to their personal or family history."

Simon Cowell is not eligible to vote for the next Supreme Court judge. The process for appointing Supreme Court justices involves the President nominating a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. Only U.S. citizens who meet specific constitutional and statutory requirements can serve as Supreme Court justices. Simon Cowell, while a U.S. citizen, does not meet these qualifications and thus cannot participate in the nomination or confirmation process."
"(A) No

Jack Dempsey, an iconic boxer from the early 20th century, lived and fought well before Conor McGregor's time. Dempsey's last professional fight was in 1927, whereas McGregor's career began in 2008. Therefore, it is not possible for Jack Dempsey to have witnessed any of Conor McGregor's fights."

Euphoria is often a key psychological effect associated with drug addiction. Many substances of abuse, such as opioids, stimulants, and others, can induce intense feelings of pleasure and well-being. This rewarding effect plays a significant role in the initial use and continued abuse of these drugs, contributing to the development of addiction. However, addiction involves a complex interplay of various factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental influences."
"(A) No

When comparing Apollo from Greek mythology and D'Artagnan from ""The Three Musketeers,"" it's important to consider the nature of their abilities and the contexts in which they operate. Apollo is a god with divine powers, including superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to manipulate natural elements. These abilities would give him a significant advantage in a physical confrontation.

D'Artagnan, on the other hand, is a skilled human swordsman known for his bravery and prowess with a sword. While he is highly skilled, his abilities are limited to human capabilities and do not include divine powers. Therefore, in a hypothetical scenario where Apollo and D'Artagnan were to face each other, Apollo's divine powers would likely give him the upper hand.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that a single Apollo would not be defeated by a single D'Artagnan. Thus, the answer is (A) No."

The French Defense, characterized by the moves 1.e4 e6, does not defend against a four-move checkmate. Fool's Mate, which occurs in a few moves at the start of the game, is a different scenario altogether. The French Defense is designed to establish a solid position and control the center, rather than preventing such a rapid checkmate."
"(B) No

Week-old chlorine water is not guaranteed to be safe for drinking. Chlorine is used in water treatment to disinfect and kill harmful microorganisms, but it must be properly managed to ensure it is safe for consumption. If the water has not been allowed to off-gas and decay properly, it may still contain harmful levels of chlorine, which can be toxic and pose health risks. It's important to follow proper water treatment procedures and guidelines to ensure the water is safe. If you are unsure, contact your local water treatment facility or health authority for guidance."
"(B) No

A dichromat, or someone with color vision deficiency, would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color alone, as both gases are colorless. Dichromats can have difficulty distinguishing red and green, but this does not affect their ability to recognize colorless gases. Therefore, a dichromat would not be able to easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas."
"(A) Yes

Elizabeth I ruled from 1558 to 1603, and ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was likely written by Christopher Marlowe and first performed around 1587. Given this timeframe, it is plausible that Elizabeth I could have seen the play during her reign. However, there is no definitive evidence to confirm that she did see it."
"(B) No

Sea turtles in the wild continue to face numerous challenges such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change, which are not alleviated by human quarantine measures. While sea turtles in captivity or protected areas might have a more stable environment, the broader context of their natural habitats remains challenging. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine in the same way humans might."
"The answer is (B) No.

Jesus, as a figure from the first century, would not have been familiar with the Easter Bunny, which is a modern tradition that emerged much later. Given the significant time gap and the different cultural contexts, it is unlikely that Jesus would understand the concept of the Easter Bunny."

Robert Wadlow, the tallest person ever recorded, stood at 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72 meters), which is significantly taller than the average height of a German Shepherd, which ranges from 22.5 to 28 inches (57 to 66 to 71 cm) at the shoulder. Therefore, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, the primary type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not considered beneficial to health, especially in excessive amounts. For individuals like Jack Kerouac, who were known to consume alcohol heavily, it often had detrimental effects on their health. Kerouac suffered from various health issues, including liver problems, which were partly due to his alcohol consumption. Therefore, ethanol was not beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary significantly depending on the material, process, and application. For instance, certain pigments like lapis lazuli, used to create ultramarine, have been historically very expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more costly in specific applications. Therefore, the claim that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(A) No

Ryan Crouser, while an extremely strong athlete, would not throw a Bengal fox with ease. The physical capabilities required for his shot put events are different from the act of throwing a small animal. A Bengal fox typically weighs between 4.4 to 11 pounds (2 to 5 kg), and while Crouser has the strength to lift and throw objects of similar weight, the context and safety of throwing a live animal make it impractical and not something he would do with ease."
"(B) Yes

Under the rules Voldemort would have imposed, students at Hogwarts would not be allowed to have dark marks. Therefore, Voldemort himself would have been barred from the school due to his possession of such a mark."
"(A) No

Both The Jackson 5 and The Isley Brothers were family bands, but The Isley Brothers originally consisted of five members (O'Kelly Isley, Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley, Vernon Isley, and Odessa Isley). While The Jackson 5 had five members as well, the composition of The Isley Brothers included both brothers and a cousin, making it a family band but not necessarily ""bigger"" in terms of sheer number of members. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that The Jackson 5 was a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers."
"(A) Yes

Lactobacillus is beneficial for making pickles, as it helps in the fermentation process, producing lactic acid that gives pickles their characteristic flavor and aids in preservation. While natural lactobacillus can be present, adding a starter culture ensures a consistent and controlled fermentation, leading to better results."

"(B) Yes

A person with Anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person due to the severe weight loss and nutritional deficiencies associated with the disorder. These factors can lead to weakened bones and increased susceptibility to fractures."
"(B) No

Sea shanties were associated with maritime activities and the sailing of ships, not overland travel. The travelers on the Oregon Trail in the 19th century were primarily focused on land transportation and would have sung songs more relevant to their journey, such as ballads about home, family, or the challenges of the trail."
"(A) Yes

Shooting a bald eagle can result in severe penalties under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. These laws can lead to fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. In comparison, Michael Vick's sentence for his dogfighting conviction was 23 months. Therefore, under these laws, shooting a bald eagle could indeed result in more prison time than Michael Vick's sentence."
"(B) No

Mahatma Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, well before the invention of television. The television show Bonanza first aired in 1959, which means Gandhi could not have watched it."

William Franklyn-Miller is not a professional NASCAR driver and does not compete in NASCAR events. Therefore, he would not be able to win a NASCAR Cup Series race."
"(B) No

Jacques Duèze and Richard Dawkins would not have been friends due to their fundamentally different beliefs and worldviews. Duèze was a French Roman Catholic priest and theologian with conservative views within the Catholic Church, while Dawkins is a prominent atheist and evolutionary biologist. Their philosophical and religious differences would have made it unlikely for them to share common interests or form a friendship."
"(B) No

Hiding a pet macaque under a desk is not advisable. Macaques are non-domesticated animals that require specific living conditions, including adequate space, social interaction, and environmental enrichment. Keeping a macaque in such a confined space is not only unethical but also illegal in many places. It can severely harm the animal's well-being and is not a responsible way to care for any pet."
"(B) No

Justin Bieber is a celebrity and musician, not a politician. Mike Pence served as the Vice President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. There were no plans or indications that Justin Bieber would run for or take over Mike Pence's position in 2020. The 2020 U.S. presidential election did not involve Justin Bieber as a candidate."
"(A) No

YouTube viewers typically do not receive unsolicited audiobook advice frequently. The platform's recommendation algorithms focus on video content and viewer interests, rather than promoting specific products like audiobooks. Such recommendations are more likely to come from other sources."

Based on my research into the history of animation studios and their personnel, there is no documented evidence of an excommunicable offense committed by the brother of Goofy's creator's employer. Goofy was created by Art Babbitt, who worked for Walt Disney. Walt Disney's brother was Roy O. Disney, but there is no record of him committing any excommunicable offense. Excommunicable offenses are typically serious religious violations, and without specific documentation, it is not possible to confirm such an event."
"The answer is (B) No.

Mental disorders typically manifest in ways that are difficult to hide. Even if an individual is highly skilled at managing their symptoms, the underlying condition can still affect their behavior, mood, and thought processes, making it noticeable to others. Additionally, untreated mental health issues often worsen over time, becoming even more apparent and challenging to conceal. Seeking help is crucial for effective management and treatment."
"(A) Yes

Paul Bunyan, known for his immense size and strength, would likely struggle with the intricate and delicate nature of urban planning. His methods, which are more suited to clearing vast forests, would be unsuitable for the careful balancing of urban needs such as housing, transportation, and green spaces. Therefore, he would be a poor choice for an urban planner."
"(A) Yes

Alcatraz Island is approximately 220 yards (201 meters) long and 420 yards (384 meters) wide. A standard American football field, including end zones, is 360 feet (110 meters) long and 160 feet (48.8 meters) wide. Given these dimensions, it would not be possible to fit a full-sized football field on the island without overlapping or leaving significant portions of the island unused."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable ingredient for a White Russian. The cocktail's flavor profile, which includes vodka, coffee liqueur (typically Kahlúa), and cream, is best maintained with ingredients that complement these base components. Kaffir lime's unique and strong citrus and floral notes would likely disrupt the harmonious balance of the drink."
"(A) Yes

A Goblin shark, if hypothetically given limbs, could potentially ride a bike. While it is a deep-sea fish and not adapted for life on land, the primary challenge would be the shark's anatomy and its transition to a terrestrial environment. Assuming the limbs could support its body weight and allow for the necessary movements, it might be able to ride a bike. However, this scenario involves significant biological and environmental adaptations that are currently beyond the shark's natural capabilities."
"(B) Yes

Kurt Cobain's music genre, grunge, has indeed survived after his death. The influence of grunge continued to shape alternative rock and other genres well beyond Cobain's passing. Many bands that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s carried forward the raw, emotional, and often socially conscious themes that defined grunge. This genre has remained a significant part of the music landscape, continuing to inspire new artists and fans alike."
"(B) No

A spice grinder can still be effective for grinding even the cheapest cinnamon sticks. While the quality and aroma of the cinnamon might be affected by its price, a spice grinder will effectively break down the sticks into smaller pieces, which can enhance flavor release and work well in various recipes."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery are weapons used to launch projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational principles. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons designed for military use, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. In contrast, slingshots are small, handheld devices that use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles, such as stones or small balls, over short to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."
"(A) No

While it is possible to eat some types of thick soups or stews with the hands, it is generally more appropriate and considerate to use utensils, especially in formal dining settings. Using utensils helps maintain hygiene and adheres to common dining etiquette standards."

The Capricorn astrology symbol features a sea goat, which has the body of a fish and the head and legs of a goat. This does not include the lion's head, serpent's tail, or eagle's wings that are part of the chimera's description. Therefore, the Capricorn symbol does not have all the parts of a chimera."
"(B) No

Dafne Keen is an actress and not a singer, so she would not be eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. The contest requires participants to be singers or performers with a strong musical background, and Dafne Keen has not been known to participate in or compete in the Eurovision Song Contest."
"(A) Yes

Iris and Hermes, both from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with some aspects of a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excelled at swift and efficient communication but her role did not involve tasks such as sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. While her divine speed would be an asset, her primary function in mythology was more about communication than physical delivery.

Hermes, as the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, would also face challenges. His speed and adaptability would be useful, but his role included guiding souls and playing tricks, which might not be the most helpful skills in a UPS job. Additionally, Hermes was often depicted as a trickster, which could lead to complications in a professional setting where reliability and adherence to rules are crucial.

Both deities would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which involves following specific procedures, adhering to schedules, and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job compared to a more fluid and less structured role like a messenger or courier."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, which consists mainly of cookies and other processed foods, does not align with the principles of the Paleo diet. The Paleo diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods such as meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, while avoiding grains, sugars, and other processed items.

Lactic acid is a normal byproduct of muscle metabolism, particularly during intense exercise. While it can cause muscle fatigue and the familiar burning sensation, it is not inherently bad for the body. The body naturally clears lactic acid after exercise. High levels of lactic acid can indicate a medical condition like lactic acidosis, but this is not a normal state and is usually associated with underlying health issues."
"(A) No

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to assassinate King James I and overthrow the Protestant monarchy by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. This plot did not target Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been executed in 1587. Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot did not eliminate the bloodline of Mary, Queen of Scots."
"(A) Yes

The main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Alice, could potentially join a Masonic Lodge if she were an adult and met the specific requirements of the Lodge. The Masonic Lodge is open to men who are of good character and meet the age and other membership criteria set by the particular Lodge or Grand Lodge. Since Alice is a fictional character, for her to join a Masonic Lodge in our world, she would need to be an adult and a man. Assuming these conditions are met, Alice could indeed become a member of a Masonic Lodge."
"(B) No

While both bull sharks and crocodiles are known for their powerful bites, crocodiles generally have a more intense and painful bite due to their larger jaw structure and the ability to exert significantly more force. Bull sharks, while capable of delivering a strong bite, do not match the force and impact of a crocodile's bite."

Avengers Comics, being part of the Marvel Comics universe, would be out of place in a DC Comics store. Each publisher has its own distinct characters, storylines, and branding, and separating their titles helps maintain brand identity and customer expectations."
"(B) No

Rhinoceroses have not been killed to improve human sex lives. Their horns are often targeted for the illegal wildlife trade, with some cultures believing they have medicinal or aphrodisiac properties. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. The horns are made of keratin, the same protein found in human hair and nails, and do not possess any sexual enhancement properties. The poaching of rhinos for their horns has led to significant threats to their populations, contributing to their conservation status as endangered or critically endangered species."
"(A) No

Star Wars fans might occasionally use ""beam me up"" humorously or mistakenly, but it is not a frequent part of their vocabulary."
"(A) Yes

The acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion can vary based on the context. In Christian communities, particularly those with strong Catholic or Orthodox traditions, such imagery is commonly worn and seen as a symbol of faith. However, in more secular or non-Christian settings, it might be viewed as controversial or inappropriate. Therefore, the acceptability depends on the specific cultural, religious, and social environment."

"(B) Yes

Bart Simpson could have owned comics with The Joker, as comic books featuring characters from the DC Comics universe are common in the ""Simpsons"" show. While the show typically focuses on Bart's collection of ""Simpsons""-related comics, it is not uncommon for the series to include references to other comic book characters and storylines. Therefore, it is entirely plausible for Bart to own a comic featuring The Joker."
"(A) Yes

Based on my knowledge of hip-hop artists and their relationships, 50 Cent and Jeffrey Atkins (also known as Method Man) have a positive relationship. They are both members of the Wu-Tang Clan, which has fostered a strong bond between them. Additionally, they have collaborated on various projects, further cementing their friendly and professional relationship."
"(A) No

In Somalia, the application of Sharia law varies significantly across different regions and communities. A celibate cleric is unlikely to face a stoning unless they are specifically accused of a crime that would warrant such a punishment, such as adultery. Additionally, the likelihood of such a punishment being enforced depends on the local legal and cultural context. In many areas, more lenient interpretations of Sharia law or secular laws may be applied. Therefore, without specific accusations and in the absence of a legal system that mandates such severe punishments, a celibate cleric is not likely to suffer a stoning."
"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden, which is located in Scandinavia. It plays a crucial role in the Swedish political system."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should have a slight firmness to it, known as al dente, and should not be overly soft or sticky. A slick texture suggests the pasta may have been overcooked or cooked in too much water, which can lead to a mushy or unappetizing result."

"(B) No

John Kerry did not run in the 2010 United Kingdom general election. The 2010 UK general election was a contest between UK-based political parties and candidates, and John Kerry, being a former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State, was not involved in UK politics at that time."
"(A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password when used appropriately. A strong password should include a mix of character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can contribute to the complexity and strength of a password. However, it's crucial to ensure the password is long (at least 12-16 characters), random, and not based on easily guessable information like common words or patterns."
"(A) No

Rainbows typically appear as a semi-circular arc in the sky. For a full circle of a rainbow to be visible, the observer must be positioned at the exact anti-solar point, where the sun is at a low angle (usually below 42 degrees) and the observer is looking at a reflective surface like water or mist. This condition is rare and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach. Therefore, lunch on the beach is not a good activity to spot a full circle of a rainbow."
"(A) Yes

As an expert in international legal roles, it is clear that Abdulqawi Yusuf, having served as the President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), would have a typical workday that involves frequent visits to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that he would go to The Hague on a typical workday."
"(A) No

Nancy Drew is a fictional character who solves mysteries, but she is not considered a private investigator in the professional sense.

Nancy Drew, on the other hand, is an amateur sleuth who often solves cases for personal reasons or as a hobby, making her distinct from a licensed private investigator."
"(A) No

Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford had significantly different political affiliations. Gerald Ford was a Republican and served as the 38th President of the United States, while Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. Given their differing party affiliations and political stances, it is unlikely that they would have been on the same side on most issues."
"(A) No

An explosion at a gunpowder storage facility would not result in a supersonic shock wave.

"(B) No

Jon Brower Minnoch did not suffer from anorexia nervosa. His condition was characterized by hyperphagia and severe obesity, which were not related to an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is marked by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, often involving restrictive eating behaviors, which was not the case for Minnoch."
"(A) No

H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" does not include cosmic rays. The novel, published in 1898, predates the discovery of cosmic rays, which were first identified in the early 20th century. The story focuses on a Martian invasion and does not incorporate scientific concepts that were not yet known at the time of its writing."
"(B) No

The religions that consider the Himalayas to be sacred, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, have much older origins. Hinduism dates back to the Vedic period, around 1500 BCE, and Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE. Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(A) Yes

White rice does not go rancid in the same way that sesame seeds can. Rancidity is a process that typically affects foods containing significant amounts of fats and oils, such as sesame seeds. While white rice can spoil through other means, such as mold growth, it does not undergo rancidity. Therefore, sesame seeds are more prone to going rancid than white rice."
"(B) No

Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections and has no effect on learning disabilities, which are neurological conditions affecting learning and processing information."
"(B) No

Cancer does not directly cause excess adrenaline production. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is primarily produced by the adrenal medulla, which is part of the adrenal glands. While certain tumors or conditions can affect the adrenal glands and lead to excess adrenaline production (a condition known as pheochromocytoma), this is not a direct result of cancer itself. Cancer can cause various hormonal imbalances and other physiological changes, but excess adrenaline production is not one of them."
"(A) No

Vellore Fort, located in Vellore, India, was primarily constructed to defend against external threats such as invasions and rebellions. There is no historical evidence to suggest that grizzly bears, which are native to North America, ever posed a threat to the fort's occupants. Therefore, the occupants of Vellore Fort did not need to defend themselves from grizzly bears."
"(A) No

The brain is located in the skull, which is part of the head, not in the torso. The torso contains other important organs such as the heart, lungs, and digestive system."
"A: Yes

To determine if a 500GB USB device is sufficient for storing 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to calculate the storage requirements for 10 hours of high-quality streaming content. High-quality streaming (1080p) typically uses around 6 Mbps. 

1 hour of 1080p content at 6 Mbps is approximately 360 MB. For 10 hours, this amounts to 360 MB/hour * 10 hours = 3600 MB or 3.6 GB. 

Given that a 500GB USB device has a capacity of 500,000 MB, it is more than sufficient to store 3.6 GB of content. Therefore, a 500GB USB device is indeed enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day."
"(A) No

Jon Brower Minnoch's maximum recorded weight was 635 kg, while the launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 815 kg. Since Minnoch's weight is less than the mass of Voyager 2, he would not be able to break a chair before the Voyager 2 launch."

"(A) No

The iPhone, while a groundbreaking technological product, did not initiate a scientific revolution. The term ""scientific revolution"" typically refers to a period of significant transformation in scientific thought and methodology that occurred primarily in the 16th and 17th centuries. This period saw major advancements in fields such as astronomy, physics, and mathematics, fundamentally altering our understanding of the natural world. In contrast, the iPhone has had a profound impact on consumer electronics, mobile computing, and communication, but it does not represent a similar shift in scientific thought or methodology."
"(B) No

Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language (ASL). While it can influence which hand is more dominant during signing, it does not dictate the specific signs or the way they are performed. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to whether a person is right-handed or left-handed. Factors such as individual signing style, context, and familiarity with ASL play a more significant role in how ASL is used."

"(A) No

Aviation accidents can be complex, and responsibility often lies with multiple parties. While United Airlines was not at fault for the catastrophic engine failure that caused the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989, the airline has been found at fault in other incidents. For instance, the crash of United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977 was due to pilot error, for which the airline was held responsible. Therefore, it would be incorrect to claim that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No

Substituting bowling pins with Oscars would be impractical and potentially dangerous, making the correct answer (A) No."
"(A) No

A beaver's teeth and a Smilodon's teeth are quite different in both size and function. Beavers have strong, continuously growing incisors designed for cutting wood, while Smilodon had long, blade-like canine teeth for slicing through the flesh of their prey. Therefore, a beaver's teeth would not rival those of a Smilodon in terms of size or function."
"(B) Yes, the rise of agriculture is often attributed to rivers due to the significant advantages they provided. Rivers offered a reliable water supply for irrigation, fertile soil from annual flooding, and a means of transportation. These factors were crucial for the development of early agricultural societies."
"(A) No

While art education is often included in the U.S. education system, it is not universally prioritized.

Harry Potter is a fictional character and does not have the capability to book a flight on Asiana Airlines or any other airline."
"(A) Yes

While Steven Spielberg was born in 1946, the technology for sending emails as we know them today did not exist until much later. Email systems were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and it wasn't until the 1990s that email became widely available to the general public. Therefore, as a child, Steven Spielberg would not have been able to send emails."
"(A) Yes

Theodor Seuss Geisel's consistent use of the color green in his illustrations played a significant role in establishing his unique style and contributing to his fame. This distinctive color choice helped create a recognizable and beloved aesthetic in his books, enhancing his creative output and making him a household name."
"(A) No

The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was constructed on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, during the 3rd century BC. While the project was overseen by Greek architects and engineers, it involved local Egyptian labor and materials. The design and construction techniques were influenced by Greek architectural principles, but the involvement of Greeks was part of the broader Hellenistic culture that had a significant impact on the region. Therefore, Greeks were not essential to crafting the lighthouse alone; it was a collaborative effort involving both Greek expertise and local resources."
"(A) No

Keith Richards, the renowned guitarist of The Rolling Stones, has not played a role as a captain of a boat in any movie. While he has appeared in various films, including ""Crossfire Hurricane"" and ""The Lost City of Z,"" he has not taken on the role of a boat captain."

Preventive healthcare measures are effective in reducing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These include regular STI testing, consistent and correct use of condoms, vaccination against certain STIs like HPV and hepatitis B, practicing monogamy with an uninfected partner, and maintaining open communication with sexual partners about STI status. Regular screenings help in early detection and treatment, thereby reducing the risk of transmission to others."
"(B) No

The story of Jesus, as presented in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is not considered to be directly inspired by Egyptian myths. While there are some parallels between certain elements of the Jesus narrative and various mythological or cultural traditions, these parallels are often seen as coincidental or the result of common human experiences and storytelling techniques. The development of the Christian narrative about Jesus was influenced by a variety of factors, including Jewish religious traditions, Greek and Roman philosophical ideas, and the cultural context of the early Christian communities. Therefore, the story of Jesus is not primarily or directly inspired by Egyptian myths."
"The answer is (B) No.

Methuselah, as recorded in the Bible, is said to have lived for 969 years. In the Common Era, which begins on January 1, 1 CE, no human has reached such an age. The longest confirmed human lifespan is significantly shorter, with the record held by Jeanne Calment at 122 years and 164 days. Therefore, Methuselah would not hold a record in the Common Era."

"(B) Yes

To determine if Jason and Dr. Disrespect have anything in common, we need to consider their roles and activities. Dr. Disrespect is a well-known figure in the gaming and esports community, known for his commentary and content creation. If Jason is also involved in similar fields, such as gaming, content creation, or esports, they likely share commonalities in their professional activities and audience engagement."
"(B) No

Deaf people can certainly enjoy music through various means. They may experience music through vibrations, visual representations like music videos or sign language interpretations, and tactile sensations from speakers. Many deaf individuals also engage in musical activities, such as playing instruments that do not produce sound or using sign language to express their appreciation and understanding of music."
"(B) No

Human footprints are not absent from Mount Sharp. While there are no actual human footprints on the surface of Mount Sharp on Mars, the marks left by the wheels of the Curiosity rover can be considered a form of human presence. These marks are a result of the rover's traversals across the terrain and are evidence of human exploration of the site."
"(A) No

"(A) No

The Eiffel Tower was not used as a symbol of the French Revolution. The tower was constructed in the late 19th century for the 1889 Exposition Universelle and did not exist during the time of the French Revolution, which occurred in the late 18th century."
"The answer is (A) No.

The torso is not inherently protected by the largest or smallest bones in the body. The largest bones, such as the femur or pelvis, and the smallest bones, like those in the ear or phalanges of the fingers, do not directly shield the torso. The torso contains vital organs that require more robust protection, which is provided by the ribcage, sternum, and spinal column. However, even with these protective structures, a direct and forceful blow can still cause significant injury to the torso."
"(B) Yes

Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu lived during the 14th century in the Ottoman Empire. Given the cultural and culinary traditions of the time, it is highly probable that he would have eaten börek, a traditional Turkish pastry. As a prominent figure in the Ottoman Empire, it is reasonable to assume that he would have been familiar with and likely enjoyed this common and beloved dish."
"(A) No

King Kong, when climbing the Empire State Building in the film, would not be at a higher altitude than visitors to the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower stands at an elevation of about 330 feet (100 meters) above sea level, while the Empire State Building is approximately 1,454 feet (443 meters) tall. Even when King Kong reaches the top of the Empire State Building, he would still be at a lower altitude than the upper levels of the Eiffel Tower, which visitors can access."

"(B) No

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was deeply committed to socialist economic policies that aimed to achieve economic equality and reduce income disparities. Trickle-down economics, which posits that benefits to the wealthy will eventually benefit the broader population, is fundamentally at odds with these principles. The CPSU implemented policies such as state ownership of the means of production, centralized economic planning, and measures to redistribute wealth, all of which were designed to ensure that resources were distributed more equitably. Therefore, the CPSU would not support trickle-down economics."

While using an armadillo as a shield might not be practical or advisable, theoretically, it is possible. Armadillos have a tough, armored shell that can provide some protection. However, several factors make this impractical:

1. **Size and Speed**: Armadillos are small and can move quickly, which limits their effectiveness as a stationary shield.
2. **Mobility**: Using an armadillo as a shield would significantly restrict its mobility.
3. **Durability**: Although the shell is tough, it is not indestructible and could be damaged or penetrated by powerful attacks.
4. **Ethical and Practical Considerations**: Using a living creature as a shield raises ethical concerns and could be illegal in many jurisdictions. It would also be impractical and potentially harmful to the armadillo.

In summary, while it is theoretically possible to use an armadillo as a shield, it is not a practical or advisable method."

The Statue of Unity in India stands at 182 meters (597 feet) tall, while the Statue of Liberty in the United States is approximately 93 meters (305 feet) tall from the base of the pedestal to the tip of the torch. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, an ancient structure, is estimated to have been around 135 meters (440 feet) tall. Given these heights, the Statue of Unity is taller than both the Statue of Liberty and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Therefore, it is not hypothetically more level with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria."

"(A) No

Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran, was a secular leader who did not adhere to the specific religious beliefs of Shia Islam, which includes the concept of Imams. The number of Imams in Shia Islam is 12, but since Reza Shah was not a follower of Shia Islam, this number is not relevant to his beliefs. On the other hand, the New Testament of the Christian Bible lists 12 apostles, who are often referred to as Jesus's disciples. Therefore, the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in (if any) would not exceed the number of Jesus's disciples."
"(B) Yes

Multiple Christmas carols are indeed named after saints. For instance, ""St. Louis, King of France"" honors St. Louis IX, who was canonized as a saint.

Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law in the late 19th century would not be considered fair by today's standards. The legal and societal norms at the time were highly restrictive and punitive towards sexual behaviors that deviated from the norm.

"(A) No

Paul the Apostle is believed to have died in Rome around 67 AD. Historical accounts suggest that he was beheaded, which is generally considered a form of execution. While this method of death is not ideal, it does not inherently violate the principle of Ahimsa, as this principle primarily focuses on the intent and actions during one's lifetime rather than the manner of death. Therefore, Paul's cause of death does not violate the tenets of Ahimsa."
"(A) No

The ""holy trinity"" in French cuisine, particularly in Cajun and Creole cooking, traditionally includes bell peppers, onions, and celery. However, if you cannot use celery, you can still create a similar base by substituting it with other vegetables.

The largest ship from Christopher Columbus's voyages, the Santa Maria, was significantly smaller than the dimensions required to transport the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty stands at 93 meters (305 feet) tall and weighs approximately 225 tons, far exceeding the capacity and size limitations of any ship from Columbus's era. Therefore, it would not be possible for the largest ship from Columbus's voyages to haul the Statue of Liberty."

To watch all 221 episodes of ""JAG"" in six months, assuming each episode is approximately 45 minutes long, the total viewing time would be:

221 episodes * 45 minutes/episode = 9945 minutes

Converting this to hours:

9945 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 165.75 hours

If you have 180 days in six months, you would need to watch:

165.75 hours / 180 days = approximately 0.92 hours/day

This is roughly 55 minutes per day, which is a feasible amount of time to watch the show consistently. Therefore, you could indeed watch all of ""JAG"" in six months."

The high costs associated with transporting and distributing bottled water to such a remote area would likely outweigh any potential revenue."
"(A) No

Pope Alexander VI, whose birth name was Rodrigo Borgia, was the first Spanish pope in papal history. While his origin was unique, it is not accurate to say that it was the least represented nationality. There were other non-Italian popes before him, such as Pope Adrian IV (born in England) and Pope Clement V (born in France). Therefore, the statement that his origin was the least represented in papal history is incorrect."

Therefore, it would not be accurate to consider Cambodia ""too expensive"" for the richest billionaire to own."
"(B) No

The 40th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, served from 1977 to 1981. The concept of lolcats, which involve pictures of cats with humorous captions, did not emerge until much later, around 2006-2007. Therefore, it is not possible for Jimmy Carter to have forwarded lolcats to his friends."
"(A) Yes

Ancient Greece consisted of numerous independent city-states, often numbering around 1,000 at its peak. In contrast, the United States had only 45 states in 1900.

"(A) Yes

White cockatoos, such as the Umbrella Cockatoo, can live for several decades in captivity. Given that the Thirty Years' War lasted from 1618 to 1648, a bird of this species could potentially have lived through the entire conflict.

"(A) No

While ""The Jungle Book"" was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time marked by colonialism and racial hierarchies, a careful analysis of the text reveals that it can be read in a way that transcends its historical context. The characters and themes in the original stories by Rudyard Kipling are often interpreted through a modern lens that focuses on universal messages of friendship, family, and the balance between nature and civilization. 

Moreover, subsequent adaptations and reimaginings of the story have often aimed to address and mitigate any potential biases. For instance, the 1967 Disney animated film and its subsequent adaptations have been reinterpreted to be more inclusive and less problematic, often highlighting the positive relationships between characters from different backgrounds.

Therefore, while the historical context of the original work may raise concerns, the story itself can be appreciated for its broader, more universal themes that resonate with a wide audience."

The blues harp, played by James Cotton, can indeed produce strident sounds, but with the right technique and musical context, it can fit well within a smooth jazz band. Smooth jazz typically blends elements of jazz, R&B, and funk, and can accommodate a variety of instruments and playing styles. A skilled harp player can control the dynamics to ensure the instrument's sound complements the smoother, more polished tones characteristic of smooth jazz. Therefore, James Cotton's instrument would not be too strident for a smooth jazz band."

"(A) No

Japanese serfdom, if we consider the historical context of the samurai and peasant classes, generally had a lower status compared to the English serfdom of the medieval period. In Japan, peasants (minshu) were tied to the land but had more rights and mobility compared to European serfs. Serfs in medieval Europe were legally bound to the land and had fewer rights, facing harsher conditions and less freedom. Therefore, the status of serfs in Japan was typically higher than that of serfs in medieval Europe."

While J.D. Salinger's works, particularly ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" have been widely read and influential, attributing specific criminal actions to these works is overly simplistic. The influence of literature on an individual's behavior is complex and often part of a broader set of factors, including personal history, mental health, and social context. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that J.D. Salinger's most successful work has a direct and significant influence on killers."
"(B) No

In comparison, other European revolutions and conflicts, such as the French Revolution and the Spanish Civil War, resulted in much higher death tolls."

"(B) No

Woodrow Wilson, as the 28th President of the United States, would not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. This 1896 Supreme Court case upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, which was a cornerstone of racial segregation in the United States. While Wilson had complex views on race and did not openly advocate for racial equality, his actions, such as the segregation of federal agencies during his presidency, indicate a stance that was not in line with the principles of the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he would have supported this decision."
"(B) Yes

The 1980 Summer Olympics, also known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad, took place in Moscow from July 19 to August 3, 1980. ""The Atlantic"" magazine, established in 1857, would have been in circulation during this period. Therefore, it was certainly possible to read ""The Atlantic"" magazine during the Games of the XXII Olympiad."
"(B) Yes

A paraplegic can certainly conduct an orchestra. The physical demands of conducting, such as the need for upper body strength and precise hand and arm movements, can be managed with appropriate training and adaptations. Many conductors have physical limitations, and paraplegia does not inherently prevent someone from conducting effectively. The key factors are the individual's musical talent, experience, and ability to lead and inspire the orchestra."
"(A) No

Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation, passed away on April 23, 2007. The 2008 Summer Olympics took place in Beijing, China, from August 8 to August 24, 2008. Given these dates, it is clear that Boris Yeltsin could not have watched the 2008 Summer Olympics."
"(A) No

While both Darth Vader and Severus Snape are complex characters with significant depth, they differ markedly in their personalities, motivations, and roles within their respective franchises. Darth Vader is a Sith Lord who transitions from a villain to a more sympathetic figure, while Severus Snape starts as a mysterious and often antagonistic character but ultimately becomes a key ally. Their methods, loyalties, and interactions with other characters are distinct, making it inaccurate to say that Darth Vader's character closely resembles Severus Snape's."
"(A) No

In the United States, the legal age to drive varies by state, typically ranging from 16 to 18 years old. Even if a child is licensed to drive, employment laws have specific restrictions for minors. These laws often include age limits, work hours, and types of employment. Therefore, it would generally not be legal for a child to be employed in a position that requires driving, regardless of their driving license status."
"(B) No

Retail environments often provide training and support, making it a versatile field for people with different skills and backgrounds. Effective communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills are highly valued, but these can be developed through on-the-job training. Therefore, retail is indeed a job that many people can be suited for."
"(A) No

The modern Brazilian Navy, with its advanced technology and modern ships, would not have been able to turn the tide in the Battle of Actium. The battle took place in 31 BC, using naval technology and tactics that are fundamentally different from those of today. The ships and strategies employed by Octavian's forces were specifically tailored to the conditions and technologies of their time, making it impossible for a modern navy to replicate or significantly alter the outcome."
